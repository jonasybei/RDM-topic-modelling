      "The FAIR principles12  (F - Findable, A - Accessible, I - Interoperable, R - Reusable) play an important part in efforts towards open science.  They describe some of the most central guidelines for sound data management and open access to electronic research data.  Research data do not need be in digital form originally, but efficient accessibility and FAIR implementation require data in digital form.  The FAIR principles were published for the first time in 2016 and since then the EU and a number of research funders, universities and research infrastructures have endorsed them. In Sweden,  the Research Council and the Royal Library have the government's mandate to develop criteria for assessing the extent to which research data and scholarly publications meet the FAIR principles.13 Altogether, FAIR comprises 15 principles which can be applied to research in all disciplines.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Handling digital research data at Karlstad University should follow the international FAIR principles to the extent it is practicable.  Karlstad University strives to make research data with related meta data findable, accessible and reusable for new research purposes long-term, which generally means several generations of the hard and software required for the processing.  \n",
      "\n",
      "However, it is important to note that the FAIR principles do not entail that digital research data should always be open and accessible to everyone. Research ethical assessments, information provided to research participants, personal data protection legislation, and secrecy are factors that always warrant attention before research data can be made accessible beyond the research group, as described under section 5 above.\n",

Research data that has been fully or partially financed by public funds and forms the basis of published results must therefore be openly available, to the extent possible with due reference to legal, ethical and possible commercial aspects. KTH supports the internationally adopted FAIR principles to ensure that research data shall be findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable. These principles are compatible with the motto âAs open as possible, as closed as necessaryâ., 1.3 Publication of research data  \n",
      "\n",
      "As a basic principle, research data that forms the basis of published research results should be made publicly available and be findable in such a way that data can be reused. When publishing research data or metadata about research data, KTH Royal Institute of Technology should be given as affiliation in the same way as for any other publication (see also Guidelines on Scientific Publications). It is also appropriate for the dataset to be assigned a persistent identifier and for there to be an opportunity for versioning when data is made available in connection with publication.  \n",

      "Metadata must state clearly what conditions apply for access and reproduction of the dataset. If there are legal, ethical or commercial obstacles to complete digital availability, it is recommended that metadata be published describing the dataset including the conditions for access. If the publication of metadata is also considered inappropriate with regard to the protection of critical infrastructure or with regard to Swedenâs national security or information security in general, publication must be avoided.\n",

Here are three examples:\n\n1. **Publication and Metadata Management**: The documents emphasize the importance of publishing research data and metadata in a way that adheres to the FAIR principles. For instance, ETH Zurich's guidelines state that research data and programming code must be published along with rich, openly available Metadata, ensuring that they are findable and accessible. This practice involves assigning unique identifiers to data and metadata, which enhances their findability, and using standardized vocabularies to ensure interoperability.\n\n2. **Data Accessibility and Interoperability**: Helmholtz Munich's guidelines highlight the importance of making data accessible through web interfaces or dedicated data publications, which can include open distribution of data and metadata. This approach ensures that data is accessible and interoperable, as it can be accessed by both humans and machines, and is stored in a trusted repository using open file formats and common standards.\n\n3. **Data Reuse and Licensing**: The University of Edinburgh's guidelines stress the need for research data to be reusable, which involves providing clear data usage licenses and detailed provenance information. This ensures that data can be reused ethically and scientifically, and that the conditions for access and reproduction are clearly stated, promoting the FAIR principle of reusability.\n\nThese examples illustrate how the documents operationalize the FAIR principles by focusing on findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability, ensuring that research data is prepared in a way that maximizes its utility and longevity."

      "A Bangor University student should only use personal data, in relation to their studies, with the knowledge, written agreement and supervision of an appropriate member of staff. This would normally be a postgraduate studentâs supervisor, or for an undergraduate student the member of staff responsible for teaching the module. Consideration should also be given to the requirements of the Universityâs Research Ethics Policy in relation to the use of personal data in research.  \n",

Background  \n",
      "\n",
      "These Procedures are intended to cover situations where the University receives requests from the Police or other organisations / agencies with law enforcement responsibilities (such as the Department for Work and Pensions, local authorities, HM Customs and Revenue and the UK Visas and Immigration) for personal information about students, staff or other individuals whose information the University holds.  These Procedures also include requests for the provision of any CCTV footage2.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Personal information held by the University is managed in accordance with the Data Protection Act 2018 (the Act) and the Universityâs Data Protection Policy3.  The Act and the Universityâs Policy provide guidance on the circumstances when it is lawful to disclose and transfer personal information outside the University and in general this should be carried out âfairly and lawfullyâ and in accordance with the Universityâs Data Protection Notification.  \n",
      "\n",
      "There are, however, exemptions within the Act which allow the University, under strict guidelines, to release information to law enforcement agencies without the consent of the individual whose information is being released, and regardless of the purpose for which the information was originally collected.  \n",
      "\n",
      "In particular personal information may be released if:  \n",
      "\n",
      "the information is required for safeguarding national security failure to provide the information would prejudice the prevention or detection of crime, the apprehension or prosecution of offenders or the assessment or collection of any tax or duty  \n",

      "Personal information may also be disclosed without contravening the terms of the Act where that disclosure is required by law.  \n",

      "These Procedures should also be considered in conjunction with the Universityâs Prevent Policy and its Information Sharing Agreement with partners to the Prevent and Channel Programme., [a] Police Requests  \n",
      "\n",
      "All police forces have standard forms which must be used to request personal information from Bangor University, in accordance with guidance issued by the Association of Chief Police Officers.  The form must certify that the information is required for an investigation concerning national security, the prevention or detection of crime or the apprehension or prosecution of offenders, and that the investigation would be prejudiced by a failure to disclose the information.  All requests from the police, (apart from emergency requests, which are dealt with at section 4. below,) should be received on a data protection form, should clearly state all the information being requested and should be signed and dated by an officer of the rank of Sergeant or above., [b] Other Agencies with Law Enforcement Responsibilities  \n",
      "\n",
      "Other agencies may not routinely use standard forms to submit their requests.  However, any request for personal information should:  \n",

      "Describe the nature of the information which is requested;   \n",
      "Describe the nature of the investigation in broad terms, including citing any relevant statutory authority for requesting the information;   \n",
      "Certify that the information is necessary for the investigation.  \n",
      "\n",
      "On receipt of such a request the data would normally be disclosed, after due consideration of the Universityâs legal position to provide such data, by the Head of Governance and Compliance., 4. Requests for Disclosure of Information in Emergency Situations  \n",
      "\n",
      "The University acknowledges that, from time to time and in extraordinary circumstances, police forces, other law enforcement agencies or other emergency services may urgently require personal data from the University and may not be in a position to complete the usual required paperwork at that time.  These requests are usually received by the Universityâs Security Section but may be received by any member of staff. Requests of this type would include urgent requests for provision of CCTV footage for genuine police operational reasons and / or requests for contact information for members of staff or students.  \n",
      "\n",
      "In these circumstances, during normal office hours, staff should contact the Compliance and Records Officer or the Head of Governance and Compliance, in the first instance for advice and authorisation before providing any information / CCTV footage.  \n",
      "\n",
      "If the request is being dealt with out of normal office hours, during University holidays or at a weekend and information or images are required immediately to deal with an ongoing police or other law enforcement incident the procedures outlined below should be followed:  \n",
      "\n",
      "1. The Universityâs Security Section should note all of the emergency information required, the circumstances of the request and the name, rank and number of the requesting Police Officer.  \n",
      "\n",
      "2. Authorisation and / or advice should then be sought advice from the Campus Services Manager (Security) or Deputy.   \n",
      "3. Where the request isnât straightforward, or the information isnât easily located the Campus Services Manager (Security) or Deputy may seek advice from the Head of Governance and Compliance.   \n",
      "4. Once the release of information or images is authorised the Security Team Leader or Assistant should note in the security log the exact circumstances of the request, the name, rank and number of the requesting Police Officer. This information should be forwarded to the Compliance and Records Officer and the Head of Governance and Compliance as soon as practicably possible.   \n",
      "5. If information / images are released in emergency circumstances the Governance and Compliance Team will ensure that the request is followed up with a formal written request from the relevant law enforcement agency, either by supplying a data protection form or a letter on headed paper appropriately authorised.\n",
