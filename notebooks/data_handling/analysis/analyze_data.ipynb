Open access publishing of research data aims to make research data easily discoverable, assessable, intelligible, usable and interoperable. Where applicable, these requirements can also be applied to data other than open access published research data, and to the software needed to handle the open data. The decisions to publish software, other than the software explicitly needed to handle the data, are done using the same conscious and strategic grounds as opening of the research data.  \\n\\nOwnership of copyright protected research data is transferred to Aalto University if the data is created in an externally funded research project of Aalto University.  Strategic decisions about opening such data are done by the principal investigators. These decisions are done following the guidelines for ethical principles of research as well as the guidelines for responsible conduct of research, project agreements and guidelines for processing of personal data in scientific research,   \\n   \\n\\nResearch data is not opened if the opening would violate privacy, safety, security, terms of project agreements or legitimate concerns of private partners. Researchers shall follow the \"Guideline on nondisclosure of information and information security classification at Aalto University\" and its appendix \"Rules on the handling of information materials\".    \\n\\nWhen deciding on the opening of research data, the possibilities for commercially exploiting the research results and data are taken into consideration. Aalto University will make agreements about the user rights of third parties according to the strategic goals of the university. Aalto University may also charge a fee from third parties for the use of research data.  \\n\\nOpenness of scientific research data will increase the scientific impact of the research, speed up the adoption of research findings and the creation of innovations, enable transparency in science, as well as ensure that research data has wide societal impact and usability in solving global challenges.  \\n\\nOpening access to research data shall be made easy for researchers and implemented in a cost-effective manner so that the resources invested are proportioned to the benefits attainable. An appropriate digital infrastructure will be made available to the researchers by combined European, national and Aalto University efforts.  \\n\\nThe Aalto University research data management policy applies to digital research materials produced, used and revised in research projects, i.e. research data. Physical materials on which research data are based shall be excluded from research data, along with the use of biological research materials. The concept of  \\n\\nAalto University Research Data   \\nManagement Policy   \\nDecision by president of 10 February 2016   \\nAppendix 1  \\n\\nresearch data is not specified further in this policy, as the quality and quantity of research data that is chosen for open access publishing is also chosen using the criteria above. (As regards university document preservation, a data management plan (DMP) required by the Archives Act and the instructions provided by Aalto University’s Archive and Registry Services  shall be abided by.)  \\n\\n### Principles for open access publishing of research data (recommended to be acknowledged in data management in general, where applicable)  \\n\\n#### 1. Discoverability  \\n\\nThe location of research data and the necessary software to access the data is known and they are easily discoverable and identifiable by means of a standard international identification mechanism.  \\n\\n#### 2. Accessibility  \\n\\nResearch data and the necessary software to access the data shall be easily accessible, along with other necessary information to access the data, such as a mention of the concerned research areas.  \\n\\nAn embargo period can be agreed upon, to achieve strategic advantage for the creator. The embargo period is expressed in connection with the material.  \\n\\nFor the research data, a licensing framework has been selected for research and educational use and for commercial exploitation. The license recommended for research data is Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) and the waiver recommended for metadata is CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication. The license recommended for software is the MIT Licence. Other licenses may be chosen to achieve the strategic goals of the research project. If research data is published using the CC BY 4.0 license, Aalto University and researchers obtain sufficient rights for the re-use of the data, even though the ownership of the research data is not transferred to the University. The terms of the CC BY 4.0 license require that the creators of the research data are attributed.  \\n\\n#### 3. Assessability and intelligibility  \\n\\nThe research data and the necessary software to access the data shall be assessable for and intelligible to third parties for scientific scrutiny and peer review. Research data shall be published together with related scientific publications for the purposes of peer review. Research data shall be provided in a way that judgements can be made about its reliability and the competence of those who created it.  \\n\\n#### 4. Usability  \\n\\nThe research data and the necessary software to access the data shall also be usable for purposes beyond the original project. The research data chosen for long-term preservation shall be safely stored and curated to ensure its usability for wider needs than merely a highly specialised expert group. Whenever possible, certified repositories are used for research data preservation.  \\n\\nResearch data shall be stored together with the minimum metadata and documentation to make it useful. Aalto University does not require the creator of the research data to offer support for further use of the data.  \\n\\nWhen applicable and allowed by previous licenses, the necessary software will also be stored together with the research data.  \\n\\n#### 5. Interoperability  \\n\\nThe research data and the necessary software shall be produced in a manner that ensures their interoperability with applicable standards and special quality requirements. Interoperability shall be implemented in a way that allows data exchange between researcher groups, higher education institutions and research institutions in different countries. Interoperability will also allow for the re-combination of different datasets from different origins.  \\n\\n### Related documents and agreements  \\n\\nFinnish Advisory Board on Research Integrity

Research data will be managed to the highest standards throughout the research data lifecycle as part of the University’s commitment to research excellence.   \\n2. Responsibility for research data management during any research project or programme lies primarily with Principal Investigators (PIs).   \\n3. All new research proposals must include a Data Management Plan (DMP) that explicitly addresses data capture, management, storage, integrity, associated costs, confidentiality, retention, sharing, and publication.  \\n\\n4. The legitimate interests of any human participants of research must be protected.  \\n\\n5. Research data and records should be:  \\n\\nAccurate, documented, complete, authentic, and reliable   \\n• Stored in a safe and secure manner   \\n• Stored in a manner which is compliant with legal obligations and, where applicable, the requirements of funding bodies and project-specific protocols approved by the University’s Research Ethics Panel   \\n• Able to be made available to others in line with appropriate ethical, data sharing, and open access principles Data which is shared openly should follow FAIR principles; Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reuseable   \\n6. Research data and any associated records should be retained for as long as they are of continuing value to the researcher and the wider research community, and as long as specified by the research funder, patent law, legislative, or other regulatory requirements. The minimum retention period for research data is three (3) years after publication or public release of the research. In many instances, researchers or the university will resolve to retain research data for a period surpassing the minimum requirement or indefinitely.   \\n7. Published research papers should include a short statement describing how any supporting research data may be accessed, e.g. though citation and the use of a DOI link.   \\n8. Subject to third party interests, research data which supports a scholarly work produced by a member of University staff, shall be owned by the University and retained for an appropriate period of time in accordance with point 6. This period may extend beyond the period of employment of the staff member with the University.   \\n9. Subject to third party interests, research data which supports a scholarly work produced by a student of the University, will remain the intellectual property of the student and be retained for an appropriate period of time in accordance with point 6.   \\n10. If research data or records are to be deleted or destroyed, this should be done so in accordance with University Information Compliance procedures. With all legal, ethical, funder, and collaborator requirements met, and with particular concern for confidentiality and security.   \\n11. Research data will be offered for deposit and archival in the University repository, or an appropriate national, international, or discipline-specific repository. With a metadata record always created in the University repository.   \\n12. The University will provide training, support, advice, and where appropriate, guidelines and templates for research data management and data management plans.   \\n13. Exclusive (and non-exclusive) rights to publish research data should not be handed over for commercial purposes free of charge. The University must retain the right to publish, subject to confidentiality provisions and/or contractual obligations dictated by funding conditions, or as directed by the University’s Intellectual Property Policy. Any such commercial license must be negotiated between the requesting party and the University.   \\n14. The University will advise on, and provide mechanisms and services for, storage, backup, registration, deposit, and archival of research data , during and after the completion of research projects.

       "# Research Data Management Policy  \\n\\nJuly 2023  \\n\\n## Aston University Research Data Management Policy  \\n\\n### 1. INTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE  \\n\\nThe maintenance of accurate and retrievable data arising from research projects is an essential component of good practice in the conduct of research and a key component of research integrity and research reproducibility. Consideration around research data management and evidence of good research data management should be seen as an integral part of the research process, which is what Aston University expects of all researchers. This is in line with Aston’s values and commitment to deliver research that changes lives for the better through collaborations between students, academic staff and industry leaders.  \\n\\nIn addition, good research data management can benefit the transparency, productivity and overall reliability of the research generated, supporting the research process and visibility of any research outputs. Evidence of good research data management is also a requirement of most funding bodies and publishers of journal articles. Aston University is committed to supporting its researchers to meet the highest standards of research data management and acknowledges that research data management involves numerous stakeholders across the research data lifecycle, from creation through to dissemination and preservation. Therefore, this policy is divided into distinct sections aimed at key stakeholders within the University.  \\n\\nThe University endorses the UKRI Common Principles on Data Policy.  \\n\\n#### 1.1. Purpose of the Policy  \\n\\nThis policy covers Aston’s approach to research data management.  \\n\\nThe purpose of this policy is to:  \\n\\nEnsure that researchers manage their research data effectively, enabling them to:  \\n\\nDemonstrate the highest standards of integrity of their research, Preserve eligible research data for sharing and reuse (as appropriate), Comply with ethical, legal, funder and other requirements in relation to research data and research data management.  \\n\\nEnsure that University Colleges understand their responsibilities in relation to governance of research data management in their departments, Ensure that the University responsibilities for research data management are clearly articulated.  \\n\\n### 2. SCOPE OF POLICY  \\n\\nThis policy covers the processes, arrangements, and limitations for storing research data during the active research process.  \\n\\nFor the purposes of this policy, research data are as defined by the UKRI Concordat on Open Research Data1 as ‘the evidence that underpins the answer to a research question’. The research data can be quantitative or qualitative and may either be primary (generated first hand) or processed secondary data (building upon primary data) where the rights for the original data may be held elsewhere. Contemporary research data tends to exist digitally and takes many different forms including documents, spreadsheets, code, models, transcripts, images etc. However historic, and visual data can still exist in physical records including books, sketches, photographs, audiotapes, and specimens.  \\n\\nFor a more comprehensive table of research data examples please see Appendix 1.  \\n\\nIf you are engaged in a Knowledge Exchange activity whereby you are generating research data, you are expected to abide by the standards set out within this policy.  \\n\\nResearch data preservation for the purpose of sharing is covered by the Data Preservation and Open Research Data Policy.  \\n\\n#### 2.1 Who is Covered by the Policy  \\n\\nThis policy applies to all researchers (defined as any staff members conducting research and doctoral research students) at Aston University with contractual responsibility for research data generation, collection, and/or analysis, or who produce or use research data. The policy stands to detail the management of that data arising from their research, and the roles of the various individuals or services that will support the management of research data during its lifecycle.  \\n\\nThe policy does not apply to postgraduate taught and undergraduate students in the first instance, except where their research findings are included in published research outputs. They may be guided in the first instance by the principles contained within this policy.  \\n\\n#### 2.2 Ownership of this Policy  \\n\\nResearch Committee owns this policy and oversees research data management policy implementation via College Research Committees.  \\n\\nThe Chair of the Research Committee is responsible for ensuring that this policy is reviewed every two years (unless there is significant change in current regulations which impact this policy) and is fit for purpose.  \\n\\n### 3. POLICY STATEMENT  \\n\\n#### 3.1. General research data management  \\n\\nThe University expects that the following general research data management principles will be followed:  \\n\\nResearch data should be actively managed to ensure that it is available for access, validation, and re-use (where appropriate). The rights and interests of research participants must always be protected. Researchers must comply with all relevant regulations, funder requirements, contractual obligations, and ethical requirements, as appropriate, at all times during their research.  \\n\\n#### 3.2 Research data  \\n\\nResearch data must be:  \\n\\nAccurate, auditable, authentic, and reliable.   \\nIdentifiable, retrievable, and available when needed.   \\nSecure and safe with appropriate measures taken in handling sensitive, classified, and confidential data.   \\nKept in a manner that is compliant with legal obligations, University policy and, where applicable, the requirements of funding bodies; and   \\nConsidered for long term preservation.  \\n\\nClear arrangements for research data management must be in place prior to research data generation. The University recommends that all research projects have an associated Research Data Management plan (RDMP), with named researchers and their responsibilities detailed within. This may be a mandatory requirement as part of a grant application, and your Strategic Funding Manager will advise if so. It is the responsibility of the researcher to consider how legal and ethical restrictions will impact on their ability to share data at the end of the project and it is recommended that these considerations are addressed in a RDMP.  \\n\\nResearch data must be stored and disposed of securely according to the relevant retention and disposal schedule, in accordance with legal, ethical, research funder and collaborator requirements and with particular concern for the confidentiality and security of the data. Records relating to research (e.g. master copies of approved consent forms, information sheets, records relating to ethical approval) should be retained for six years after the date of project closure, in line with the University Records Management Procedures. Research data that underpins published results or is considered to have long-term value should be retained.  \\n\\nResearch data should be stored on Box unless there are specific reasons why this is not practical, nor in line with a collaboration agreement (for example). In this case advice should be sought from Digital Services in the first instance, and the Research Integrity Office where appropriate.  \\n\\nThe deliberate or reckless mismanagement of research data and/or primary materials constitutes unacceptable research conduct and should be reported in line with the University Research Misconduct Policy or the Whistleblowing policy.  \\n\\n#### 3.3 Collaborative research  \\n\\nWhen participating in collaborative projects, an Aston University lead must be identified to take responsibility for management of research data produced under the auspices of Aston  \\n\\nUniversity. This person is also responsible for ensuring that data are managed appropriately and in line with any relevant contracts and/or ethics approvals in place.  \\n\\n#### 3.4 What to do when you leave Aston  \\n\\nThe University expects that researchers will make the necessary arrangements to deposit/archive research data associated with projects which are closed, or transfer/make available data and records which are associated with active research projects. It is expected that transfer will occur via Box, with shared ownership of relevant Box folders with other appropriate researchers within the University, noting that this should be done in line with any relevant contracts and/or ethics approvals in place. For any arrangements where Box cannot be used, Digital Services should be consulted to discuss and approve an alternative mechanism.  \\n\\n### 4. ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES  \\n\\n#### 4.1. University  \\n\\nThe University is responsible for:  \\n\\n4.1.1 Providing access to services and facilities for the storage, backup, deposit and retention of research data and records that allow researchers to meet their requirements under this policy and those of the funders.  \\n\\n4.1.2 ensuring that staff and research students understand the requirements for research data management and engage with training and development as necessary.  \\n\\n4.1.3 Providing the necessary resources to those central services responsible for the provision of these services, facilities, and training.  \\n\\n4.1.4 raising awareness of best practice in research data management in which legal, ethical, and professional requirements and standards are considered whenever research data are created, handled, used, shared or stored.  \\n\\n#### 4.2. Heads of School/Department or Associate Deans for Research  \\n\\nHeads of School/Department or Associate Deans for Research are responsible for:  \\n\\n4.2.1 Ensuring that researchers in their area are aware of this policy and their responsibilities in relation to it.  \\n\\n4.2.2 Assist researchers in their area to meet the requirements of this policy.  \\n\\n4.2.3 Ensuring that when a member of staff leaves the institution before the completion of a project (and final deposit of research data), that a copy of data produced under the auspices of the University is retained.  \\n\\n4.2.4 Oversight of the curation and disposal of research data retained once a member of staff has left or retired from the University.  \\n\\n#### 4.3. Researchers  \\n\\nResearchers are responsible for:  \\n\\n4.3.1 Considering, at the outset of a research project, creation of a RDMP  which documents clear procedures for the collection, storage, use, re-use, access and retention or destruction of the research data.  \\n\\n4.3.2 Familiarising themselves with this policy and associated policies/guidance.  \\n\\n4.3.3 Ensuring that on completion of research, all relevant research data are preserved, maintained, or disposed of appropriately, securely, and can be audited.  \\n\\n4.3.4 Ensuring that requests for destruction/withdrawal of research data by research participants are acted upon in a timely manner.  \\n\\n4.3.5 Ensuring that they meet all requirements in relation to research data placed on their research by funding bodies, regulatory agencies, and research ethics committees, third party data providers and collaborating institutions or under terms of a research contract with the University.  \\n\\n4.3.6 Ensuring that active research data are accessible by another authorised person during the research to guarantee access to the data by the University in case of need.  \\n\\nIn addition, lead researchers or Principal Investigators (including supervisors of doctoral research students, are responsible for:  \\n\\n4.3.7 Ensuring that throughout the project, storing, sharing and manipulation of data are in accordance with legal and ethical requirements and recommended practices to ensure data are kept secure, backed-up and organised effectively (the University recommends that Box is used unless in specific circumstances and with permission from Digital Services).  \\n\\n4.3.8 Ensuring that any requirements in relation to research data and records management placed on their research by funding bodies or regulatory agencies or under the terms of a research contract with the University are also met.  \\n\\nWhere research is undertaken by a student it is the responsibility of the staff member supervising their project to ensure that the student has a clear understanding of appropriate research data management practice in line with this policy.  \\n\\n### 5. EXCEPTIONS TO THIS POLICY  \\n\\nResearch data subject to contractual, regulatory and/or funder policies will need to be managed in line with the stipulated requirements. In this case these requirements supersede the details pertained inside this policy.  \\n\\n### 6. SOURCES OF GUIDANCE  \\n\\nAdvice on how to implement the requirements set out in this policy are available via the Library webpages, Research Integrity webpages or by emailing researchdata@aston.ac.uk or research_governance@aston.ac.uk.  \\n\\n### 7.

This document provides the policy framework through which this effective management can be achieved and audited.  \\n\\n## 1. Purpose & Scope  \\n\\nThe purpose of this policy is to ensure that the University and the University’s staff and students comply with the provisions of the GDPR and the Act and with any other relevant legislation in jurisdictions in which the University operates when processing personal data. Any infringement of the Act will be treated seriously by the University and may be considered under disciplinary procedures.  \\n\\nThis policy applies to staff, students, agents of the University and any authorised processors of personal data held or owned by the University, regardless of where the data is held and, in respect of automatically processed data, the ownership of the equipment used, if the processing is for University purposes.  This policy also applies to personal data retained and processed by Bangor University Students’ Union.  \\n\\n## 2. Data Protection Definitions  \\n\\n### 2.1 Personal data  \\n\\nPersonal data is information that either on its own, or when combined with other information, can identify a living individual. This can include (but is not limited to):  \\n\\nNames, addresses, student and staff ID numbers, dates of birth, photographs, social media handles, video footage and emails.  \\n\\nThe main types of personal data that the University uses are: Staff Data, Student Data (prospective, current and alumni) and Research Data.  \\n\\n### 2.2 Special Category Data  \\n\\nSpecial category data is personal data that needs more protection because it is sensitive. The GDPR defines special category data as:  \\n\\npersonal data revealing racial or ethnic origin;   \\npersonal data revealing political opinions;   \\npersonal data revealing religious or philosophical beliefs;   \\npersonal data revealing trade union membership;   \\ngenetic data;   \\nbiometric data (where used for identification purposes);   \\ndata concerning health;   \\ndata concerning a person’s sex life; and data concerning a person’s sexual orientation.  \\n\\n### 2.3 Processing  \\n\\nData protection legislation refers to the processing of personal data. Processing simply means any use of personal data. This can range from collecting it to sharing it, from amending it to deleting it. The University needs to process information about its employees, its students and other individuals: for example, to allow it to  \\n\\nmonitor performance, achievements and health and safety, and so that staff can be recruited and paid, courses organised and legal obligations (e.g. to funding bodies and the government) fulfilled. Such information must be collected and used fairly, stored safely and not disclosed unlawfully.  \\n\\n## 3. The Principles of Data Protection  \\n\\nThe University is required to adhere to the principles of data protection as laid down by the Act. In accordance with those principles personal data shall be:  \\n\\n1.  Processed fairly, lawfully and in a transparent manner The University must be open and clear about what the personal data will be used for and how it will be used.  \\n\\n2.  Processed for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes The University must ensure that it collects personal data for clear, appropriate and legitimate purposes. Collecting personal data “just in case” for future reference is not compliant with legislation.  \\n\\n3.  Adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the purposes for which they are processed The University must only collect, use or share personal data in a proportionate way. This means that it should collect what it needs to complete its purposes.  \\n\\n4.  Accurate and up to date Personal data must be accurate and up to date. Collecting inaccurate data is a breach of GDPR.  \\n\\n5.  Kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed   \\nPersonal data must only be kept for a specific period of time. This time period will vary depending on what purpose the personal data is collected for - the University’s Record & Data Retention Schedule details how long personal data should be kept for each function.  \\n\\n6.  Processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data  \\n\\nThe University is required to have appropriate technical and organisational measures in place to ensure the security of personal data. This is applicable to both data held electronically and personal data within physical documents.  \\n\\n## 4. The Rights of the Individual  \\n\\nIn addition to the data processing principles, the GDPR also sets out a range of rights individuals can use to understand how their personal data is used or exert an amount of control over how it is used. The rights include:  \\n\\nThe right to be informed An individual has the right to be informed about the collection and use of their personal data.  \\n\\nThe right to access (often called Subject Access Requests)   \\nAn individual has a right to see a copy of the personal data held about them by the University and find out what it is used for. See 6.1 below for further details.  \\n\\nThe right of rectification An individual can request that inaccurate information held about them is either rectified or deleted.  \\n\\nThe right to erasure (also known as the right to be forgotten) An individual may ask for their personal data to be deleted by the University.  \\n\\n### The right to restrict processing  \\n\\nAn individual has the right to request the restriction of suppression of their personal data (i.e. whilst a complaint is being dealt with the University can store the personal data, but not use it).  \\n\\n### The right to data portability  \\n\\nAllows individuals to obtain and reuse their personal data for their own purposes across different organisations.  \\n\\n### The right to object  \\n\\nAn individual has the right to object to the processing of their personal data, for instance to stop their data being used for direct marketing.  \\n\\nRights related to automated decision-making including profiling   \\nAn individual has the right to stop automated decisions being made about them and ask for human intervention instead.  \\n\\n## 5. Responsibilities  \\n\\n### [a] University Responsibilities  \\n\\nThe University is a data controller under the Act and under equivalent legislation in other jurisdictions.  The University is responsible for establishing policies and procedures and providing access to training in order to comply with the requirements of the Act.  \\n\\n#### [i] The Compliance Task Group  \\n\\nThe Compliance Task Group is responsible for the development, implementation, monitoring and review of the University’s Data Protection Policy and associated Procedures. The Compliance Task Group is chaired by the University Secretary and reports to the University Executive who are ultimately responsible for overseeing compliance in this area.  \\n\\n#### [ii] University’s Data Protection Officer  \\n\\nThe Compliance Task Group will nominate an appropriate person as the University's Data Protection Officer, who will be a person of sufficient knowledge and seniority in the University.   \\nThe nominated University Data Protection Officer is the Head of Governance and Compliance in the Governance and Compliance Office.   \\nBangor University has notified the Information Commissioner’s Office that it processes personal data, and queries relating to the University’s notification should be directed to the Data Protection Officer. The University will make arrangements for the identity of the University's Data Protection Officer to be made known to all staff, students, consultants, contractors and volunteers and will also draw to their attention this Policy and associated documentation.   \\nThe Data Protection Officer is tasked with drawing up guidance, giving advice and promoting compliance with this policy in such a way as to ensure the easy, appropriate and timely retrieval of information. The Data Protection Officer (or nominee) has access to all relevant documents relating to a legal compliance request and it is the Data Protection Officer (in consultation with the relevant senior officers) that will make the decisions regarding what information is released or exempted.  \\n\\n### [b] Responsibilities of Pro Vice-Chancellors / Heads of College, Heads of School and Directors of Professional Services  \\n\\nPro Vice-Chancellors / Heads of College, Heads of School and Directors of Professional Services are responsible for ensuring compliance with legislation in relation to personal data and for ensuring that the requirements of this Policy are met.  \\n\\nPro Vice-Chancellors / Heads of College, Heads of School and Directors of Professional Services may choose to delegate the management of, but not the responsibility for, Data Protection matters to a school or departmental Data Protection Co-ordinator. This person will administer and co-ordinate the processes set up within the College, School or Department to manage compliance with data protection legislation and the University’s guidance in this area, and will be a knowledgeable and accessible point of contact for people within the College, School or Department who have questions about data protection issues. Where a Dean, Head or Director chooses to delegate the management of data protection within their College, School or Department the University will provide data protection training which the Data Protection Co-ordinator will be required to undertake.  \\n\\nResponsibility for compliance with the Act’s requirements with regard to personal data on Bangor University alumni has been delegated to the Executive Director of Development & Alumni Services (DAS). Heads of Schools holding and using information on alumni must keep DAS informed about all activities involving former students.  \\n\\nAs part of its internal and external audit programme the University will perform periodic audits to ensure compliance with this Policy and the Act and to ensure that the notification is kept up to date.  \\n\\nPro Vice-Chancellors / Heads of College, Heads of School and Directors of Central Service Departments must ensure that all new members of staff receive an introductory briefing on the Act and that relevant staff members within their areas of responsibility (those dealing with personal and / or sensitive personal data), including any relevant consultants / contractors, receive refresher courses on data protection compliance (available by contacting the Staff Development Unit, Human Resources).  \\n\\n### [c] Staff Responsibilities  \\n\\n[i] When staff members use personal information about students, other members of staff or other individuals they must comply with the requirements of this Policy.   \\n[ii] It is a condition of employment that staff will abide by the rules and policies of the University. Any failure to follow this Policy may result in disciplinary proceedings.  \\n\\nStaff must ensure that:  \\n\\nall personal information entrusted to them in the course of their employment is kept securely.   \\nno personal information is disclosed either verbally or in writing, accidentally or otherwise to any unauthorised third party.   \\nno personal information should be accessed by staff for any reason other than for legitimate University business.   \\nany information that they provide to the University in connection with their own employment is accurate and up to date and that they inform the University of any changes, e.g. changes of address.  \\n\\n[iii] When members of staff are responsible for supervising students doing work which involves the processing of personal information (for example in research projects), they must ensure that those students are aware of the Data Protection Principles as set out in point 3. above, in particular, the requirement to obtain the data subject's freely given, specified, informed and unambiguous consent where appropriate.  \\n\\nA Bangor University student should only use personal data, in relation to their studies, with the knowledge, written agreement and supervision of an appropriate member of staff. This would normally be a postgraduate student’s supervisor, or for an undergraduate student the member of staff responsible for teaching the module. Consideration should also be given to the requirements of the University’s Research Ethics Policy in relation to the use of personal data in research.  \\n\\n[iv] Staff who are unsure about who are the authorised third parties to whom they can legitimately disclose personal data should seek advice from their line manager or the Head of Governance and Compliance.  \\n\\n### [d] Contractors, Short-Term, Casual and Voluntary Staff  \\n\\nThe University is responsible for the use made of personal data by anyone working on its behalf.  Pro ViceChancellors / Heads of College, Heads of School and Directors of Professional Services who employ contractors, short term, casual or voluntary staff must ensure that:  \\n\\nAny personal and / or special category data collected or processed in the course of work undertaken for the University, is kept securely and confidentially. This applies whether the data is an integral part of the work, or whether it is simply contained on media or in places which contractors etc. need to access; it applies whether or not the University explicitly mentions the data in the contract.   \\nAll personal and / or special category data is returned to the University on completion of the work, including any copies that may have been made. Alternatively, that the data is securely destroyed and the University receives notification in this regard from the contractor or short term / voluntary member of staff.   \\nThe University receives details of any disclosure of personal and / or special category data to any other organisation or any person who is not a direct employee of the contractor.   \\nAny personal and / or special category data made available by the University, or collected in the course of the work, is neither stored nor processed outside the UK unless written consent to do so has been received from the Head of Governance and Compliance at the University.   \\nAll practical and reasonable steps are taken to ensure that contractors, short term or voluntary staff do not have access to any personal data beyond what is essential for the work to be carried out properly. The University’s standard data protection clause must be inserted into all relevant University contracts.  \\n\\n## 6. Detailed Policy Requirements  \\n\\n### 6..1. Subject Access Requests  \\n\\nAn individual is entitled to receive from the University:  \\n\\nConfirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning them is being processed, and Where that is the case access to the personal data, and information relating to the purpose of the processing, the categories of personal data being processed, the recipients to whom the personal data has been disclosed, the retention period for the data and the complaints process.  \\n\\nIndividuals wishing to access their own personal data held by the University can do so via a Subject Access Request. Any individual wishing to exercise this right should do so in writing or by email (info-compliance@bangor.ac.uk ) to the Head of Governance and Compliance. A standard form is available on the University’s data protection web pages.  \\n\\nIndividuals will not be entitled to access information to which any of the exemptions in the Act applies. However, only those specific pieces of information to which the exemption applies will be withheld, and information covered by an exemption will be subject to review by the Head of Governance and Compliance  \\n\\nThe University aims to comply with requests for access to personal information as quickly as possible, but will ensure that it is provided within one month as stipulated by the Act and within any relevant time periods set by other jurisdictions.  \\n\\nRequests for access to information held by the University’s Student Counselling service will be dealt with by the Head of Governance and Compliance in consultation with the Head of Counselling.  \\n\\n### 6.2 Consent to process  \\n\\nIt is a condition of the registration of students, and of the employment of staff, that individuals agree to Bangor University’s processing of specified classes of personal data, including special category data.  The University relies on a variety of legal grounds to process information, this includes information required under contract, information which is collected under public task, and information which the University believes it has legitimate interest to process. In some cases, the University needs to process information that, by the definition set out in the GDPR, is classed as special category data. Such information may be needed, for example, to ensure safety, to comply with the requirements of the government or of funding bodies, to provide support for staff or students or to implement institutional policies. In some of these cases, the University may need to seek specific consent from the individual.  \\n\\n### 6.3 Information Collected by the University website  \\n\\nInformation collected on the Bangor University website is owned by Bangor University (including any subsidiary companies).  The University will not sell, share or rent this information to others in ways which differ from what is stated on the University’s website or in any prior agreement. Specific information relating to Bangor University’s website can be found in the University’s Privacy and Cookies Policy.  \\n\\n### 6.4 Data Security Breaches  \\n\\nAny data-related incident or breach or potential breach of the Act, or other equivalent legislation or of the requirements of this Policy should be reported to the Head of Governance and Compliance as soon as possible and, in any case, within 24 hours of discovery.   Incidents will be dealt with in accordance with the University’s Procedures for the Management of a Suspected Data Security Breach.  \\n\\n### 6.5 Sharing of data with third parties  \\n\\nThe sharing of personal and / or special categories data will comply with those details set out in staff contracts and the Data Processing Declarations for staff and students.  \\n\\nStaff, students and others whose personal and / or special categories data may be held by the University, should note that the University has a duty under the Counter-Terrorism and Security Act 2015 to have due regard to the need to prevent people from being drawn into terrorism, and that this duty may involve the passing of information to the police / security services in certain limited cases, overseen by the requirements of the University’s Prevent Policy, and the Information Sharing Agreement between statutory partners in the North Wales area.  \\n\\n### 6.6 Request for Information by Law Enforcement Agencies  \\n\\nThere are exemptions within the Data Protection Act which allow the University, under strict guidelines, to release information to law enforcement agencies without the consent of the individual whose information is being released, and regardless of the purpose for which the information was originally collected.  \\n\\nThe University should respond to all such requests for information in a consistent manner and it therefore operates a Single Point of Contact system for all law enforcement requests which is overseen by the Head of Governance and Compliance.  \\n\\nA detailed procedure outlining how the University deals with such requests is included as Appendix 1 to this Policy.  \\n\\n### 6.7 Request for Information from Statutory Agencies  \\n\\nThe University will seek to respond to requests for information from Statutory Agencies (e.g. Local Authorities) in relation to  \\n\\nA child, young person or vulnerable adult;   \\nProceedings / investigations relating to a child, young person or vulnerable adult.  \\n\\nin a consistent manner.  \\n\\nIn relation to such requests the University will follow the guidelines laid down in the All Wales Child Protection Procedures and also the provisions of Section 115 of the Crime and Disorder Act. Such requests will be considered by the Head of Governance and Compliance on the understanding that the Agency is able to confirm that there is an overriding public interest to justify the disclosure, and in particular the University, in making its decision, will seek to satisfy itself that one or more of the following considerations are relevant:  \\n\\nThe disclosure is necessary for the prevention or detection of crime, prevention of disorder, to protect public safety or protect the rights and freedoms of others; The disclosure is necessary for the protection of young or other vulnerable people The risks posed by the individual The vulnerability of those who may be at risk  The impact of the disclosure on the offender Is the disclosure proportionate to the intended aim Are there equally effective but less intrusive alternative means of achieving the aim Where there is an overriding public interest in favour of disclosure the University will, as set out in Section 1.5.3 of the All Wales Child Protection Procedures require the specific detail of the request, and whether the consent of the individual has been sought and / or given.  \\n\\n### 6.8 Coursework / Examination Marks / Publication of Examination Marks  \\n\\nStudents will be entitled to information about their marks or grades for both coursework and examinations. However, as outlined in Schedule 2, Section 25(3) of the Act, this may take longer than other information to provide where a result has not yet been ratified.  \\n\\nWhen a subject access request is made for examination marks, the University is obliged to respond by the earlier of:  \\n\\n40 days after the announcement of the results OR Five months from the receipt of the request, the fee and all reasonably required information.  \\n\\nUnless students are informed in advance and given the chance to opt out, the publication of exam results in an identifiable format either online or in a publicly accessible area of the University would not be acceptable under the requirements of the Act and this Policy. Students should be informed as early as possible in the academic year what the procedure will be for accessing their examination results.  \\n\\n## 7. Complaints  \\n\\nThe Head of Governance and Compliance will coordinate any complaints received in respect of this policy.  \\n\\nThe complaint should be addressed to the Head of Governance and Compliance in the first instance. The complaint will be acknowledged immediately and every reasonable effort will be made to offer a more comprehensive reply within 21 days.   \\nIf the applicant is not satisfied with the reply then they should inform the Head of Governance and Compliance within 21 days. The complaint will then be forwarded to the University Secretary and will be dealt with in accordance with the University’s Staff & General Complaints Procedure or the University’s Student Complaints Procedure as appropriate.  \\n\\nIf applicants are dissatisfied with the outcome of the Complaints Procedure they may seek an independent review from the Information Commissioner. Requests for review by the Information Commissioner should be mad e in writing to:  \\n\\nThe Information Commissioner, 2nd Floor Churchill House, Churchill Way, Cardiff CF10 2HH Tel: 02920 678 400  \\n\\n## 8.

Related Policies and Procedures  \\n\\nOther relevant University policies include, but are not limited to:  \\n\\nRecords Management Policy   \\nFreedom of Information Policy   \\nInformation Security Policy   \\nProcedures for the Management of a Suspected Data Security Breach   \\nGuidance on the Destruction of Records Containing Confidential Data   \\nPrevent Policy   \\nHigher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) Collection Notices for Students and Staff   \\nCCTV Code of Practice  \\n\\n## Appendix 1  \\n\\n### Disclosure Procedure: Request for Information by Law Enforcement Agencies  \\n\\n### 1. Background  \\n\\nThese Procedures are intended to cover situations where the University receives requests from the Police or other organisations / agencies with law enforcement responsibilities (such as the Department for Work and Pensions, local authorities, HM Customs and Revenue and the UK Visas and Immigration) for personal information about students, staff or other individuals whose information the University holds.  These Procedures also include requests for the provision of any CCTV footage2.  \\n\\nPersonal information held by the University is managed in accordance with the Data Protection Act 2018 (the Act) and the University’s Data Protection Policy3.  The Act and the University’s Policy provide guidance on the circumstances when it is lawful to disclose and transfer personal information outside the University and in general this should be carried out “fairly and lawfully” and in accordance with the University’s Data Protection Notification.  \\n\\nThere are, however, exemptions within the Act which allow the University, under strict guidelines, to release information to law enforcement agencies without the consent of the individual whose information is being released, and regardless of the purpose for which the information was originally collected.  \\n\\nIn particular personal information may be released if:  \\n\\nthe information is required for safeguarding national security failure to provide the information would prejudice the prevention or detection of crime, the apprehension or prosecution of offenders or the assessment or collection of any tax or duty  \\n\\nPersonal information may also be disclosed without contravening the terms of the Act where that disclosure is required by law.  \\n\\nBefore the University releases any information to a law enforcement agency it must satisfy itself that the disclosure is necessary and required for a legitimate purpose.  \\n\\nThe University seeks to co-operate with the police and with other agencies in the prevention and detection of crime and these Procedures set out the steps to be followed when responding to requests for personal information from these external agencies.  \\n\\nThese Procedures should also be considered in conjunction with the University’s Prevent Policy and its Information Sharing Agreement with partners to the Prevent and Channel Programme.  \\n\\n### 2. Requests for Information  \\n\\nIt is important that the University responds to all requests for information in a consistent manner and the University therefore operates a Single Point of Contact system for all law enforcement requests which is overseen by the Head of Governance and Compliance, Governance and Compliance Office.  To facilitate this any member of staff who receives a request for personal information from the Police or any other agency with law enforcement responsibilities must forward it as soon as possible to the Compliance and Records Officer or the Head of Governance and Compliance.  The Head of Governance and Compliance will then ensure that the request is handled in accordance with the remainder of these Guidelines.  Further advice on requests for information from the police or other agencies should be directed to the Head of Governance and Compliance.  \\n\\nStaff should not feel pressurised to disclose information “on the spot”, as it is very rare that the police or agencies require the information urgently (although such circumstances are dealt with in Section 4 below).  \\n\\n### 3. Governance and Compliance Office Procedures  \\n\\n#### [a] Police Requests  \\n\\nAll police forces have standard forms which must be used to request personal information from Bangor University, in accordance with guidance issued by the Association of Chief Police Officers.  The form must certify that the information is required for an investigation concerning national security, the prevention or detection of crime or the apprehension or prosecution of offenders, and that the investigation would be prejudiced by a failure to disclose the information.  All requests from the police, (apart from emergency requests, which are dealt with at section 4. below,) should be received on a data protection form, should clearly state all the information being requested and should be signed and dated by an officer of the rank of Sergeant or above.  \\n\\n#### [b] Other Agencies with Law Enforcement Responsibilities  \\n\\nOther agencies may not routinely use standard forms to submit their requests.  However, any request for personal information should:  \\n\\nBe in writing, on headed paper, and signed by an officer of the agency;   \\nDescribe the nature of the information which is requested;   \\nDescribe the nature of the investigation in broad terms, including citing any relevant statutory authority for requesting the information;   \\nCertify that the information is necessary for the investigation.  \\n\\nOn receipt of such a request the data would normally be disclosed, after due consideration of the University’s legal position to provide such data, by the Head of Governance and Compliance.  \\n\\n### 4. Requests for Disclosure of Information in Emergency Situations  \\n\\nThe University acknowledges that, from time to time and in extraordinary circumstances, police forces, other law enforcement agencies or other emergency services may urgently require personal data from the University and may not be in a position to complete the usual required paperwork at that time.  These requests are usually received by the University’s Security Section but may be received by any member of staff. Requests of this type would include urgent requests for provision of CCTV footage for genuine police operational reasons and / or requests for contact information for members of staff or students.  \\n\\nIn these circumstances, during normal office hours, staff should contact the Compliance and Records Officer or the Head of Governance and Compliance, in the first instance for advice and authorisation before providing any information / CCTV footage.  \\n\\nIf the request is being dealt with out of normal office hours, during University holidays or at a weekend and information or images are required immediately to deal with an ongoing police or other law enforcement incident the procedures outlined below should be followed:  \\n\\n1. The University’s Security Section should note all of the emergency information required, the circumstances of the request and the name, rank and number of the requesting Police Officer.  \\n\\n2. Authorisation and / or advice should then be sought advice from the Campus Services Manager (Security) or Deputy.   \\n3. Where the request isn’t straightforward, or the information isn’t easily located the Campus Services Manager (Security) or Deputy may seek advice from the Head of Governance and Compliance.   \\n4. Once the release of information or images is authorised the Security Team Leader or Assistant should note in the security log the exact circumstances of the request, the name, rank and number of the requesting Police Officer. This information should be forwarded to the Compliance and Records Officer and the Head of Governance and Compliance as soon as practicably possible.   \\n5. If information / images are released in emergency circumstances the Governance and Compliance Team will ensure that the request is followed up with a formal written request from the relevant law enforcement agency, either by supplying a data protection form or a letter on headed paper appropriately authorised.    1\n",
       "# Brunel University Research Data Management Policy  \\n\\nResearchers and the University have obligations to preserve, store and provide access to research outputs, including research data. Demonstrable good practice in research data management and a commitment to data sharing are increasingly required by funding organisations and research partners. There are also benefits for the University and individual researchers: increased research impact and profile; wider benefits for the research community and the public; advancement of knowledge; opportunities for growth.  \\n\\nThe following policy supports the Brunel University Research Data Management Vision, which was approved by Senate in March 2012 and forms part of the University’s research integrity code of practice.  \\n\\n## Vision  \\n\\nResearch data management is the planning, capture, review, publication, storage, preservation and re-use of data produced by research, irrespective of format.  \\n\\nThe University views effective research data management as an essential ingredient of a high quality research culture.   \\nIt assumes that all data produced by University researchers will be made available to the wider academic community, except where the right of individual researchers, or the subjects of the research, would be compromised by such release.   \\nThe University provides training, support, advice and information to support effective research data management.   \\nResearch data management is a shared responsibility. Individual researchers, academic units and central departments work together to develop research data management plans and implement them throughout the research life cycle.   \\nAll research proposals include an integral research data management plan.   \\nThe University actively supports the collection, storage, retention and cataloguing of all its research data (both raw and published) and promotes its re-use by other researchers where appropriate and with due safeguards.   \\nResearch data management policies safeguard the interests of participants in the research, the researchers and the University by facilitating compliance with relevant legislation.   \\nAll research data is stored securely and is registered with the University. Data is stored in the data centres of higher educational institutions or in subject-specific data services.   \\nAll University policies, including those on Intellectual Property, Good Research Practice and the Procedures for Investigation of Research Misconduct, support good practice in research data management.  \\n\\n   \\n\\nThis policy will continue to evolve in line with the changing research environment, in consultation with the research community.  \\n\\n# Policy  \\n\\n## Scope of applicability  \\n\\nResearch data is defined as the evidence base on which academic researchers build their analytic or other work (HEFCE, 2008).  \\n\\nThis policy applies in the first instance to academic staff and postgraduate research students (PGRs). It is expected that data generated by undergraduate (UG), postgraduate taught students (PGTs) and non-academic staff in the normal course of study or administration will normally be exempt from this policy, except where any of the following applies:  \\n\\na. data is generated in connection with an eligible research project, eg funded in whole or in part by Research Councils UK (RCUK), or other public body;   \\nb. the data is generated under a contract of employment with the University, or other agreement (such as a Non-Disclosure/Confidentiality Agreement with a research sponsor / partner;   \\nc. the individual staff member or student has formally published research outputs (conference proceedings, articles, monographs) from the data, in affiliation with Brunel University or jointly-authored with Brunel University staff.  \\n\\nThe terms of this policy will apply in this instance. Staff and students who are uncertain as to whether the policy applies to their situation can contact researchdata@brunel.ac.uk for guidance.  \\n\\n## Managing research data  \\n\\n1. The University will manage research data in accordance with the University's policies, procedures and standards, and statutory and funder requirements.   \\n2. Research data generated by academic staff, students on research degrees, and other staff and students where the research activity falls within the scope of this policy, should be managed in accordance with this policy.  (In this policy the term ‘researcher’ shall refer to all these groups of staff and students.)   \\n3. All researchers are expected to familiarise themselves with the University’s policies and guidance in relation to research integrity, including: Intellectual Property, Good Research Practice, Open Access, Research Data Management, Research Ethics. Researchers are required to manage research data in accordance with these.   \\n4. Heads of Departments, Directors of Research Institutes or equivalent who have overall responsibility for research staff and students must ensure that all research staff and students are aware of the University's research data management and related policies, procedures and guidelines:     \\n5. The Principal Investigator/s or equivalent is responsible for managing compliance with the University and funder research data management policy and requirements during a research project.   \\n6. Researchers are expected to create and maintain data management plans for research where research data may be generated. Where no pro-forma has been specified, researchers may use University data management planning templates available from the Research Support and Development Office (RSDO:    \\n\\n7. The University will develop and provide guidance, training and support regarding research  \\n\\ndata management: researchdata@brunel.ac.uk See also information on the Library website and RSDO ata ownership 8. Researchers should clarify the ownership of any datasets which are used or generated and of derivative IP for all research projects or ventures generated in collaborations or partnerships, at the proposal stage or by the start of a project.  Researchers are invited to seek advice from: researchdata@brunel.ac.uk 9. Where research data is generated wholly by the researcher, data ownership will normally belong to the University and/or the research funder.  Researchers are invited to seek advice at the proposal stage or by the start of a project from: researchdata@brunel.ac.uk 10. Where all the researchers working on a publicly funded research project are from HE institutions, it is expected that institutional policies will be derived from RCUK policy and expectations and will be similar in principle. While the lead institution and Principal Investigator (PI)will have overall responsibility for ensuring that research data is made available appropriately, and will do so in line with the relevant institutional policy, where this is not Brunel, no conflict with University policy is expected. 11. Where research data is generated in cross-sector collaborations or where third party data is used, data ownership and management can be very complex.  Researchers working within cross-sector collaborations with industry partners should pay particular attention to data ownership and derivative IP generated to ensure that as a minimum, data which underpins a research publication they produce may be published or deposited in an open access data archive.  Researchers are invited to seek advice from University research support services and should contact researchdata@brunel.ac.uk in the first instance. 12. Researchers should abide by the conditions set by the data owner/s, in particular relating to data confidentiality and sharing. Where this is in conflict with University and/or funder policy on data sharing, they should seek guidance from RSDO and/or the Library who will advise further. 13. Ownership information for all data generated or modified should be recorded in the metadata or embedded within datasets as appropriate. 14. Where data ownership must be transferred to a third party, researchers must retain sufficient rights to make research data openly available for reuse, unless this contravenes funder requirements or conditions of data owners. 15. Researchers must not give away exclusive rights to publish, reuse or store research data to third parties, unless doing so is a condition of funding (eg for reasons of confidentiality, research  ethics). If so, researchers should seek advice in the first instance. 16. Researchers who leave the University to work at another HEI while a research project is ongoing may generally expect to retain access to datasets for the duration of the project: each case may need individual consideration as to the most appropriate way to achieve this. RCUK policy takes precedence, and data must be made available alongside any research publications which are published in affiliation with the University.  In some instances, it may be appropriate for data to be transferred, such as where the research project will be moving to another institution. Researchers should seek advice from researchdata@brunel.ac.uk.  \\n\\nData storage and sharing   \\n17. Researchers are expected to maintain research data in formats which facilitate data access and sharing.   \\n18. Researchers should create and record sufficient metadata to facilitate the research data discovery and access. The University will develop guidance to help researchers standardise metadata creation and format by data type.   \\n19. All published research outputs will be required to contain sufficient information about how the supporting data can be accessed.   \\n20. Research data may be deposited within appropriate designated storage at the University or an appropriate external data repository or service (eg UK Data Archive, Figshare). Advice should be sought from the research group, funder or the University in case of doubt about what storage facilities might be appropriate.   \\n21. All Brunel University research data must be registered and recorded centrally with the University, irrespective of storage location: research.data@brunel.ac.uk   \\n22. Research data must be retained intact in an appropriate format and storage facility, normally for a period of at least 10 years from the date of any publication which is based upon it. Where specific regulations with regard to data retention apply, eg from funders, these regulations should prevail, particularly where the required retention period is longer than the University requires.   \\n23. The University is committed to preserving and storing research data and will provide advice and/or data storage facilities for data that is not suitable for deposit in an external data repository or service. Initial advice should be sought from research.data@brunel.ac.uk. The minimum period of storage will be (10 years, or as directed by the funder).   \\n24. The University will provide guidance and services for researchers to register data locations centrally to facilitate access to research data.   \\n25. There may be limited periods of privileged use of data for RCUK funded researchers to enable publication of research outputs and ensure appropriate recognition for research teams.  In general, the data which specifically underpins a research publication, should be made available alongside the publication. Publisher embargo periods for research outputs, where not in conflict with RCUK policy on acceptable embargo periods for the discipline, will generally apply.   \\n26. Information on embargo periods by publisher and funder is available from    Additional guidance will be developed by the University as funder policy and requirements continue to evolve, and will be made available from the Library website. These will vary by discipline and Research Council and further guidance will be developed in conjunction with input from researchers.   \\n27. Researchers are required to consider any potential legal, ethical and commercial constraints on the release of research data throughout the research process to ensure that the research process is not damaged by inappropriate data release.   \\n28. Guidance on acceptable timelines for privileged use of data and data release will be developed with researcher input in line with RCUK policy.  \\n\\n29. Guidance on confidential data storage and applicable contractual agreements is provided by RSDO and on open access and confidential data from the Library.  \\n\\nRecommended to Senate by Research and Knowledge Transfer Committee May 2014.

       "# Research Data Policy of the University of Rostock\\n\\n## Preamble\\n\\nQuality-assured research data is a cornerstone of scientific knowledge that can be used on multiple occasions as the basis for further research, irrespective of its original purpose. Sustainable storage and provision of research data therefore not only helps verify earlier results, but is also significantly important for attaining future results with the goal of improving the quality, productivity and competitiveness of science, and forms a fundamental basis for the transfer of knowledge.\\n\\nWith its Research Data Policy, the University of Rostock aims to provide its researchers principles and recommendations for planning, handling, archiving and sustainably publishing research data. The University of Rostock recognises the value of exchanging and publishing data for disseminating research work and publications.\\n\\nWhen acquiring and disseminating scientific findings and managing research data, all members of the university community at the University of Rostock and its associates observe the rules of good scientific practice1. They are required to provide the research data emanating from their research according to the rules or standards that have been established for the respective subject area.\\n\\nPursuant to the University of Rostock's Open Access Declaration2, the University recommends that the research data is made accessible to the public alongside the scientific publications.\\n\\n### Research Data\\n\\nResearch data is all data that is generated using scientific methods during a research project – this applies to newly created as well as previous data that has been adapted for use. Research Data Management (RDM) denotes all activities related to digital research data (not including their actual use), in particular their documentation, storage and long-term availability. These principles are applied to digital research data.\\n\\nThe provision of research data for further use is a service that not only benefits science, but also society as a whole. This additional effort as part of the research activities is recognised and encouraged.\\n\\n### Responsibilities\\n\\nThis policy is aimed at all members of the university community at the University of Rostock and its associates that handle research data, as well as researchers working in Rostock temporarily or as guests. They implement Research Data Management in line with the principles of this policy.\\n\\nResearch Data Management complies with the valid laws to protect individuals and intellectual property and the provisions of the statutes and the university regulations and is subject to specific research funding agreements concluded with third parties. These guidelines apply to research collaborations and research projects, as long as those involved have not stipulated any equivalent or stricter rules.\\n\\n## Handling Research Data\\n\\na. The research data is to be stored in accordance with the FAIR principles of findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability. Open access to research data is usually provided through the citable publication of data.\\n\\nb. Research data that forms the essential foundation for published findings shall be archived in a trustworthy repository, corresponding to the usual customs of the subject area, for at least ten years after the date of publication.\\nc. Research data that cannot be made available as a result of legal and contractual regulations, or due to data protection and other protective reasons, or ethical and legal aspects, will be stored by a confidential storage service that complies with the FAIR principles. A corresponding service is provided by the University of Rostock.\\nd. Access to research data can be temporarily restricted by appropriate embargo periods for a maximum of three years after the end of the project, in order to enable the prior production of corresponding scientific evaluations, publications and theses or dissertations.\\ne. The research data shall be kept securely, processed and documented (details should include the entire research cycle as well as the tools and procedures used) pursuant to established regulations or standards, and stored for the long term.\\nf. Ideally, the corresponding descriptive meta data will be linked to the research data during the research process, or the meta data will be specified in the data management plan.\\ng. It is recommended that research projects involving research data develop and submit a data management plan to the members of staff in the Strategic Research Consulting Unit (S1.1), if possible prior to the start of the research project, especially if university resources are required for Research Data Management.\\nh. The University implements and maintains a basic research data infrastructure and thus ensures appropriate storage and the technical availability of digital research data. Specific requirements must be discussed and, where necessary, financed additionally.\\n\\n### Terms of Access and Use\\n\\na. The rights to use research data are determined by contractual provisions, in particular as a result of employment contracts or through other agreements (e.g. third-party research contracts). Research data (this also includes research data that cannot be protected) must be personally marked and stored under the name of a responsible person.\\nb. The University of Rostock, its members and associates observe ethical, data protection and confidentiality requirements in all tasks related to Research Data Management.\\nc. As far as possible pursuant to the relevant research standards, personal data from individuals whose data is being collected shall be anonymised or, if it helps pseudonymised. They are to be processed and used in accordance with the valid legal regulations. A description of the procedure that is to be agreed with the Data Protection Officer forms the basis for approval pursuant to data protection regulations.\\nd. When transferring subsequent rights of use and publication rights, efforts shall be made to ensure that the data remains available for scientific purposes in accordance with the FAIR principles. An open licence (for research data: Creative Commons) is therefore recommended for simple subsequent use.\\n\\n### Fostering the Development of Competence\\n\\nThe subject-specific methods for Research Data Management shall be appropriately and sustainably anchored in teaching and further education offers, in particular in research-oriented practicals, projects and theses/dissertations.\\n\\nThe English translation of the Forschungsdaten-Policy der Universität Rostock is intended solely as a convenience to non-German-reading students/members of the university. Only the German text published in the University of Rostock’s official bulletin on 23 June 2023 is legally binding. In the event of any conflict between the English and German text, its structure, meaning or interpretation, the German text, its structure, meaning or interpretation shall prevail.\\n\\n## Expiry\\n\\nDue to research progress, the way data is handled is subject to constant change. That is why these principles are evaluated regularly and adjusted to current standards no later than 3 years after their publication3.\\n\\nDrawn up following the decision passed by the Rectorate on 19 June 2023.\\n\\nRostock, 22 June 2023\\n\\nThe Rector of the University of Rostock University Professor Dr. Elizabeth Prommer

       "# Research data management policy of the University of Stuttgart\\n\\nIssued by the Rectorate on 25 July 2017\\n\\n## Policy statement\\n\\nThe ability to reproduce scientific findings and their applications requires that research data be managed responsibly. Capturing and accessing research data thus call for administering discipline-specific standards while also complying with applicable laws and regulations. The University of Stuttgart expects its researchers and cooperation partners to abide by and implement the following research data management protocols to enable the capture and publication of their research data.\\n\\n### Managing research data\\n\\nResearch data come about by being gathered, monitored, calculated, derived or generated during the research process. Even a proprietary piece of software qualifies as research data. Research data management spans the entire life cycle of these data: their generation, analysis, evaluation, publication and storage through to eventual reuse by third parties. Besides documenting the data, it includes specifying – and possibly storing – the equipment and software employed in producing them. Descriptive metadata should be linked to the research data even during the research process. Metadata allows drilling down to the stored research data; hence, it guarantees their reproducibility and reuse.\\n\\n### Protocols\\n\\n1. The researchers who determine within the legal framework when and under which conditions the relevant research data are to be made accessible are responsible for the research data and for complying with discipline-specific standards. The University of Stuttgart promotes and expressly supports free access to research data, provided that ethical, legal, business, and contractual framework conditions are observed.\\n\\n2. Research projects that generate data need careful data management planning and controls on access rights and restrictions, especially if the research data are to be made available to a community. Accordingly, research data management, guided by current professional standards and DFG recommendations on safeguarding good scientific practice, must be documented in a data management plan.\\n\\n3. Research data must be stored securely and appropriately documented and reviewed. In the process, the scientific and legal rights of the researchers, the privacy of personal data, other obligations to third parties (e.g.\\n\\ncooperation partners) and ethical, legal, and business constraints must be upheld. Digital research data are to be saved and stored in a suitable University of Stuttgart information infrastructure using services approved by the University.\\n\\nWith its central facilities, the University of Stuttgart supports researchers in planning, capturing, and retaining research data, in formulating and maintaining standards for handling research data, and with relevant training and consultation offerings created in cooperation with the specialized disciplines. The University of Stuttgart recommends and supports embedding a focus on the importance of discipline-specific, organized research date management in curriculum delivery by the respective faculties.

       "# University policy framework for research data Utrecht University\\n\\n## 1. Structure of this policy framework\\n\\nThis policy framework begins with a definition of research data (section 2). Section 3 looks at the objectives and scope of the framework; specifically, what is this policy framework intended to accomplish and what does fall outside the framework?\\n\\nSection 4 provides an overview of the current rules and regulations on which the framework is based and also describes the general criteria for effective research data management. Section 5 describes the diverse roles involved in research data management and distinguishes their respective responsibilities. Section 6 establishes the period of validity of the framework.\\n\\n## 2. Definitions\\n\\nData are recorded facts or circumstances.\\n\\nResearch data constitute\\n\\nprimary research data: the raw, rough measurements or observations Secondary research data: the results after the data have been processed by a researcher (recoded, combined, categorised, visualised, etc.)\\n\\nExternal research data: research data made available to Utrecht University and having received, for this use, licensed access to use as a source -  but the rights are kept fully outside Utrecht University (such as statistical, financial or survey data).\\n\\nArchivable research data constitute all research data, excluding external research data, deemed relevant to preserve after the research is completed, for example in connection with the verifiability of the research and/or for possible reuse.\\n\\nThis policy framework applies to all research data.\\n\\nResearch data are intrinsically linked to\\n\\nresearch objects (e.g. geological material, blood samples, archival documents)\\ndocumentation of the research process (e.g. in lab (note-) books)\\nresearch results; all inventions, outcomes, materials, methods, processes, products (e.g. publications), programmes, software, findings and/or discoveries generated within the context of a research project\\n\\n## 3. Aims and scope\\n\\n### Aim of this policy framework\\n\\nResearchers at Utrecht University are supposed to be cognisant of the requirements that the university applies to working with research data. This policy is intended to set parameters to safeguard the quality, availability and accessibility of research data within Utrecht University and also to provide a basis for evaluating compliance with laws, regulations and codes of conduct.\\nThe policy clearly delineates responsibilities in terms of the roles to be fulfilled by various parties (Executive Board, faculty boards, support and technical staff, research leaders and individual researchers).\\n\\n### Limits\\n\\nFaculties/research institutes are in charge of the research objects, for which the policy framework makes no provisions.\\nThis policy framework does not define a testing procedure.\\nThe purpose of this policy is not to obligate researchers to work with prescribed tools when preserving and releasing research data. The spectrum of UU research is too diverse to impose general guidelines.\\n\\n## 4. Basic premises and principles\\n\\nThis policy framework is premised on existing frameworks, which include (but are not limited to):\\n\\nthe Dutch Personal Data Protection Act the Dutch Copyright Act and the Patents Act • Medical-ethical research protocol requirements pursuant to the Dutch Medical Research (Human Subjects) Act (WMO), as evaluated by the Medical Research Ethics Committee (METC) Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities Code of Conduct of the Association of Universities in the Netherlands (VSNU) Utrecht University's information security policy and ground rules\\n\\nIn addition to the above, Utrecht University applies the following specific principles to data management.\\n\\n### Creation and collection\\n\\nResearch data must be collected, registered, selected and made available for use in accordance with the applicable international standards.\\n\\n### Storage, management and retention\\n\\nAll research data are to be managed in accordance with the university's requirements\\ngoverning information security, privacy protection and transparency, in this order of\\nimportance.\\nArchived research data are to be retained for a minimum of ten years, commencing from the date that the research results are published.\\nThe data are to be stored safely, protected from unauthorised use and loss.\\nThe party or parties holding the rights to the data and the parties entitled to use the data are clearly and visibly documented.\\nArchived research data are to be stored in a structure that is suitable for long-term preservation and later consultation.\\nThe full set of research data connected with a research project are to be retained upon its conclusion insofar as relevant for the verifiability of the research.\\nThe research data will be provided with metadata to describe the data with sufficient clarity to ensure they are findable for further research.\\nThe retention period and contact details of the data manager are clearly and visibly\\ndocumented. If research data are to be destroyed, this has to be done in a manner that is verifiable and is irrevocable.\\n\\n### Findability and access\\n\\nDigital research should be easy and quick to find\\n\\nAccess needs to be furnished in a user-friendly as possible environment in a manner that duly credits and also protects the rights of those who collected or created the data and also protects the rights of those have a legal interest in the manner in which the data are made accessible and used. Archived research data are to be made available for access and reuse at and outside Utrecht University insofar as is reasonably possible and subject to the proper precautionary measures. Exclusive rights to reuse or publish research data are not to be transferred to commercial publishers or their representatives without retention of the right to provide open access to the data for the purpose of reuse, except where such transfer is a condition for awarding funds.\\n\\n## 5. Roles and responsibilities\\n\\nUtrecht University distinguishes between the following individual or (groups of) actors, each bearing specific responsibilities for data management.\\n\\n1. The creators of the data: researchers and students and their supervisors have primary responsibility for data care.\\n2. Research institute directors are responsible for ensuring that students, researchers and research leaders at their institute abide by the university policy framework and any supplementary faculty regulations. They may also establish further guidelines as needed.\\n3. Deans draw up additional faculty guidelines pursuant to the university policy framework and are responsible for ensuring that research institute directors implement both the university policy framework and the faculty guidelines.\\n4. The Executive Board is responsible for the preparation of a general university policy framework, and for monitoring and facilitating its implementation through the provision of infrastructure, information and other forms of support.\\n\\nA further general guiding principle is that each and every staff member must act as a good steward in the management of relevant data.\\n\\n### 1. Researchers\\n\\nIt is the responsibility of each individual researcher (or, in the case of a group of researchers, the research leader) to draw up a Data Management Plan (DMP) at the start of the research project and to follow up the agreements made in this plan. The DMP specifies the manner in which research data may be collected, stored, preserved, managed, documented and used. A sample DMP template is available on the Utrecht University intranet.\\n\\nMore specifically,\\n\\nResearchers are obliged to:\\n\\ndraw up proper procedures and design processes for the collection, storage, use, reuse, availability and long-term archiving of and provision of access to research data within the research programme. In the case of external data, agreements must be made with the provider of the external data;\\nif participating in a joint study or research project to make and record the made agreements on data management;\\nensure that the integrity, confidentiality and protection of the data are guaranteed;\\nwhere the data fall under the Dutch Personal Data Protection Act or under the European Data Protection Guideline, to be aware of their obligations and possible statutory liability;\\nmake arrangements for the continued operational management of the research data at the end of the research project or termination of their employment contract at the institution;\\nfactor in the costs for the preservation and management of the research data in research proposals and grant applications.\\n\\n### 2. Lecturers and student/PhD supervisors\\n\\nIt is crucial that young researchers (students and PhD candidates) develop an awareness of the importance of good data management and learn about the various options that the institution offers for this purpose. Their supervisors play a key role in developing this awareness. This means that lecturers and those supervising students and PhD candidates are responsible for acquainting their students or PhDs with the university frameworks and disciplinary guidelines governing the collection, storage, preservation, protection and use of data. They must further monitor that students and PhD candidates follow these frameworks and guidelines when conducting their research. It is the joint responsibility of students/PhD candidates and their supervisors to make and record proper agreements on data management and use.\\n\\n### 3. Students/PhD candidates\\n\\nStudents are expected to familiarise themselves with the university and faculty policy frameworks and other guidelines applicable to their research and for collecting, storing, preserving, securing and using data in accordance with those frameworks and guidelines.\\n4. Faculty research institute directors\\n\\nFaculty research institute directors are responsible for ensuring meticulous research, which also includes conscientious data management. They must ensure that staff and students are aware of their responsibilities and obligations in regard to data management and provide education and training to address any gaps in data management knowledge and skills.\\n\\nMore specifically,\\n\\n### Faculty research institute directors must:\\n\\nauthorise the procedures that their researchers, students and PhD candidates follow for the collection, storage, use, reuse and (if necessary) deletion of research data;\\nensure that researchers are aware of all their responsibilities and obligations in relation to the research data they collect in the course of their research and that they are sufficiently equipped to fulfil these responsibilities and obligations;\\ndetermine additional guidelines for the storage and long-term preservation of research data at their institute, if desired, which are consistent with guidelines of the faculty, the university policy framework and statutory requirements, and ensure compliance with these additional guidelines.\\n\\n## 5. Deans\\n\\nFaculty deans are responsible for the implementation and monitoring of the university policy framework and for drawing up additional faculty guidelines to this end if needed; Deans are responsible for the meticulous handling and management of data within their respective faculties, in conformity with all statutory and other applicable requirements.\\n\\n6. The Executive Board\\n\\nThe Executive Board is responsible for the preparation and adoption of a university policy framework governing research data (in the form of the Utrecht University Research Data Policy);\\nThe Executive Board is responsible for maintaining and updating the research data policy framework;\\nThe Executive Board supervises the implementation of the university research data policy framework;\\nThe Executive Board makes provisions for institutional education, training, support, advisement and, where necessary, the development of guidelines and templates, in any case including a Data Management Plan template;\\nThe Executive Board ensures that the institution has facilities and services enabling the secure storage of research data for current and future use. This includes storage, backup, registration, repository and long-term preservation services for datasets and the infrastructure needed to provide access to research data and share it with third parties.\\n\\n## 2. Period of validity of the policy framework\\n\\nThis policy framework takes effect on 1 January 2016 and is valid until a new version is issued.\\n\\nDisclaimer:  This document contains an unofficial translation into the English language.

It seeks to protect the dignity, rights, and welfare of all those involved in the research it produces. The University recognises its duty to safeguard the confidentiality of personal research data in keeping with its responsibilities under the Data Protection Act 2018 and the General Data Protection Regulation 2018 (UK GDPR). This legislation defines the University's responsibility to ensure appropriate organisational and technical measures are in place to protect personal data.\\n\\nAny research project collecting data from a human participant or collecting or processing personal data must have formal ethical approval from the University and comply with the University's Data Protection and Data Disposal Policy.\\n\\nThe University recognises research data as a valued asset. It identifies the maintenance of accurate and retrievable data from the research community as best practice, acknowledging that sharing research data is crucial to the impact, visibility, transparency, trust, and knowledge transfer of the University's research.\\n\\nWrexham University supports the UKRI Common Principles on Research Data, acknowledging that publicly funded research data are a public good, produced in the public interest for societal benefit and, where possible, be made openly available with a few restrictions as possible in a timely and responsible manner.\\n\\n## Purpose\\n\\nThis Policy sets out the principles that should be followed by staff and students at Wrexham University when processing research data throughout the research lifecycle. The Policy promotes good practice in research data management, fostering responsibility for preparing Research Data Plans and ensuring research data is stored, retained, accessed, and disposed of securely, complying with legal and ethical obligations, University policy and, where applicable, the requirements of funding bodies.\\n\\nThe Policy defines the individual and institutional responsibilities that the individual and institutional levels that should guide the work of those involved in research data collection, curation, storage, and maintenance. It sets out the basis on which University staff and students will process any personal data collected from data subjects in the course of conducting research or that is provided to those conducting research by data subjects or other sources for the same.\\n\\n## Scope\\n\\nThis Policy applies to all staff and students at Wrexham University engaged in research, whether or not the research is funded and whether or not the data collected includes collecting or processing personal data. The Policy covers all data collected during a research study and all members of the University involved in the creation, collection, and curation of research data under the auspices of the University, including sessional, visiting or emeritus, associates, honorary, contractors, consultants, or volunteers.\\n\\n# Prifysgol Wrecsam Wrexham University\\n\\n## Definitions\\n\\nFor the purpose of this Policy, research data are defined as that which is collected, observed, or created for the purpose of analysing and producing original research results. Such research data are the recorded information, regardless of the form or the media in which they may exist, necessary to support or validate a research project's observations, findings or outputs. In practice, the nature of research data can vary widely depending on the discipline. It can be textual, numerical, qualitative, quantitative, final, preliminary, physical, digital or print. Research data comes in many formats, including word-processed documents, PDFs, spreadsheets, scanned lab books, online surveys, digital recordings, databases or computer software.\\n\\n## Principles\\n\\n### Collection\\n\\nResearch data must be collected responsibly, using the correct methods and techniques to protect the integrity of your data.  Research data must be collected in accordance with the ethical approval of a research project and the legal obligations of the Data Protection Act 2018.\\n\\n### Ownership\\n\\nFor research carried out under a grant or contract or involving collaboration with another institution or external party, the agreement's terms will determine the data's ownership and rights. It is recommended that any contract with an external party identify the process for Research Data Management in conjunction with the principles of this Policy.\\n\\nWhere no external contract and no intellectual property rights exist, the University owns the data generated during research undertaken under the auspices of the University by staff members in its employment and postgraduate research students. Where taught students generate data under the supervision of a staff member as part of a funded project the data will be owned by the University or in accordance with the terms of the contract.\\n\\n### Organisation and Technical Measures\\n\\nThe University Research Ethics Policy sets out the ethical review and approval process to ensure that the University research is carried out in the public interest and is lawful under the UK GDPR and Data Protection Act. All staff and students conducting research within the scope of the Research Ethics Policy must seek ethical approval before data collection and processing commence.\\n\\nData Management Plans and Data Protection Impact Assessments\\n\\nData Management Plans (DMP) should be completed before the commencement of all research projects. The DMP should address the type, volume, storage, confidentiality, retention, sharing, deposit, reuse, and integrity of the data throughout the project lifecycle. The Principal Investigator or Supervisor is responsible for creating and owning\\n\\n# Prifysgol Wrecsam Wrexham University\\n\\na research data management plan and ensuring the full research team and collaborators are aware of and adhere to it.\\n\\nMany funders require researchers to submit a data management plan as part of the application process. Researchers should respect the data management policies of the funder(s) and other external parties. Many public funders of research, including all the UK Research Councils, accept that the management of research data is a legitimate research expense.\\n\\nResearch projects requiring ethical approval should use the data management plan provided in the online ethical approval application form. Projects not requiring ethical approval should complete the Wrexham University Data Management Plan Template. When preparing an application, researchers applying for funding should consider the terms and requirements listed in the funder policy documents. Researchers can access DMPOnline to view the data management plan templates based on the requirements listed in the funder policy documents.\\n\\nThe UK GDPR creates a legal obligation to think about and mitigate data protection issues and privacy concerns at the project planning stage before any data is gathered. A Date Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) is an assessment to help researchers identify any potential risks a project might have as regards intruding into participants' privacy. The DPIA then assists with implementing appropriate measures and controls to minimise and manage those risks. The legislation has made DPIAs mandatory for higher-risk data processing to ensure that privacy and data protection are key considerations from the start of any project and then taken into account throughout the project's lifecycle.\\n\\nThe European Commission (DG Research and Innovation) recommends that a DPIA be carried out for data processing operations that may entail higher ethical risks, such as:\\n\\n<html><body><table><tr><td>TypesofPersonal Data</td><td>Racial or ethnic origin Political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs Genetic, biometric or health data Sex Life or sexual orientation Trade Union membership</td></tr><tr><td>Data Subjects</td><td>Children Vulnerable people People who have not given their explicit consent to participate in the project</td></tr><tr><td>Scale or complexity of data Processing</td><td>Large scale processing of personal data Systematic monitoring of a publicly accessible area on alarge scale Involvementofmultipledatasetsand/orservice providers orthecombination and analysisofdifferent datasets (big data)</td></tr><tr><td>Data-collection or processing Techniques</td><td>Privacy-invasive methods ortechnologies (the covert observation, surveillance, tracking or deception of individuals) Using camera systems to monitor behaviour or record sensitive information.</td></tr></table></body></html>\\n\\n# Prifysgol Wrecsam Wrexham University\\n\\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Data mining (including data collected from social media networks)web crawling orsocial network analysis.

However, some funders will require a separate DPIA, which should be completed using the University Data Protection Impact Assessment Template or one provided by the funder if that is specified. In cases where a research project does not require ethical review, researchers must still complete a DPIA screening and, if necessary, a full assessment, which must be authorised by the Data Protection Officer.\\n\\nThe University mandates that a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) is completed prior to the commencement of a research project that is likely to result in high risk to individuals. The DPIA process is a legal requirement and an important tool to help you identify and minimise the data protection risks of a project involving personal data processing. Researchers should refer to the ICO for further information on the definition of high-risk data processing and the Wrexham University Data Protection Impact Assessment template and guidance document.\\n\\n## Storage\\n\\nAll research data must be stored in a university-managed environment throughout the project's lifecycle. A university approved environment protects research data against a data breach, data loss and corruption, and unauthorised access and guarantees the security and integrity of research data and participant information. The University recommends that research data collected by staff or students be stored on the University's private drive (Z drive), shared drive (Y drive), or cloud-based University (Teams and OneDrive). Physical research data should be stored on the University premises in a secure environment at all times. Researcher working remotely should refer to the principles and guidance outlined in the University Remote and Mobile Working Policy\\n\\n## Data Sharing\\n\\nWhere proposed research projects involve collaboration with third parties (e.g another university, NHS Trust or other external partners) and the sharing of personal data, special category data, criminal convictions or offences data or pseudonymised data is anticipated, an appropriate contract or data sharing agreement must be put in place before any data is exchanged.\\n\\n# Prifysgol Wrecsam Wrexham University\\n\\nData Sharing Agreements set out the framework for the sharing of personal data and documents, the purpose of the sharing, covers what happens to the data at each stage and puts in place standards that help all the parties involved in the sharing to be clear about their roles and responsibilities.\\n\\nA ‘Data Sharing Agreement' is required where the University and the other party are both Data Controllers or Joint Controllers and intend on sharing personal information routinely and regularly between themselves.\\nA 'Data Processing Agreement' is required when the University is the data controller and contracts an outside company to undertake a task that involves the processing of personal data on its behalf.\\n\\nTransferring Data Outside the EU\\n\\nThe UK GDPR does not allow the transfer of personal data outside the EU or a country without adequate protection without meeting a condition like explicit consent or a binding contract. Researchers must always, therefore, obtain explicit consent or anonymise data before sending data outside the European Economic Area (the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein). Some countries listed by the EU have received adequacy decisions (as of January 2021, these are Andorra, Argentina, Canada, Faroe Islands, Guernsey, Israel, Isle of Man, Japan, Jersey, New Zealand, Republic of Korea, Switzerland, United Kingdom, Uruguay but the list may change with time).\\n\\nThe UK is currently considered adequate for data protection purposes until 2025. In all cases, researchers should use password protection or encryption where possible in transit, but bear in mind that some countries will require the use of encryption keys if personal data are transferred to them.\\n\\n## Retention\\n\\nFunded research projects must comply with any retention periods specified by the funder requirements. Where a funder does not specify a retention period or a project is unfunded, research data generated by a member staff should be held for a minimum of 10 years from the point of collecting, creating, or generating the research data, where appropriate to do so. The University requires that data directly underpinning any published findings is stored for a minimum of this time frame to support or validate a research project's observations, findings, or outputs.\\n\\nResearch data collected by Wrexham University students should be retained up to the point of the assessment period. Research data collected by students at the University to support a potential publication in the future should be retained for 10 years. It is the supervisor's responsibility to ensure any personal research data collected by students has been deleted and that any retained data is stored appropriately.\\n\\nWhere appropriate, research data must be offered and assessed for deposit and retention in a national or international data service or subject repository.\\n\\n# Prifysgol Wrecsam Wrexham University\\n\\nIndividual Research Councils' and other funders' data policies and good research practice guidance provide additional requirements and should be consulted, as well as retention periods specified in each Research Data Management Plan. In many instances, researchers will resolve to retain research data and records for a longer period than the minimum requirement. Researchers should note that personal data can be kept in non-anonymised form for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed.\\n\\n## Disposal\\n\\nThe disposal and destruction of research data must be undertaken in accordance with the University's Data Protection and Data Disposal Policy. The agreed data disposal time and process should be included in the Data Management Plan and any participant-facing documents. If data have been shared with partners or transferred to third parties in the course of the project, researchers should ensure that they have deleted them unless they have a legitimate basis for retaining them.\\n\\n## Access\\n\\nWrexham University recognises the benefits of making Research Data accessible to the public and broader academic community.\\n\\nAccess to research data during the course of a research project should be restricted to the collaborators of the research project or provided access when the correct data-sharing approvals are in place.\\n\\nAccess to research data after a research project has finished should be considered in relation to the ownership, ethical, confidential, sensitive, commercial, legal, regulatory or funding restrictions. Research Data produced by Wrexham University staff should be openly available with as few restrictions as possible where appropriate. Personal research data may be made available if it is in an anonymised form and where there is informed consent for it to be shared.\\n\\nThe University recommends that data sets are assigned a persistent identifier, such as a Digital Object Identifier (DOI). The use of ORCID (Open Researcher and Contributor ID), as well as the use of standard open licences for sharing research data is also recommended. Authors of restricted data sets should also consider their deposit in a trusted repository to aid discovery, meet funder requirements and ensure the data remains available to fulfil legitimate access requests.\\n\\n## FAIR Data\\n\\nWhere it is lawful to do so, the University supports the broad global consensus that publicly funded research data should be made openly available as soon as possible with as few restrictions as necessary. Additionally, many UK and international funders have embraced FAIR principles for data sharing, making data.\\n\\nFindable Accessible Interoperable Reusable\\n\\nUK Research and Innovation (UKRI) for example have agreed a set of common principles for research data policies, which are based on the expectations that:\\n\\n# Prifysgol Wrecsam Wrexham University\\n\\nPublicly funded research data are a public good and produced in the public interest.\\nDatra that has acknowledged long-term value should be preserved to remain accessible and usable for future research.\\nPublished results should always include information about how to access the supporting data.\\nSuch research data should be made openly available with as few restrictions as possible in a timely and responsible manner.\\n\\n## Reporting a Data Incident/Breach\\n\\nThe UK GDPR requires Data Controllers to notify any Personal Data Breach to the Information Commissioner and, in certain instances, the Data Subject. The University has put in place procedures to deal with any suspected Personal Data Breach and will notify Data Subjects and/or the Information Commissioner where we are legally required to do so. All breaches should be reported immediately to the Data Protection Officer. Researchers should preserve all evidence relating to the potential Personal Data Incident/Breach to enable the DPO to carry out an investigation. All research data incident, breach or loss must also be reported to the Research Office.\\n\\n## Other Polices, Procedures, Legislation\\n\\nThis Policy should be read with reference to the

Open access publishing of research data aims to make research data easily discoverable, assessable, intelligible, usable and interoperable. Where applicable, these requirements can also be applied to data other than open access published research data, and to the software needed to handle the open data. The decisions to publish software, other than the software explicitly needed to handle the data, are done using the same conscious and strategic grounds as opening of the research data.',\n",

       " 'The maintenance of accurate and retrievable data arising from research projects is an essential component of good practice in the conduct of research and a key component of research integrity and research reproducibility. Consideration around research data management and evidence of good research data management should be seen as an integral part of the research process, which is what Aston University expects of all researchers. This is in line with Aston’s values and commitment to deliver research that changes lives for the better through collaborations between students, academic staff and industry leaders.',\n",
       " 'In addition, good research data management can benefit the transparency, productivity and overall reliability of the research generated, supporting the research process and visibility of any research outputs. Evidence of good research data management is also a requirement of most funding bodies and publishers of journal articles. Aston University is committed to supporting its researchers to meet the highest standards of research data management and acknowledges that research data management involves numerous stakeholders across the research data lifecycle, from creation through to dissemination and preservation. Therefore, this policy is divided into distinct sections aimed at key stakeholders within the University.',\n",

       " 'For the purposes of this policy, research data are as defined by the UKRI Concordat on Open Research Data1 as ‘the evidence that underpins the answer to a research question’. The research data can be quantitative or qualitative and may either be primary (generated first hand) or processed secondary data (building upon primary data) where the rights for the original data may be held elsewhere. Contemporary research data tends to exist digitally and takes many different forms including documents, spreadsheets, code, models, transcripts, images etc. However historic, and visual data can still exist in physical records including books, sketches, photographs, audiotapes, and specimens.',\n",
       " 'For a more comprehensive table of research data examples please see Appendix 1.',\n",

Ownership information for all data generated or modified should be recorded in the metadata or embedded within datasets as appropriate. 14.

       " 'Data, records, and sample related information are fundamental to both high quality research and academic integrity: to verify and defend the process and outcomes of research, accurate and retrievable research data are essential. Increasing amounts of collected and produced raw data, as well as processed data, need to be retained in order to exploit their long-term value for research, teaching, and for wider exploitation for the public good.',\n",
       " 'The purpose of data management is to maximise the academic value of research data by ensuring that such data is managed according to good practices for collection, curation, storage, management, retrieval, re-use, sharing, archiving, and access, appropriate for the data and discipline concerned.',\n",

       " 'Research data should be managed in accordance with the above principles and requirements. The principal investigator of a project is responsible for the data life-cycle. • Clear procedures for the collection, storage, use, re-use, access and retention of the research data should be developed and documented. This information should be incorporated, where appropriate, in a research data management plan (DMP). Such DMP should describe how the collection of data and metadata will be integrated into everyday research processes, so as to make compliance with the DMP as simple as possible. Researchers should plan the ongoing storage of their research data after the completion of the research as to how and where such data will be stored. Appropriate long-term archives include national or international subject-specific archives or a managed university repository.',\n",
       " 'Requirements concerning research data on the part of funding bodies must be met. This includes compliance with publication-ban, -restrictions, or -duty imposed by external contracting bodies, administrative regulations, and federal laws.',\n",

       " 'The ICBM provides researchers with access to training, support, and advice on data management.',\n",
       " 'The ICBM provides access to services and facilities for the storage, backup, and deposit of research data.',\n",
       " '• The ICBM will build and maintain a central catalogue of metadata descriptions for indexing, archiving, naming, and retrieval of datasets.',\n",
       " 'Acknowledging that this is an aspirational policy, the ICBM intends that an evolutionary approach will be taken to fully implement this policy and related initiatives over a number of years. To this end, the ICBM establishes a data management team, which will organise, develop, and implement all necessary measures to fulfil the obligations of the ICBM.',\n",

Such issues need to be considered in the design and conduct of research and procedures must be adopted to minimize any risk to researchers. In addition, researchers must consult all appropriate health and safety guidelines and procedures relevant to their area of research before commencing work.',\n",

       " '4.1 Researchers have a responsibility to protect participants from any harm arising from research. Harm to participants may arise from undue stress through participation, loss of self esteem, psychological injury as well as physical harm. As a general rule, people participating in research must not be exposed to risks that are greater than or additional to those they encounter in their normal lifestyles.',\n",

       " '5.1.3 Giving and obtaining consent can be a process, not always a one-off event and participants have the right to change their minds and withdraw consent at any time. However, if the withdrawal of consent occurs at the time when it affects the possibility of the finalization of the research (for instance, shortly before publication or thesis defense), the withdrawal should result only in the deletion of all personally identifiable data of the participant both in published materials and in stored and processed research data. If a researcher doubts whether a person participating in research still consents to participating s/he must clarify this with the person in question.',\n",

Children’s capacity to consent to research depends on their understanding of the research to be undertaken. Where information about the research and study can be given clearly and simply, it is possible for quite young children to consent to take part in research.\",\n",
       " '5.4.4 For a child to give valid consent they would need to understand the nature of the engagement with the researcher and understand that it is different to other interactions with those who may seek information from the child. Particularly, the child must be able to understand that the researcher is not able to make decisions about their life, and will use the information the child provides, but not in a way which would allow others to identify the child.',\n",
       " '5.4.5 Where a researcher wishes to include children in a study whom he/she considers is not mature enough to decide about participation he/she must obtain the agreement of at least one person who has parental responsibility for the child before engaging them in any research activity.',\n",

There are however two areas of concern where the same level of confidentially cannot be promised to a child: where a child discloses that they are being seriously harmed or ill-treated, or where the researcher discovers a condition about which the parents could take action to benefit the child. In these instances researchers could be seen to have a duty of care to disclose such information to relevant third parties.',\n",
       " '5.4.7 In the case of research in educational settings, any special school policies or procedures must be followed and efforts made to fully inform those responsible for children in these settings of the purpose and benefits of any proposed research with children.',\n",

In such group based, participatory research activities the usual effort should be made to ensure that the group leader(s), or others in positions of responsibility, as well as other individuals of a group, are made aware that they participate in their activities with research purposes. If this \"open strategy\" is not pursued, the researcher must be able to make an explicit and convincing case why this was not done.',\n",
       " '5.5.3 It is recognized that in certain types of observational research or organizational settings it may be more difficult to explain to people participating their right to withdraw at any stage.

       " '5.6.1 In certain research disciplines (e.g. psychology), to ensure the viability of a piece of research, it is sometimes necessary to withhold information on the true objectives of the research from the people participating in it. In such types of research it is impossible to obtain informed consent from the participants. Wherever possible such research should be avoided and the Ethical Research Committee will pay particular attention to research involving deception. Where deception or the misleading of participants is considered necessary, the central principle to consider when deciding the ethical soundness of deception is the anticipated reaction of the participant once debriefed. If it is likely that the participant will be angry, or show unease once debriefed the research is likely to be deemed unacceptable.',\n",
       " '5.6.2 However, when such research, requiring consent but not informed consent from participants, is judged to be necessary for the results of the research to be valid, researchers must exercise particular caution. In such circumstances the lead researcher has a special responsibility to: (i) Justify that alternative procedures to avoid the withholding of information or deliberate deception are not available and, if available, are not feasible for the research; (ii) Justify why the withholding of information, or an element of concealment or deception, is integral to the viability of the research.',\n",

Researchers must be aware of the risks to anonymity, confidentiality and privacy posed by all kinds of personal information storage and processing which directly identify a person (e.g. audio and videotapes, electronic and paper-based files, e-mail records). 3 Measures to prevent accidental breaches of confidentiality must be taken, and in cases where confidentiality is threatened, relevant records should be destroyed. Provisions for data security at the end of a project must be made.',\n",

       " '## INTRODUCTION',\n",
       " '1. De Montfort University is committed to research excellence and integrity and seeks to promote high standards of research data management throughout the research data lifecycle.  The University is working towards compliance with the principles of the UK Concordat on Open Research Data and believes that making data ‘as open as possible, as closed as necessary’ (European Commission FAIR Data Guidelines 2016) is key to research transparency, integrity and engagement.',\n",
       " '2. This document sets out our policy on Open Research Data and on the management of data in the research lifecycle in accordance with funder requirements, and supersedes and replaces DMU’s ‘Guidelines for Managing Research Data’. It should be read alongside the following policies:',\n",
       " 'Guidelines for Good Research Practice Policy on Conducting Sensitive Research Data Protection DMU Figshare Terms & Conditions Faculty-specific Guidelines for Research Ethics',\n",
       " '## SCOPE',\n",
       " '3. This policy applies to all DMU staff who undertake academic research, as well as postgraduate research students, external consultants, visitors and contractors conducting research at or on behalf of the University (collectively referred to as ‘DMU researchers’), whether externally funded or not, unless otherwise indicated.',\n",
       " '4. The term ‘research data’ refers to the evidence that underpins the answer to the research question and can be used to validate findings, regardless of its form (e.g. print, digital or physical).  These might include quantitative information or qualitative statements collected by researchers in the course of their work by experimentation, observation, modelling, interview or other methods, or information derived from existing evidence. They may include (but are not limited to) statistics, collections of digital images, sound recordings, transcripts of interviews, survey data, fieldwork notes, artwork, archives, found objects, published texts or manuscripts.  The primary purpose of research data is to provide the information necessary to support or validate a research project’s observations, findings or outputs (Concordat on Open Research Data, 2016).',\n",
       " '5. Open research data are those research data that can be freely accessed, used, modified and shared, provided that there is appropriate acknowledgement, where required (Concordat on Open Research Data, 2016).',\n",
       " '6. All research data created by DMU researchers are the intellectual property of the University, unless subject to a grant, contract or other legally binding agreement signed by the University that stipulates otherwise.  For the avoidance of doubt, where legislative requirements apply, those legislative requirements will take precedence over this policy.',\n",
       " '7. All new research proposals for external funding must include research data management plans or protocols (DMPs) in line with the relevant funders’ policies (bearing in mind that some funders may require a DMP to be in place even if they do not ask for it to be submitted to them).  DMPs are also encouraged for research that is not externally funded, in order to enable cross-checking and validation, and support research integrity.  Additionally, it may be the case that individual Faculty Ethics Committees might require a DMP to be submitted with ethics applications.',\n",
       " '8. All DMPs should include responsibilities for data collection, documentation and metadata, ethical and legal compliance, storage and backup, selection of data of long-term value, preservation and data sharing.',\n",
       " '9. DMPs should ensure that research data are available for access and re-use wherever appropriate and with appropriate safeguards. For example, where the openness of data is restricted as outlined in sections 16 and 17, it may be that metadata is still made available and data sharing for re-use agreed with specific individuals/organisations under an appropriate legal agreement such as a data sharing agreement or a non-disclosure agreement. This would need to be detailed in the DMP.',\n",
       " '10. All research data of continuing value to the researcher and/or wider research community, or specified by funding bodies or publishers, or required for legal or other regulatory purposes, must be made openly available unless restrictions apply (see sections 16 and 17).',\n",
       " 'a. In the case of digital data, this may be achieved by depositing data to a specific domain repository (see section 11 below), or to the University data repository at',\n",
       " \"b. In the case of non-digital data, this may be achieved by digitising the data and treating it as digital data, or by storing the data, e.g. with DMU Library Special Collections (the University's archive service) and recording the metadata on the University data repository at   including details of how to access the data.\",\n",
       " '11.It is recognised that the most appropriate location for making data open may be a specific domain repository.  This may be because a funder requires it (e.g. UK Data Service for ESRC-funded research), or because it is the most appropriate for a particular discipline (e.g. Archaeology Data Service).  Data should be deposited in the most appropriate repository, and metadata recorded and made openly available via the University data repository at',\n",
       " '12. To enable research data to be discoverable and effectively re-used by others, sufficient metadata should be recorded and made openly available via the University data repository (',\n",
       " \"13. Research data that may be of future historical interest, including data that substantiate research findings, should normally be offered and assessed for deposit and retention in an appropriate data service, domain repository, the University data repository or (in the case of non-digital material) with DMU Library Special Collections (the University's archive service).\",\n",
       " '14. The legitimate interests of the subjects of research data, and future historical interests, must be protected, e.g. in accordance with data protection laws, research ethics, human rights and duty of confidence.',\n",
       " '15. Where a funding body, publisher or their agent requests exclusive rights to publish or re-use University research data without any assurance that it will be made openly available upon publication, the University’s default position will be to refuse such a request, unless required to grant such rights as part of the terms and conditions of a grant, or under a legal obligation.',\n",
       " '16. Where any research is subject to any associated contractual arrangements and/or grant conditions that conflict with this policy, the provisions of such contractual arrangements and/or grant conditions will take precedence.',\n",
       " '17.It is recognised that there are sound reasons why the openness of research data may need to be restricted.  For example (but not limited to) the following:',\n",
       " 'a. where individuals’ legitimate interests would be compromised (e.g. under the Data Protection Act);',\n",
       " 'b. where data is commercially sensitive;',\n",
       " 'c. where intellectual property rights do not permit;',\n",
       " 'd. where the investment of time/money/resources would be disproportionate to the anticipated benefits to the University and/or research community.',\n",
       " '18. These are decisions that individual researchers should look at on a case by case basis, for each dataset, and (where the project is funded) may have to justify their decision to the research funder.',\n",
       " '19.It is recognised that DMU researchers who generate original data must have reasonable right of exclusive first use for an appropriate and well-defined period, which may vary by subject and discipline area. They may, therefore, wish to set an embargo on the publication of their data. This should be considered from the earliest stages of project planning and set out in the Data Management Plan.',\n",
       " '20. DMU researchers are required to comply with the conditions of their research funders’ data management policies.',\n",
       " '21. Responsibility for the creation of a DMP (where required), the updating of that plan, and the implementation of the plan throughout the research lifecycle during any research project or  programme lies with the PI or most senior DMU researcher associated with the project.',\n",
       " '22. All research data (through funded or unfunded projects) must be assigned a ‘Data Steward’.  This will normally be the most senior DMU researcher associated with the Project to which the dataset relates.  The ‘Data Steward’ is responsible for ensuring the requirements of this policy are met and is the named contact for any enquiries about the data.',\n",
       " '23. Where the research is part of a collaborative project led by an external partner, it is the responsibility of the most senior DMU researcher associated with the project to ensure that DMU is able to meet the requirements of this policy and to keep a copy of any DMP and other data agreements.',\n",
       " '24. When undertaking research projects in collaboration with other institutions, organisations or individuals, DMU researchers should ensure that ownership and copyright of data generated and/or shared is specified in a data sharing agreement which sets out clearly the obligations and permissions of each party with regard to the data.',\n",
       " '25.It is the responsibility of researchers to discuss with the relevant departments (e.g. ITMS, Library and Learning Services) whether there will be any cost to their project for the storage (including server patches), backup, deposit and retention of the project research data; and to ensure, before starting their research project, that any costs during the life of the project and after can be covered.',\n",
       " '26.It is the responsibility of the researcher to handle personal data lawfully and according to DMU’s internal data management procedures and according to the General Data Protection Regulation and Data Protection Act 2018.',\n",
       " '27.It should be the default position that personal data cannot be treated as open data unless fully anonymised. However, it is accepted that in rare circumstances exceptions may need to be made, for example, with regard to oral history. Personal data should not be treated as open data in an un-anonymised form unless agreed by Research Services and, if necessary, by the Information Governance team.',\n",
       " '28. DMU researchers should, where possible, include costs for storing and making data open in external funding applications.',\n",
       " '29. Faculty Associate Deans for Research, Institute Directors and others responsible for research-active staff and students should ensure that DMU researchers in their areas are aware of the University’s policy regarding research data management and its associated guidelines and procedures.',\n",
       " '30. DMU researchers should ensure published results always include information on how to access the supporting data.  Where data supporting publications is made open, it should be accessible by the publication date and in citeable format.',\n",
       " '31. All ‘external DMU researchers’ agree to indemnify DMU in full for any legal costs incurred by DMU in relation to any legal action taken by DMU against any breach of this policy and or any policy mentioned within this policy.',\n",
       " '## DMU’S RESPONSIBILITIES',\n",
       " '32. The University will provide access to training, support, advice and where appropriate, guidelines and templates for research data management and data management plans.',\n",
       " '33. The University will provide the infrastructure for the storage, backup, deposit and retention of research data in support of current and future access, during and after completion of research projects.  This may be charged to the research project (see paragraph 17).',\n",
       " '## ENFORCEMENT',\n",
       " '34. In the event of any breach of this policy and any policy mentioned within this policy, by any ‘DMU researchers’ (as defined above) or ‘external DMU researchers’, DMU reserves the right to take appropriate legal action.',\n",

       " '## Introduction/Rationale',\n",
       " 'Edinburgh Napier University (the University) is committed to delivering excellent research and, as research data is at the very core of evidencing research quality and integrity, it is vital that robust research data management,  open data policies and procedures are in place to ensure that research conducted by, and under the auspices of, Edinburgh Napier University meets the highest standards to comply with legislative, regulatory, audit, funding body, partner (stakeholder) and internal requirements.',\n",
       " 'This policy underlines the University’s commitment to the Universities UK Concordats on open research data and research integrity, by highlighting the importance of the management of research data to good governance and best practice.',\n",
       " 'Further to this, in line with the UK and Scottish Government’ research funders (such as UK Research and Innovation, Horizon Europe and UK research charities) commitment to open data and to ensuring that the outputs from research are freely accessible, the University requires research data to be managed efficiently and effectively to facilitate such use, sharing and publication as appropriate to ensure the maximum benefit is derived from any research undertaken under its auspices.',\n",
       " '# Scope of Policy',\n",
       " 'This policy applies to all researchers and support staff employed to conduct research and innovation activities under the auspices of the University and to all research data regardless of how it is funded. It includes research undertaken by research postgraduate students.',\n",
       " 'This policy covers all data, information and records created, received, and maintained during research activities, in any format whether physical and electronic. These might be quantitative information or qualitative statements collected by researchers in the course of their work by experimentation, observation, modelling, interview or other methods, or information derived from existing evidence. Data may be raw or primary (e.g. direct from measurement or collection) or derived from primary data for subsequent analysis or interpretation (e.g. cleaned up or as an extract from a larger data set) or derived from existing sources where the rights may be held by others.',\n",

       " 'In the case of a PhD project, the Director of Studies is responsible. It is their duty to ensure that all members of the research team with access to the research data adhere to good research data management practice.',\n",
       " 'In the case of collaborative projects, if the Principal Investigator is based elsewhere, the lead researcher at Edinburgh Napier University must take responsibility for all data generated here.',\n",
       " 'Throughout the lifecycle of the research data, researchers and support staff involved in the management of the data must ensure that the following principles are adhered to in order to achieve the objective of the capture and maintenance of authentic, reliable, open and re-useable data:',\n",
       " '1. Researchers must comply with funder data management requirements and are responsible for making themselves familiar with and adhering to legislation (including data protection and trusted research), contractual obligations and funder policies governing their research data.',\n",
       " '2. Ensure they undertake training and cognisance of the guidance and support as offered by the University.',\n",
       " '3. Seek to recover the direct costs of managing research data from the research funder where possible.',\n",
       " '4. Researchers must ensure that active research data are stored securely and protected from loss. University approved systems such as the University networked storage system must be used for storing research data in both original and processed formats. The University has created a central research data file store for this purpose and will provide advice on technical solutions for research data storage and archiving.',\n",
       " '5. Ensure that Metadata describing the structure and content of the data is routinely created and updated, whether manually or automatically, for project continuity purposes in line with University metadata standards and conventions guidance. At the end of the project, researchers will ensure that appropriately structured metadata describing the research data they hold is published (normally within 12 months of the data being generated) and made freely accessible on the internet.',\n",
       " '6. Ensure data is stored for a period at least as long as that required by any funder or sponsor of the research. Research data must be retained after project completion if they substantiate research findings, are of potential long-term value or support a patent for at least 10 years.',\n",
       " '7. Ensure research data that have been selected for retention are made openly available with as few restrictions as possible, unless this would breach legislative, regulatory, contractual, ethical or other obligations, or where the cost of doing so',\n",
       " 'would be prohibitive. Wherever possible, potential restrictions on data should be described in the project’s data management plan.',\n",
       " '8. Register all research data to be openly discoverable with the repository within the University Research Management System, Worktribe, whether they are hosted by the University or maintained elsewhere, even if access to the data is restricted. It is important that the metadata is open even if the datasets themselves cannot be made freely available to comply with FAIR data requirements (Findable, accessible, interoperable and reproducible).',\n",

       " '12. Datasets should be assigned a digital object identifier or DOI (the library can provide on request) and other persistent identifiers such as ORCIDs and grant IDs wherever possible and apply appropriate creative commons licenses to clarify ownership and use of data.',\n",
       " '13. Ensure published research outputs reporting publicly funded research include a data access statement. This is a short statement describing how and on what terms any supporting research data or underlying research materials may be accessed.

       "['# Aalto University  \\n\\n## Aalto University Research Data Management Policy  \\n\\nThe research data management policy aims to make data management easier for the individual researcher. Managing and curating data creates competitive edge, and allocating resources for that is a strategic choice of the university. The purposes of this policy are to (1) encourage to informed decision making in research data management and (2) define the principles used in the opening of publicly funded scientific research data to achieve wide societal impact and the strategic goals of Aalto University.  \\n\\nThe data management policy shall be implemented through conscious and strategic decisions. Open access publishing of research data aims to make research data easily discoverable, assessable, intelligible, usable and interoperable. Where applicable, these requirements can also be applied to data other than open access published research data, and to the software needed to handle the open data. The decisions to publish software, other than the software explicitly needed to handle the data, are done using the same conscious and strategic grounds as opening of the research data.  \\n\\nOwnership of copyright protected research data is transferred to Aalto University if the data is created in an externally funded research project of Aalto University.  Strategic decisions about opening such data are done by the principal investigators. These decisions are done following the guidelines for ethical principles of research as well as the guidelines for responsible conduct of research, project agreements and guidelines for processing of personal data in scientific research,   \\n   \\n\\nResearch data is not opened if the opening would violate privacy, safety, security, terms of project agreements or legitimate concerns of private partners. Researchers shall follow the \"Guideline on nondisclosure of information and information security classification at Aalto University\" and its appendix \"Rules on the handling of information materials\".    \\n\\nWhen deciding on the opening of research data, the possibilities for commercially exploiting the research results and data are taken into consideration. Aalto University will make agreements about the user rights of third parties according to the strategic goals of the university. Aalto University may also charge a fee from third parties for the use of research data.  \\n\\nOpenness of scientific research data will increase the scientific impact of the research, speed up the adoption of research findings and the creation of innovations, enable transparency in science, as well as ensure that research data has wide societal impact and usability in solving global challenges.  \\n\\nOpening access to research data shall be made easy for researchers and implemented in a cost-effective manner so that the resources invested are proportioned to the benefits attainable. An appropriate digital infrastructure will be made available to the researchers by combined European, national and Aalto University efforts.  \\n\\nThe Aalto University research data management policy applies to digital research materials produced, used and revised in research projects, i.e. research data. Physical materials on which research data are based shall be excluded from research data, along with the use of biological research materials. The concept of  \\n\\nAalto University Research Data   \\nManagement Policy   \\nDecision by president of 10 February 2016   \\nAppendix 1  \\n\\nresearch data is not specified further in this policy, as the quality and quantity of research data that is chosen for open access publishing is also chosen using the criteria above. (As regards university document preservation, a data management plan (DMP) required by the Archives Act and the instructions provided by Aalto University’s Archive and Registry Services  shall be abided by.)  \\n\\n### Principles for open access publishing of research data (recommended to be acknowledged in data management in general, where applicable)  \\n\\n#### 1. Discoverability  \\n\\nThe location of research data and the necessary software to access the data is known and they are easily discoverable and identifiable by means of a standard international identification mechanism.  \\n\\n#### 2. Accessibility  \\n\\nResearch data and the necessary software to access the data shall be easily accessible, along with other necessary information to access the data, such as a mention of the concerned research areas.  \\n\\nAn embargo period can be agreed upon, to achieve strategic advantage for the creator. The embargo period is expressed in connection with the material.  \\n\\nFor the research data, a licensing framework has been selected for research and educational use and for commercial exploitation. The license recommended for research data is Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) and the waiver recommended for metadata is CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication. The license recommended for software is the MIT Licence. Other licenses may be chosen to achieve the strategic goals of the research project. If research data is published using the CC BY 4.0 license, Aalto University and researchers obtain sufficient rights for the re-use of the data, even though the ownership of the research data is not transferred to the University. The terms of the CC BY 4.0 license require that the creators of the research data are attributed.  \\n\\n#### 3. Assessability and intelligibility  \\n\\nThe research data and the necessary software to access the data shall be assessable for and intelligible to third parties for scientific scrutiny and peer review. Research data shall be published together with related scientific publications for the purposes of peer review. Research data shall be provided in a way that judgements can be made about its reliability and the competence of those who created it.  \\n\\n#### 4. Usability  \\n\\nThe research data and the necessary software to access the data shall also be usable for purposes beyond the original project. The research data chosen for long-term preservation shall be safely stored and curated to ensure its usability for wider needs than merely a highly specialised expert group. Whenever possible, certified repositories are used for research data preservation.  \\n\\nResearch data shall be stored together with the minimum metadata and documentation to make it useful. Aalto University does not require the creator of the research data to offer support for further use of the data.  \\n\\nWhen applicable and allowed by previous licenses, the necessary software will also be stored together with the research data.  \\n\\n#### 5. Interoperability  \\n\\nThe research data and the necessary software shall be produced in a manner that ensures their interoperability with applicable standards and special quality requirements. Interoperability shall be implemented in a way that allows data exchange between researcher groups, higher education institutions and research institutions in different countries. Interoperability will also allow for the re-combination of different datasets from different origins.  \\n\\n### Related documents and agreements  \\n\\nFinnish Advisory Board on Research Integrity (TENK): Ethical review in human sciences (TENK)   \\nResponsible conduct of research (TENK)   \\nGuideline on non-disclosure of information and information security classification at Aalto University Classification of Information, Guidelines   \\nClassification of Information, Rules on the Handling   \\nExamples of confidential data and IT services   \\n  Guidelines for processing of personal data in scientific research   \\n    \\nAnnex 1 to the Employment Contract, Terms and Conditions on Assigning Rights generated in All Projects which Receive Funding from External Sources   \\n  en_liite_20110831_2.pdf?version=1&modificationDate=1441263348088&api=v2 .   \\nCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)   \\nCC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication   \\nMIT Licence   \\nBackground documents   \\nGuidelines on Data Management in Horizon 2020   \\n    \\nGuidelines on Open Access to Scientific Publications and Research Data in Horizon 2020   \\n    \\nG8 Science Ministers Statement   \\n  Meeting_Statement_12_June_2013.pdf',\n",

       " '# Research Data Management Policy  \\n\\nJuly 2023  \\n\\n## Aston University Research Data Management Policy  \\n\\n### 1. INTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE  \\n\\nThe maintenance of accurate and retrievable data arising from research projects is an essential component of good practice in the conduct of research and a key component of research integrity and research reproducibility. Consideration around research data management and evidence of good research data management should be seen as an integral part of the research process, which is what Aston University expects of all researchers. This is in line with Aston’s values and commitment to deliver research that changes lives for the better through collaborations between students, academic staff and industry leaders.  \\n\\nIn addition, good research data management can benefit the transparency, productivity and overall reliability of the research generated, supporting the research process and visibility of any research outputs. Evidence of good research data management is also a requirement of most funding bodies and publishers of journal articles. Aston University is committed to supporting its researchers to meet the highest standards of research data management and acknowledges that research data management involves numerous stakeholders across the research data lifecycle, from creation through to dissemination and preservation. Therefore, this policy is divided into distinct sections aimed at key stakeholders within the University.  \\n\\nThe University endorses the UKRI Common Principles on Data Policy.  \\n\\n#### 1.1. Purpose of the Policy  \\n\\nThis policy covers Aston’s approach to research data management.  \\n\\nThe purpose of this policy is to:  \\n\\nEnsure that researchers manage their research data effectively, enabling them to:  \\n\\nDemonstrate the highest standards of integrity of their research, Preserve eligible research data for sharing and reuse (as appropriate), Comply with ethical, legal, funder and other requirements in relation to research data and research data management.  \\n\\nEnsure that University Colleges understand their responsibilities in relation to governance of research data management in their departments, Ensure that the University responsibilities for research data management are clearly articulated.  \\n\\n### 2. SCOPE OF POLICY  \\n\\nThis policy covers the processes, arrangements, and limitations for storing research data during the active research process.  \\n\\nFor the purposes of this policy, research data are as defined by the UKRI Concordat on Open Research Data1 as ‘the evidence that underpins the answer to a research question’. The research data can be quantitative or qualitative and may either be primary (generated first hand) or processed secondary data (building upon primary data) where the rights for the original data may be held elsewhere. Contemporary research data tends to exist digitally and takes many different forms including documents, spreadsheets, code, models, transcripts, images etc. However historic, and visual data can still exist in physical records including books, sketches, photographs, audiotapes, and specimens.  \\n\\nFor a more comprehensive table of research data examples please see Appendix 1.  \\n\\nIf you are engaged in a Knowledge Exchange activity whereby you are generating research data, you are expected to abide by the standards set out within this policy.  \\n\\nResearch data preservation for the purpose of sharing is covered by the Data Preservation and Open Research Data Policy.  \\n\\n#### 2.1 Who is Covered by the Policy  \\n\\nThis policy applies to all researchers (defined as any staff members conducting research and doctoral research students) at Aston University with contractual responsibility for research data generation, collection, and/or analysis, or who produce or use research data. The policy stands to detail the management of that data arising from their research, and the roles of the various individuals or services that will support the management of research data during its lifecycle.  \\n\\nThe policy does not apply to postgraduate taught and undergraduate students in the first instance, except where their research findings are included in published research outputs. They may be guided in the first instance by the principles contained within this policy.  \\n\\n#### 2.2 Ownership of this Policy  \\n\\nResearch Committee owns this policy and oversees research data management policy implementation via College Research Committees.  \\n\\nThe Chair of the Research Committee is responsible for ensuring that this policy is reviewed every two years (unless there is significant change in current regulations which impact this policy) and is fit for purpose.  \\n\\n### 3. POLICY STATEMENT  \\n\\n#### 3.1. General research data management  \\n\\nThe University expects that the following general research data management principles will be followed:  \\n\\nResearch data should be actively managed to ensure that it is available for access, validation, and re-use (where appropriate). The rights and interests of research participants must always be protected. Researchers must comply with all relevant regulations, funder requirements, contractual obligations, and ethical requirements, as appropriate, at all times during their research.  \\n\\n#### 3.2 Research data  \\n\\nResearch data must be:  \\n\\nAccurate, auditable, authentic, and reliable.   \\nIdentifiable, retrievable, and available when needed.   \\nSecure and safe with appropriate measures taken in handling sensitive, classified, and confidential data.   \\nKept in a manner that is compliant with legal obligations, University policy and, where applicable, the requirements of funding bodies; and   \\nConsidered for long term preservation.  \\n\\nClear arrangements for research data management must be in place prior to research data generation. The University recommends that all research projects have an associated Research Data Management plan (RDMP), with named researchers and their responsibilities detailed within. This may be a mandatory requirement as part of a grant application, and your Strategic Funding Manager will advise if so. It is the responsibility of the researcher to consider how legal and ethical restrictions will impact on their ability to share data at the end of the project and it is recommended that these considerations are addressed in a RDMP.  \\n\\nResearch data must be stored and disposed of securely according to the relevant retention and disposal schedule, in accordance with legal, ethical, research funder and collaborator requirements and with particular concern for the confidentiality and security of the data. Records relating to research (e.g. master copies of approved consent forms, information sheets, records relating to ethical approval) should be retained for six years after the date of project closure, in line with the University Records Management Procedures. Research data that underpins published results or is considered to have long-term value should be retained.  \\n\\nResearch data should be stored on Box unless there are specific reasons why this is not practical, nor in line with a collaboration agreement (for example). In this case advice should be sought from Digital Services in the first instance, and the Research Integrity Office where appropriate.  \\n\\nThe deliberate or reckless mismanagement of research data and/or primary materials constitutes unacceptable research conduct and should be reported in line with the University Research Misconduct Policy or the Whistleblowing policy.  \\n\\n#### 3.3 Collaborative research  \\n\\nWhen participating in collaborative projects, an Aston University lead must be identified to take responsibility for management of research data produced under the auspices of Aston  \\n\\nUniversity. This person is also responsible for ensuring that data are managed appropriately and in line with any relevant contracts and/or ethics approvals in place.  \\n\\n#### 3.4 What to do when you leave Aston  \\n\\nThe University expects that researchers will make the necessary arrangements to deposit/archive research data associated with projects which are closed, or transfer/make available data and records which are associated with active research projects. It is expected that transfer will occur via Box, with shared ownership of relevant Box folders with other appropriate researchers within the University, noting that this should be done in line with any relevant contracts and/or ethics approvals in place. For any arrangements where Box cannot be used, Digital Services should be consulted to discuss and approve an alternative mechanism.  \\n\\n### 4. ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES  \\n\\n#### 4.1. University  \\n\\nThe University is responsible for:  \\n\\n4.1.1 Providing access to services and facilities for the storage, backup, deposit and retention of research data and records that allow researchers to meet their requirements under this policy and those of the funders.  \\n\\n4.1.2 ensuring that staff and research students understand the requirements for research data management and engage with training and development as necessary.  \\n\\n4.1.3 Providing the necessary resources to those central services responsible for the provision of these services, facilities, and training.  \\n\\n4.1.4 raising awareness of best practice in research data management in which legal, ethical, and professional requirements and standards are considered whenever research data are created, handled, used, shared or stored.  \\n\\n#### 4.2.

This document provides the policy framework through which this effective management can be achieved and audited.  \\n\\n## 1. Purpose & Scope  \\n\\nThe purpose of this policy is to ensure that the University and the University’s staff and students comply with the provisions of the GDPR and the Act and with any other relevant legislation in jurisdictions in which the University operates when processing personal data. Any infringement of the Act will be treated seriously by the University and may be considered under disciplinary procedures.  \\n\\nThis policy applies to staff, students, agents of the University and any authorised processors of personal data held or owned by the University, regardless of where the data is held and, in respect of automatically processed data, the ownership of the equipment used, if the processing is for University purposes.  This policy also applies to personal data retained and processed by Bangor University Students’ Union.  \\n\\n## 2. Data Protection Definitions  \\n\\n### 2.1 Personal data  \\n\\nPersonal data is information that either on its own, or when combined with other information, can identify a living individual. This can include (but is not limited to):  \\n\\nNames, addresses, student and staff ID numbers, dates of birth, photographs, social media handles, video footage and emails.  \\n\\nThe main types of personal data that the University uses are: Staff Data, Student Data (prospective, current and alumni) and Research Data.  \\n\\n### 2.2 Special Category Data  \\n\\nSpecial category data is personal data that needs more protection because it is sensitive. The GDPR defines special category data as:  \\n\\npersonal data revealing racial or ethnic origin;   \\npersonal data revealing political opinions;   \\npersonal data revealing religious or philosophical beliefs;   \\npersonal data revealing trade union membership;   \\ngenetic data;   \\nbiometric data (where used for identification purposes);   \\ndata concerning health;   \\ndata concerning a person’s sex life; and data concerning a person’s sexual orientation.  \\n\\n### 2.3 Processing  \\n\\nData protection legislation refers to the processing of personal data. Processing simply means any use of personal data. This can range from collecting it to sharing it, from amending it to deleting it. The University needs to process information about its employees, its students and other individuals: for example, to allow it to  \\n\\nmonitor performance, achievements and health and safety, and so that staff can be recruited and paid, courses organised and legal obligations (e.g. to funding bodies and the government) fulfilled. Such information must be collected and used fairly, stored safely and not disclosed unlawfully.  \\n\\n## 3. The Principles of Data Protection  \\n\\nThe University is required to adhere to the principles of data protection as laid down by the Act. In accordance with those principles personal data shall be:  \\n\\n1.  Processed fairly, lawfully and in a transparent manner The University must be open and clear about what the personal data will be used for and how it will be used.  \\n\\n2.  Processed for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes The University must ensure that it collects personal data for clear, appropriate and legitimate purposes. Collecting personal data “just in case” for future reference is not compliant with legislation.  \\n\\n3.  Adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the purposes for which they are processed The University must only collect, use or share personal data in a proportionate way. This means that it should collect what it needs to complete its purposes.  \\n\\n4.  Accurate and up to date Personal data must be accurate and up to date. Collecting inaccurate data is a breach of GDPR.  \\n\\n5.  Kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed   \\nPersonal data must only be kept for a specific period of time. This time period will vary depending on what purpose the personal data is collected for - the University’s Record & Data Retention Schedule details how long personal data should be kept for each function.  \\n\\n6.  Processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data  \\n\\nThe University is required to have appropriate technical and organisational measures in place to ensure the security of personal data. This is applicable to both data held electronically and personal data within physical documents.  \\n\\n## 4. The Rights of the Individual  \\n\\nIn addition to the data processing principles, the GDPR also sets out a range of rights individuals can use to understand how their personal data is used or exert an amount of control over how it is used. The rights include:  \\n\\nThe right to be informed An individual has the right to be informed about the collection and use of their personal data.  \\n\\nThe right to access (often called Subject Access Requests)   \\nAn individual has a right to see a copy of the personal data held about them by the University and find out what it is used for. See 6.1 below for further details.  \\n\\nThe right of rectification An individual can request that inaccurate information held about them is either rectified or deleted.  \\n\\nThe right to erasure (also known as the right to be forgotten) An individual may ask for their personal data to be deleted by the University.  \\n\\n### The right to restrict processing  \\n\\nAn individual has the right to request the restriction of suppression of their personal data (i.e. whilst a complaint is being dealt with the University can store the personal data, but not use it).  \\n\\n### The right to data portability  \\n\\nAllows individuals to obtain and reuse their personal data for their own purposes across different organisations.  \\n\\n### The right to object  \\n\\nAn individual has the right to object to the processing of their personal data, for instance to stop their data being used for direct marketing.  \\n\\nRights related to automated decision-making including profiling   \\nAn individual has the right to stop automated decisions being made about them and ask for human intervention instead.  \\n\\n## 5. Responsibilities  \\n\\n### [a] University Responsibilities  \\n\\nThe University is a data controller under the Act and under equivalent legislation in other jurisdictions.  The University is responsible for establishing policies and procedures and providing access to training in order to comply with the requirements of the Act.  \\n\\n#### [i] The Compliance Task Group  \\n\\nThe Compliance Task Group is responsible for the development, implementation, monitoring and review of the University’s Data Protection Policy and associated Procedures. The Compliance Task Group is chaired by the University Secretary and reports to the University Executive who are ultimately responsible for overseeing compliance in this area.  \\n\\n#### [ii] University’s Data Protection Officer  \\n\\nThe Compliance Task Group will nominate an appropriate person as the University's Data Protection Officer, who will be a person of sufficient knowledge and seniority in the University.   \\nThe nominated University Data Protection Officer is the Head of Governance and Compliance in the Governance and Compliance Office.   \\nBangor University has notified the Information Commissioner’s Office that it processes personal data, and queries relating to the University’s notification should be directed to the Data Protection Officer. The University will make arrangements for the identity of the University's Data Protection Officer to be made known to all staff, students, consultants, contractors and volunteers and will also draw to their attention this Policy and associated documentation.   \\nThe Data Protection Officer is tasked with drawing up guidance, giving advice and promoting compliance with this policy in such a way as to ensure the easy, appropriate and timely retrieval of information. The Data Protection Officer (or nominee) has access to all relevant documents relating to a legal compliance request and it is the Data Protection Officer (in consultation with the relevant senior officers) that will make the decisions regarding what information is released or exempted.  \\n\\n### [b] Responsibilities of Pro Vice-Chancellors / Heads of College, Heads of School and Directors of Professional Services  \\n\\nPro Vice-Chancellors / Heads of College, Heads of School and Directors of Professional Services are responsible for ensuring compliance with legislation in relation to personal data and for ensuring that the requirements of this Policy are met.  \\n\\nPro Vice-Chancellors / Heads of College, Heads of School and Directors of Professional Services may choose to delegate the management of, but not the responsibility for, Data Protection matters to a school or departmental Data Protection Co-ordinator. This person will administer and co-ordinate the processes set up within the College, School or Department to manage compliance with data protection legislation and the University’s guidance in this area, and will be a knowledgeable and accessible point of contact for people within the College, School or Department who have questions about data protection issues. Where a Dean, Head or Director chooses to delegate the management of data protection within their College, School or Department the University will provide data protection training which the Data Protection Co-ordinator will be required to undertake.  \\n\\nResponsibility for compliance with the Act’s requirements with regard to personal data on Bangor University alumni has been delegated to the Executive Director of Development & Alumni Services (DAS). Heads of Schools holding and using information on alumni must keep DAS informed about all activities involving former students.  \\n\\nAs part of its internal and external audit programme the University will perform periodic audits to ensure compliance with this Policy and the Act and to ensure that the notification is kept up to date.  \\n\\nPro Vice-Chancellors / Heads of College, Heads of School and Directors of Central Service Departments must ensure that all new members of staff receive an introductory briefing on the Act and that relevant staff members within their areas of responsibility (those dealing with personal and / or sensitive personal data), including any relevant consultants / contractors, receive refresher courses on data protection compliance (available by contacting the Staff Development Unit, Human Resources).  \\n\\n### [c] Staff Responsibilities  \\n\\n[i] When staff members use personal information about students, other members of staff or other individuals they must comply with the requirements of this Policy.   \\n[ii] It is a condition of employment that staff will abide by the rules and policies of the University. Any failure to follow this Policy may result in disciplinary proceedings.  \\n\\nStaff must ensure that:  \\n\\nall personal information entrusted to them in the course of their employment is kept securely.   \\nno personal information is disclosed either verbally or in writing, accidentally or otherwise to any unauthorised third party.   \\nno personal information should be accessed by staff for any reason other than for legitimate University business.   \\nany information that they provide to the University in connection with their own employment is accurate and up to date and that they inform the University of any changes, e.g. changes of address.  \\n\\n[iii] When members of staff are responsible for supervising students doing work which involves the processing of personal information (for example in research projects), they must ensure that those students are aware of the Data Protection Principles as set out in point 3. above, in particular, the requirement to obtain the data subject's freely given, specified, informed and unambiguous consent where appropriate.  \\n\\nA Bangor University student should only use personal data, in relation to their studies, with the knowledge, written agreement and supervision of an appropriate member of staff. This would normally be a postgraduate student’s supervisor, or for an undergraduate student the member of staff responsible for teaching the module. Consideration should also be given to the requirements of the University’s Research Ethics Policy in relation to the use of personal data in research.  \\n\\n[iv] Staff who are unsure about who are the authorised third parties to whom they can legitimately disclose personal data should seek advice from their line manager or the Head of Governance and Compliance.  \\n\\n### [d] Contractors, Short-Term, Casual and Voluntary Staff  \\n\\nThe University is responsible for the use made of personal data by anyone working on its behalf.  Pro ViceChancellors / Heads of College, Heads of School and Directors of Professional Services who employ contractors, short term, casual or voluntary staff must ensure that:  \\n\\nAny personal and / or special category data collected or processed in the course of work undertaken for the University, is kept securely and confidentially. This applies whether the data is an integral part of the work, or whether it is simply contained on media or in places which contractors etc. need to access; it applies whether or not the University explicitly mentions the data in the contract.   \\nAll personal and / or special category data is returned to the University on completion of the work, including any copies that may have been made. Alternatively, that the data is securely destroyed and the University receives notification in this regard from the contractor or short term / voluntary member of staff.   \\nThe University receives details of any disclosure of personal and / or special category data to any other organisation or any person who is not a direct employee of the contractor.   \\nAny personal and / or special category data made available by the University, or collected in the course of the work, is neither stored nor processed outside the UK unless written consent to do so has been received from the Head of Governance and Compliance at the University.   \\nAll practical and reasonable steps are taken to ensure that contractors, short term or voluntary staff do not have access to any personal data beyond what is essential for the work to be carried out properly. The University’s standard data protection clause must be inserted into all relevant University contracts.  \\n\\n## 6. Detailed Policy Requirements  \\n\\n### 6..1. Subject Access Requests  \\n\\nAn individual is entitled to receive from the University:  \\n\\nConfirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning them is being processed, and Where that is the case access to the personal data, and information relating to the purpose of the processing, the categories of personal data being processed, the recipients to whom the personal data has been disclosed, the retention period for the data and the complaints process.  \\n\\nIndividuals wishing to access their own personal data held by the University can do so via a Subject Access Request. Any individual wishing to exercise this right should do so in writing or by email (info-compliance@bangor.ac.uk ) to the Head of Governance and Compliance. A standard form is available on the University’s data protection web pages.  \\n\\nIndividuals will not be entitled to access information to which any of the exemptions in the Act applies. However, only those specific pieces of information to which the exemption applies will be withheld, and information covered by an exemption will be subject to review by the Head of Governance and Compliance  \\n\\nThe University aims to comply with requests for access to personal information as quickly as possible, but will ensure that it is provided within one month as stipulated by the Act and within any relevant time periods set by other jurisdictions.  \\n\\nRequests for access to information held by the University’s Student Counselling service will be dealt with by the Head of Governance and Compliance in consultation with the Head of Counselling.  \\n\\n### 6.2 Consent to process  \\n\\nIt is a condition of the registration of students, and of the employment of staff, that individuals agree to Bangor University’s processing of specified classes of personal data, including special category data.  The University relies on a variety of legal grounds to process information, this includes information required under contract, information which is collected under public task, and information which the University believes it has legitimate interest to process. In some cases, the University needs to process information that, by the definition set out in the GDPR, is classed as special category data. Such information may be needed, for example, to ensure safety, to comply with the requirements of the government or of funding bodies, to provide support for staff or students or to implement institutional policies. In some of these cases, the University may need to seek specific consent from the individual.  \\n\\n### 6.3 Information Collected by the University website  \\n\\nInformation collected on the Bangor University website is owned by Bangor University (including any subsidiary companies).  The University will not sell, share or rent this information to others in ways which differ from what is stated on the University’s website or in any prior agreement. Specific information relating to Bangor University’s website can be found in the University’s Privacy and Cookies Policy.  \\n\\n### 6.4 Data Security Breaches  \\n\\nAny data-related incident or breach or potential breach of the Act, or other equivalent legislation or of the requirements of this Policy should be reported to the Head of Governance and Compliance as soon as possible and, in any case, within 24 hours of discovery.   Incidents will be dealt with in accordance with the University’s Procedures for the Management of a Suspected Data Security Breach.  \\n\\n### 6.5 Sharing of data with third parties  \\n\\nThe sharing of personal and / or special categories data will comply with those details set out in staff contracts and the Data Processing Declarations for staff and students.  \\n\\nStaff, students and others whose personal and / or special categories data may be held by the University, should note that the University has a duty under the Counter-Terrorism and Security Act 2015 to have due regard to the need to prevent people from being drawn into terrorism, and that this duty may involve the passing of information to the police / security services in certain limited cases, overseen by the requirements of the University’s Prevent Policy, and the Information Sharing Agreement between statutory partners in the North Wales area.  \\n\\n### 6.6 Request for Information by Law Enforcement Agencies  \\n\\nThere are exemptions within the Data Protection Act which allow the University, under strict guidelines, to release information to law enforcement agencies without the consent of the individual whose information is being released, and regardless of the purpose for which the information was originally collected.  \\n\\nThe University should respond to all such requests for information in a consistent manner and it therefore operates a Single Point of Contact system for all law enforcement requests which is overseen by the Head of Governance and Compliance.  \\n\\nA detailed procedure outlining how the University deals with such requests is included as Appendix 1 to this Policy.  \\n\\n### 6.7 Request for Information from Statutory Agencies  \\n\\nThe University will seek to respond to requests for information from Statutory Agencies (e.g. Local Authorities) in relation to  \\n\\nA child, young person or vulnerable adult;   \\nProceedings / investigations relating to a child, young person or vulnerable adult.  \\n\\nin a consistent manner.  \\n\\nIn relation to such requests the University will follow the guidelines laid down in the All Wales Child Protection Procedures and also the provisions of Section 115 of the Crime and Disorder Act. Such requests will be considered by the Head of Governance and Compliance on the understanding that the Agency is able to confirm that there is an overriding public interest to justify the disclosure, and in particular the University, in making its decision, will seek to satisfy itself that one or more of the following considerations are relevant:  \\n\\nThe disclosure is necessary for the prevention or detection of crime, prevention of disorder, to protect public safety or protect the rights and freedoms of others; The disclosure is necessary for the protection of young or other vulnerable people The risks posed by the individual The vulnerability of those who may be at risk \\uf0b7 The impact of the disclosure on the offender Is the disclosure proportionate to the intended aim Are there equally effective but less intrusive alternative means of achieving the aim Where there is an overriding public interest in favour of disclosure the University will, as set out in Section 1.5.3 of the All Wales Child Protection Procedures require the specific detail of the request, and whether the consent of the individual has been sought and / or given.  \\n\\n### 6.8 Coursework / Examination Marks / Publication of Examination Marks  \\n\\nStudents will be entitled to information about their marks or grades for both coursework and examinations. However, as outlined in Schedule 2, Section 25(3) of the Act, this may take longer than other information to provide where a result has not yet been ratified.  \\n\\nWhen a subject access request is made for examination marks, the University is obliged to respond by the earlier of:  \\n\\n40 days after the announcement of the results OR Five months from the receipt of the request, the fee and all reasonably required information.  \\n\\nUnless students are informed in advance and given the chance to opt out, the publication of exam results in an identifiable format either online or in a publicly accessible area of the University would not be acceptable under the requirements of the Act and this Policy. Students should be informed as early as possible in the academic year what the procedure will be for accessing their examination results.  \\n\\n## 7. Complaints  \\n\\nThe Head of Governance and Compliance will coordinate any complaints received in respect of this policy.  \\n\\nThe complaint should be addressed to the Head of Governance and Compliance in the first instance. The complaint will be acknowledged immediately and every reasonable effort will be made to offer a more comprehensive reply within 21 days.   \\nIf the applicant is not satisfied with the reply then they should inform the Head of Governance and Compliance within 21 days. The complaint will then be forwarded to the University Secretary and will be dealt with in accordance with the University’s Staff & General Complaints Procedure or the University’s Student Complaints Procedure as appropriate.  \\n\\nIf applicants are dissatisfied with the outcome of the Complaints Procedure they may seek an independent review from the Information Commissioner. Requests for review by the Information Commissioner should be mad e in writing to:  \\n\\nThe Information Commissioner, 2nd Floor Churchill House, Churchill Way, Cardiff CF10 2HH Tel: 02920 678 400  \\n\\n## 8.

Relevant Legislation, Codes of Practice and Industry Standards  \\n\\nData Protection Act 2018   \\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation   \\nCounter Terrorism and Security Act 2015   \\nFreedom of Information Act 2000   \\nLimitation Act 1980  \\n\\n## 10. Related Policies and Procedures  \\n\\nOther relevant University policies include, but are not limited to:  \\n\\nRecords Management Policy   \\nFreedom of Information Policy   \\nInformation Security Policy   \\nProcedures for the Management of a Suspected Data Security Breach   \\nGuidance on the Destruction of Records Containing Confidential Data   \\nPrevent Policy   \\nHigher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) Collection Notices for Students and Staff   \\nCCTV Code of Practice  \\n\\n## Appendix 1  \\n\\n### Disclosure Procedure: Request for Information by Law Enforcement Agencies  \\n\\n### 1. Background  \\n\\nThese Procedures are intended to cover situations where the University receives requests from the Police or other organisations / agencies with law enforcement responsibilities (such as the Department for Work and Pensions, local authorities, HM Customs and Revenue and the UK Visas and Immigration) for personal information about students, staff or other individuals whose information the University holds.  These Procedures also include requests for the provision of any CCTV footage2.  \\n\\nPersonal information held by the University is managed in accordance with the Data Protection Act 2018 (the Act) and the University’s Data Protection Policy3.  The Act and the University’s Policy provide guidance on the circumstances when it is lawful to disclose and transfer personal information outside the University and in general this should be carried out “fairly and lawfully” and in accordance with the University’s Data Protection Notification.  \\n\\nThere are, however, exemptions within the Act which allow the University, under strict guidelines, to release information to law enforcement agencies without the consent of the individual whose information is being released, and regardless of the purpose for which the information was originally collected.  \\n\\nIn particular personal information may be released if:  \\n\\nthe information is required for safeguarding national security failure to provide the information would prejudice the prevention or detection of crime, the apprehension or prosecution of offenders or the assessment or collection of any tax or duty  \\n\\nPersonal information may also be disclosed without contravening the terms of the Act where that disclosure is required by law.  \\n\\nBefore the University releases any information to a law enforcement agency it must satisfy itself that the disclosure is necessary and required for a legitimate purpose.  \\n\\nThe University seeks to co-operate with the police and with other agencies in the prevention and detection of crime and these Procedures set out the steps to be followed when responding to requests for personal information from these external agencies.  \\n\\nThese Procedures should also be considered in conjunction with the University’s Prevent Policy and its Information Sharing Agreement with partners to the Prevent and Channel Programme.  \\n\\n### 2. Requests for Information  \\n\\nIt is important that the University responds to all requests for information in a consistent manner and the University therefore operates a Single Point of Contact system for all law enforcement requests which is overseen by the Head of Governance and Compliance, Governance and Compliance Office.  To facilitate this any member of staff who receives a request for personal information from the Police or any other agency with law enforcement responsibilities must forward it as soon as possible to the Compliance and Records Officer or the Head of Governance and Compliance.  The Head of Governance and Compliance will then ensure that the request is handled in accordance with the remainder of these Guidelines.  Further advice on requests for information from the police or other agencies should be directed to the Head of Governance and Compliance.  \\n\\nStaff should not feel pressurised to disclose information “on the spot”, as it is very rare that the police or agencies require the information urgently (although such circumstances are dealt with in Section 4 below).  \\n\\n### 3. Governance and Compliance Office Procedures  \\n\\n#### [a] Police Requests  \\n\\nAll police forces have standard forms which must be used to request personal information from Bangor University, in accordance with guidance issued by the Association of Chief Police Officers.  The form must certify that the information is required for an investigation concerning national security, the prevention or detection of crime or the apprehension or prosecution of offenders, and that the investigation would be prejudiced by a failure to disclose the information.  All requests from the police, (apart from emergency requests, which are dealt with at section 4. below,) should be received on a data protection form, should clearly state all the information being requested and should be signed and dated by an officer of the rank of Sergeant or above.  \\n\\n#### [b] Other Agencies with Law Enforcement Responsibilities  \\n\\nOther agencies may not routinely use standard forms to submit their requests.  However, any request for personal information should:  \\n\\nBe in writing, on headed paper, and signed by an officer of the agency;   \\nDescribe the nature of the information which is requested;   \\nDescribe the nature of the investigation in broad terms, including citing any relevant statutory authority for requesting the information;   \\nCertify that the information is necessary for the investigation.  \\n\\nOn receipt of such a request the data would normally be disclosed, after due consideration of the University’s legal position to provide such data, by the Head of Governance and Compliance.  \\n\\n### 4. Requests for Disclosure of Information in Emergency Situations  \\n\\nThe University acknowledges that, from time to time and in extraordinary circumstances, police forces, other law enforcement agencies or other emergency services may urgently require personal data from the University and may not be in a position to complete the usual required paperwork at that time.  These requests are usually received by the University’s Security Section but may be received by any member of staff. Requests of this type would include urgent requests for provision of CCTV footage for genuine police operational reasons and / or requests for contact information for members of staff or students.  \\n\\nIn these circumstances, during normal office hours, staff should contact the Compliance and Records Officer or the Head of Governance and Compliance, in the first instance for advice and authorisation before providing any information / CCTV footage.  \\n\\nIf the request is being dealt with out of normal office hours, during University holidays or at a weekend and information or images are required immediately to deal with an ongoing police or other law enforcement incident the procedures outlined below should be followed:  \\n\\n1. The University’s Security Section should note all of the emergency information required, the circumstances of the request and the name, rank and number of the requesting Police Officer.  \\n\\n2. Authorisation and / or advice should then be sought advice from the Campus Services Manager (Security) or Deputy.   \\n3. Where the request isn’t straightforward, or the information isn’t easily located the Campus Services Manager (Security) or Deputy may seek advice from the Head of Governance and Compliance.   \\n4. Once the release of information or images is authorised the Security Team Leader or Assistant should note in the security log the exact circumstances of the request, the name, rank and number of the requesting Police Officer. This information should be forwarded to the Compliance and Records Officer and the Head of Governance and Compliance as soon as practicably possible.   \\n5. If information / images are released in emergency circumstances the Governance and Compliance Team will ensure that the request is followed up with a formal written request from the relevant law enforcement agency, either by supplying a data protection form or a letter on headed paper appropriately authorised.\",\n",
       " \"# Brunel University Research Data Management Policy  \\n\\nResearchers and the University have obligations to preserve, store and provide access to research outputs, including research data. Demonstrable good practice in research data management and a commitment to data sharing are increasingly required by funding organisations and research partners. There are also benefits for the University and individual researchers: increased research impact and profile; wider benefits for the research community and the public; advancement of knowledge; opportunities for growth.  \\n\\nThe following policy supports the Brunel University Research Data Management Vision, which was approved by Senate in March 2012 and forms part of the University’s research integrity code of practice.  \\n\\n## Vision  \\n\\nResearch data management is the planning, capture, review, publication, storage, preservation and re-use of data produced by research, irrespective of format.  \\n\\nThe University views effective research data management as an essential ingredient of a high quality research culture.   \\nIt assumes that all data produced by University researchers will be made available to the wider academic community, except where the right of individual researchers, or the subjects of the research, would be compromised by such release.   \\nThe University provides training, support, advice and information to support effective research data management.   \\nResearch data management is a shared responsibility. Individual researchers, academic units and central departments work together to develop research data management plans and implement them throughout the research life cycle.   \\nAll research proposals include an integral research data management plan.   \\nThe University actively supports the collection, storage, retention and cataloguing of all its research data (both raw and published) and promotes its re-use by other researchers where appropriate and with due safeguards.   \\nResearch data management policies safeguard the interests of participants in the research, the researchers and the University by facilitating compliance with relevant legislation.   \\nAll research data is stored securely and is registered with the University. Data is stored in the data centres of higher educational institutions or in subject-specific data services.   \\nAll University policies, including those on Intellectual Property, Good Research Practice and the Procedures for Investigation of Research Misconduct, support good practice in research data management.  \\n\\n   \\n\\nThis policy will continue to evolve in line with the changing research environment, in consultation with the research community.  \\n\\n# Policy  \\n\\n## Scope of applicability  \\n\\nResearch data is defined as the evidence base on which academic researchers build their analytic or other work (HEFCE, 2008).  \\n\\nThis policy applies in the first instance to academic staff and postgraduate research students (PGRs). It is expected that data generated by undergraduate (UG), postgraduate taught students (PGTs) and non-academic staff in the normal course of study or administration will normally be exempt from this policy, except where any of the following applies:  \\n\\na. data is generated in connection with an eligible research project, eg funded in whole or in part by Research Councils UK (RCUK), or other public body;   \\nb. the data is generated under a contract of employment with the University, or other agreement (such as a Non-Disclosure/Confidentiality Agreement with a research sponsor / partner;   \\nc. the individual staff member or student has formally published research outputs (conference proceedings, articles, monographs) from the data, in affiliation with Brunel University or jointly-authored with Brunel University staff.  \\n\\nThe terms of this policy will apply in this instance. Staff and students who are uncertain as to whether the policy applies to their situation can contact researchdata@brunel.ac.uk for guidance.  \\n\\n## Managing research data  \\n\\n1. The University will manage research data in accordance with the University's policies, procedures and standards, and statutory and funder requirements.   \\n2. Research data generated by academic staff, students on research degrees, and other staff and students where the research activity falls within the scope of this policy, should be managed in accordance with this policy.  (In this policy the term ‘researcher’ shall refer to all these groups of staff and students.)   \\n3. All researchers are expected to familiarise themselves with the University’s policies and guidance in relation to research integrity, including: Intellectual Property, Good Research Practice, Open Access, Research Data Management, Research Ethics. Researchers are required to manage research data in accordance with these.   \\n4. Heads of Departments, Directors of Research Institutes or equivalent who have overall responsibility for research staff and students must ensure that all research staff and students are aware of the University's research data management and related policies, procedures and guidelines:     \\n5. The Principal Investigator/s or equivalent is responsible for managing compliance with the University and funder research data management policy and requirements during a research project.   \\n6. Researchers are expected to create and maintain data management plans for research where research data may be generated. Where no pro-forma has been specified, researchers may use University data management planning templates available from the Research Support and Development Office (RSDO:    \\n\\n7. The University will develop and provide guidance, training and support regarding research  \\n\\ndata management: researchdata@brunel.ac.uk See also information on the Library website and RSDO ata ownership 8. Researchers should clarify the ownership of any datasets which are used or generated and of derivative IP for all research projects or ventures generated in collaborations or partnerships, at the proposal stage or by the start of a project.  Researchers are invited to seek advice from: researchdata@brunel.ac.uk 9. Where research data is generated wholly by the researcher, data ownership will normally belong to the University and/or the research funder.  Researchers are invited to seek advice at the proposal stage or by the start of a project from: researchdata@brunel.ac.uk 10. Where all the researchers working on a publicly funded research project are from HE institutions, it is expected that institutional policies will be derived from RCUK policy and expectations and will be similar in principle. While the lead institution and Principal Investigator (PI)will have overall responsibility for ensuring that research data is made available appropriately, and will do so in line with the relevant institutional policy, where this is not Brunel, no conflict with University policy is expected. 11. Where research data is generated in cross-sector collaborations or where third party data is used, data ownership and management can be very complex.  Researchers working within cross-sector collaborations with industry partners should pay particular attention to data ownership and derivative IP generated to ensure that as a minimum, data which underpins a research publication they produce may be published or deposited in an open access data archive.  Researchers are invited to seek advice from University research support services and should contact researchdata@brunel.ac.uk in the first instance. 12. Researchers should abide by the conditions set by the data owner/s, in particular relating to data confidentiality and sharing. Where this is in conflict with University and/or funder policy on data sharing, they should seek guidance from RSDO and/or the Library who will advise further. 13. Ownership information for all data generated or modified should be recorded in the metadata or embedded within datasets as appropriate. 14. Where data ownership must be transferred to a third party, researchers must retain sufficient rights to make research data openly available for reuse, unless this contravenes funder requirements or conditions of data owners. 15. Researchers must not give away exclusive rights to publish, reuse or store research data to third parties, unless doing so is a condition of funding (eg for reasons of confidentiality, research  ethics). If so, researchers should seek advice in the first instance. 16. Researchers who leave the University to work at another HEI while a research project is ongoing may generally expect to retain access to datasets for the duration of the project: each case may need individual consideration as to the most appropriate way to achieve this. RCUK policy takes precedence, and data must be made available alongside any research publications which are published in affiliation with the University.  In some instances, it may be appropriate for data to be transferred, such as where the research project will be moving to another institution. Researchers should seek advice from researchdata@brunel.ac.uk.  \\n\\nData storage and sharing   \\n17. Researchers are expected to maintain research data in formats which facilitate data access and sharing.   \\n18. Researchers should create and record sufficient metadata to facilitate the research data discovery and access. The University will develop guidance to help researchers standardise metadata creation and format by data type.   \\n19. All published research outputs will be required to contain sufficient information about how the supporting data can be accessed.   \\n20. Research data may be deposited within appropriate designated storage at the University or an appropriate external data repository or service (eg UK Data Archive, Figshare). Advice should be sought from the research group, funder or the University in case of doubt about what storage facilities might be appropriate.   \\n21. All Brunel University research data must be registered and recorded centrally with the University, irrespective of storage location: research.data@brunel.ac.uk   \\n22. Research data must be retained intact in an appropriate format and storage facility, normally for a period of at least 10 years from the date of any publication which is based upon it. Where specific regulations with regard to data retention apply, eg from funders, these regulations should prevail, particularly where the required retention period is longer than the University requires.   \\n23. The University is committed to preserving and storing research data and will provide advice and/or data storage facilities for data that is not suitable for deposit in an external data repository or service. Initial advice should be sought from research.data@brunel.ac.uk. The minimum period of storage will be (10 years, or as directed by the funder).   \\n24. The University will provide guidance and services for researchers to register data locations centrally to facilitate access to research data.   \\n25. There may be limited periods of privileged use of data for RCUK funded researchers to enable publication of research outputs and ensure appropriate recognition for research teams.  In general, the data which specifically underpins a research publication, should be made available alongside the publication. Publisher embargo periods for research outputs, where not in conflict with RCUK policy on acceptable embargo periods for the discipline, will generally apply.   \\n26. Information on embargo periods by publisher and funder is available from    Additional guidance will be developed by the University as funder policy and requirements continue to evolve, and will be made available from the Library website. These will vary by discipline and Research Council and further guidance will be developed in conjunction with input from researchers.   \\n27.

However, should you require the document in an alternative format please contact the University Secretariat.  \\n\\n© Buckinghamshire New University  \\n\\n## Introduction  \\n\\n1 The effective management of research data is crucial for ensuring the integrity, reproducibility, and impact of scholarly work. Buckinghamshire New University (BNU) is committed to upholding the highest standards of academic research by implementing a robust Research Data Management (RDM) policy. This policy outlines the principles, responsibilities, and good research practices that govern the lifecycle of research data, from creation and storage to sharing and disposal.  \\n\\n2 BNU promotes compliance with relevant funder and publisher policies, supports the Concordat on Open Research Data, the UKRI Common Principles on Data, endorses Horizon Europe\\'s principle that data should be \"as open as possible, as closed as necessary\" and follows FAIR Principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable).  \\n\\n3 In common with all UK Higher Education Institutions, the University is required to comply with specific requirements such as those under the Prevent counter-terrorism statutory responsibility for managing security-sensitive research data. This Policy includes the requirement for such information to both be secured and to offer access only to those who require it for study, in respect of research that has been approved by the University Research Ethics Panel.  \\n\\n4 Research data management refers to the storage, curation, preservation and provision of continuing access to digital research data.  \\n\\n### Purpose  \\n\\n5 The primary objective of the Research Data Management policy is to:  \\n\\nPromote research excellence: facilitate high-quality research by ensuring data is accurate, reliable, complete and accessible.   \\nEnsure secure data storage: ensure data is stored securely and preserved in order to ensure its continuing utility.   \\nEnsure compliance: when handling data protected by the UK Data   \\nProtection Act (2018) and the UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), together with any other applicable data protection or privacy laws such as the Freedom of Information Act 2000, and following the requirements of relevant funding bodies and project-specific protocols approved under BNU’s Research Ethics Policy.   \\nEnhance reproducibility and transparency: support the reproducibility of research findings by maintaining detailed records of data handling processes. Protect intellectual property: safeguard the intellectual property and sensitive information of researchers and participants.   \\nFacilitate data sharing: encourage data sharing and collaboration within the research community and beyond, in line with open access principles.   \\nSupport sustainable data practices: promote sustainable data   \\nmanagement practices to ensure long-term preservation and usability of research data.  \\n\\n### Scope  \\n\\n6 This policy applies to all members of the University involved in research activities, including staff, students, and persons with honorary positions (hereafter referred to as researchers covers all types of research data, regardless of format, method of generation or method of collection for data gathered during a research project conducted by or on behalf of BNU.   \\n7 Research data includes, but is not limited to text files, spreadsheets, transcripts, photographs, film, audiotapes, data files, database content and artefacts. Where possible, researchers should maintain data in formats which facilitate data access and sharing. Guidance on suitable file formats is available from the UK Data Archive.   \\n8 Not all research data is suitable for long term preservation, but, as a guide, all data that underpins research publications and validates research findings should be preserved in accordance with the Data Management Plan.   \\n9 This policy sits alongside the Data Protection Policy and is subject to the same enforcement rules.  \\n\\n### Responsibilities of the University  \\n\\n10 The University will  \\n\\nSupport the principle of open access to the research data where ethically, legally, and commercially appropriate.   \\nProvide infrastructure and support for secure data storage and management. BNU is committed to continual improvement in its storage and management of research data.   \\nProvide support, advice and training to researchers on best practices in research data management.   \\nMonitor compliance with the RDM policy and address any issues that arise. The Research Data Management pages on the staff Intranet provide detailed guidance and training to support researchers in the management of research data. Publish an annual reminder for researchers to register their published data with BNU.  \\n\\n### Responsibilities of the Researchers  \\n\\n11 Researchers are responsible for ensuring that all research data is managed in compliance with this policy and the UK GDPR requirements. This includes the proper documentation, storage, and sharing of data, as well as ensuring that the legitimate interests of research participants are protected at all times. This includes, but is not limited to, seeking informed consent for the recording of personal data and ensuring that data is not shared with an individual or organisation not bound by the UK GDPR or equivalent legislation.  Researchers should seek advice from the Research and  \\n\\nEnterprise Directorate, Digital Technical Services and University Research Ethics Panel when uncertainties arise.  \\n\\n2 The responsibility for data management for any research project lies with the most senior researcher associated with the project.  \\n\\n13 Researchers must also:  \\n\\nProtect confidential, personal, and/or sensitive research data in accordance with the legal and ethical requirements related to the research they conduct. Ensure that ownership of research data and any intellectual property is in accordance with the BNU Intellectual Property Policy and that said ownership is properly established before the start of a project.   \\nCreate and adhere to Data Management Plans (DMPs) for research projects in line with funders’ requirements. All plans should address data capture, documentation and metadata, ethical and legal compliance, storage and backup, and selection of data for long term storage. DMP Online provides an online tool to support the creation of Data Management Plans.   \\nDeposit their data in an appropriate data repository and provide sufficient information (such as a metadata record) to ensure that it can be found, understood, and cited. Where data is deposited somewhere other than BNU’s institutional repository (BNU Knowledge Archive), a metadata record should also be created in the BNU repository which describes and points to the data. External repositories, where used, should support the use of Open Researcher and Contributor IDs (ORCIDs) and Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs).   \\nShare data in accordance with the principles of open access (see BNU’s Open Access Policy).   \\nWhere possible, researchers should seek to recover any cost associated with research data management from the funding body.  \\n\\n14 All research data must be registered with the University whether it is hosted by the University or retained elsewhere. Researchers are responsible for informing the Research and Enterprise Directorate of the location of the data and who will have access to it. BNU retains the right to store a copy of the data for an acceptable period to ensure regulatory or contractual compliance. Guidance on how to register data with BNU, is available on the Research Data Management pages of the staff intranet.  \\n\\n15 Data should be preserved in accordance with the project specific Data Management Plan, which will outline specific retention periods. These periods may vary depending on the nature of the data and the requirements of specific research projects, as discussed in section 8. The Records Retention Schedule provides guidance on the preservation of data.  \\n\\n16 Not all research data is suitable for long term preservation, for example data which contains highly sensitive personal information that cannot be adequately anonymised, when consent has been withdrawn, or when legal or ethical constraints dictate otherwise. The Classifying Information section on the staff intranet provides guidance on this. Staff can also consult with the University Ethics Panel and the Research and Enterprise Directorate to determine appropriate actions in these cases.  \\n\\n### Other relevant University policies  \\n\\n17 This policy should be read in conjunction with the University’s other policies and guidance including:  \\n\\nBNU Knowledge Archive Policy   \\nCode of Good Research Practice   \\nResearch Ethics Policy   \\nData Protection Policy   \\nIntellectual Property   \\nIntellectual Property – Guidelines for Staff   \\nOpen Access Policy   \\nRecords Retention Schedule  \\n\\n### Useful resources  \\n\\nBNU Knowledge Archive   \\nClassifying Information (BNU staff intranet)   \\nData Protection (BNU staff intranet)   \\nThe Digital Curation Centre (DCC)   \\nDMP Online- an online tool to support the creation of Data Management Plans   \\nResearch Data Management (BNU staff intranet)   \\nThe UK Data Service has produced a step-by-step guide for researchers around GDPR compliance.

We have a legal (Equality Act 2010) and ethical obligation to ensure our policies, systems and processes are fair, inclusive and ensure every member of the BNU community can thrive.  \\n\\nWhilst we all have protected characteristics, we know there are certain characteristics and communities that are marginalised and underrepresented in Higher Education and the workplace. These are: different ethnicities (including Gypsy, Roma, Traveller, Showmen and Boaters, migrants, refugees and asylum seekers) Disabled individuals; neurodiverse individuals; pregnancy (including maternity and paternity impact); the LGBT+ community; carers; people of different faiths; people impacted by menopause and individuals from a range of backgrounds including: socio-economic disadvantage, homeless, alcohol and/or substance misuse, people experiencing domestic and/or sexual violence, ex-armed forces, looked after children and care leavers. We also know individuals have multiple intersectional experiences and different points in their lives and careers.  \\n\\n### 1. With reference to the above characteristics, in what ways does this policy enhance equality and the access of opportunity at BNU?  \\n\\nThis policy has been updated to reference BNU’s commitment to best sector practice in relation to making data accessible to all. BNU is committed to the Concordat on Open Research Data, the UKRI Common Principles on Data and endorses Horizon Europe\\'s principle that data should be \"as open as possible as closed as necessary\" and follow FAIR Principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable).  \\n\\nA fundamental principle of this policy is, where possible, to support research data in being freely available online, at no costs and without restriction to all.  \\n\\n### 2. In what ways does the policy adversely impact individuals from marginalised and underrepresented communities?  \\n\\nThis policy does not distinguish or impact differently between people of different characteristics and communities in any way. It is a policy which is applicable to all members of the BNU community and public.  \\n\\n3. How does this proposal work towards achieving the BNU Equality Objectives as outlined in the Equality Strategy 2023-2028? Please signpost objectives and actions in the BNU Equality Strategy.  \\n\\nThis policy aligns with Priority three: Build a university community where people can be themselves. Objective E: Develop a welcoming and supportive online presence. It provides the mechanism for staff and students to be able to freely publish their research and for this to be available to all.  \\n\\nSigned: Name: Date:  \\n\\n  \\n\\nProf. Florin Ioras 11/07/2024  \\n\\n  \\n\\nHigh Wycombe Campus   \\nQueen Alexandra Road   \\nHigh Wycombe   \\nBuckinghamshire   \\nHP11 2JZ Aylesbury Campus 59 Walton Street Aylesbury   \\nBuckinghamshire   \\nHP21 7QG   \\nUxbridge Campus   \\n106 Oxford Road   \\nUxbridge   \\nMiddlesex   \\nUB8 1NA  \\n\\nBNU based at Pinewood Studios  \\n\\nPinewood Studios Pinewood Road   \\nIver Heath   \\nBuckinghamshire SLO 0NH  \\n\\nMissenden Abbey London Road Great Missenden Buckinghamshire HP16 0BD',\n",
       " '# Cardiff Metropolitan University Research Data Management Policy  \\n\\n## 1. Introduction  \\n\\n1.1 Cardiff Metropolitan University recognises that the maintenance of accurate and retrievable data arising from the work of its research community is vital to good practice in research conduct.  \\n\\n1.2 In addition, it is widely accepted that publicly funded research data are a public good which should, wherever possible, be made openly available with as few restrictions as possible in a timely and responsible manner, as set out in RCUK’s Common Principles on Data Policy.  \\n\\n1.3 It is recognised that there is much progress to be made at Cardiff Met in relation to research data management and that it will take time to support and encourage changes in research practice related to the archiving and sharing of research data.  \\n\\n1.4 This being the case, it is expected that this policy will, in the first instance, be fully adhered to only in relation to externally funded research projects.  It is nonetheless the ultimate aim that all research carried out by staff and students at Cardiff Met will be conducted within the auspices of this policy.  This will be achieved via a phased implementation of a programme of support which will encourage changes in research data management practices across the institution.  \\n\\n## 2. Definitions  \\n\\n2.1 The institutional Data Management and Governance Policy defines data as distinct units of information such as numbers, letters or symbols, usually formatted in a specific way.  For the purposes of this policy, the term research data is clarified as information gathered through the pursuit of research activity.  Such information may be in a variety of forms including quantitative data, interview recordings or transcripts, video or audio recordings.  \\n\\n## 3. Link to other institutional policies  \\n\\n3.1 This document sets out the overarching policy in relation to research data management at Cardiff Metropolitan University.  It does however link to several other institutional policies and procedures and should therefore be read in conjunction with them.  Of particular significance are:  \\n\\nOpen Access Policy   \\nPolicy on storage of Research Data   \\nProcedures for ethics approval   \\nResearch Misconduct Policy   \\nData Management and Governance Policy   \\nPREVENT Policy  \\n\\n# Cardiff Metropolitan University Research Data Management Policy  \\n\\n## 4. Storage, retention and sharing of data: expectations  \\n\\n4.1 The production of open research data is acknowledged as a legitimate output of the research process. This being the case, research data produced by Cardiff Metropolitan University will be accurate, complete and reliable and every effort will be taken to ensure data are identifiable and retrievable, and openly available where appropriate.  Data shall be stored in a manner compliant with legal and ethical obligations as well as any requirements specific to the funder of the research.  Where issues of confidentiality and/or anonymity arise, these shall be of paramount importance when considering how and where data will be stored and made available.  \\n\\n4.2 Data will be stored in a secure repository suited to the data set concerned. Where data are stored in an external repository, full details of the location of the data will be registered with the institution and details will be attached to any relevant publications by the Library.  \\n\\n4.3 Data supporting and underlying published research outputs will, wherever possible, be made available upon publication of the output and will be preserved for an appropriate period.  To enable this, sufficient metadata will be recorded and made available to enable others to understand the research and re-use potential of the data. Published outputs will include information on how to access the supporting data.  \\n\\n4.4 The minimum period for retention of research data will be ten years from the date of publication.  However where the funder of the research requires a longer retention period, this will be adhered to.  \\n\\n4.5 Retention periods will be decided as part of the Data Management planning exercise. Once the initial retention period as stated in the Data Management Plan has lapsed, a review will take place to assess whether the data should be retained for a further period.  Data with acknowledged long-term value will be preserved and remain accessible and usable for future research.  Conversely, data which has attracted little interest for more than ten years will not be expected to be retained.  \\n\\n4.6 The storage of outputs and data derived from undergraduate or taught post graduate research projects will be subject to the expectations of this policy where it is the intention to publish the results of the research.  In cases where there is no intention to publish, the storage of the outputs and data will be governed by the regulatory arrangements of the relevant award.  \\n\\n4.7 It is recognised that there are instances where it is necessary to restrict access to research data however, any access restrictions placed on data must be justified and justifiable.  It is anticipated that such restrictions will be related to the maintenance of confidentiality, the protection of the privacy of research participants, commercial sensitivity or issues related to IP.  \\n\\n4.8 Where confidentiality provisions apply, data will be kept in a way that reference to them by third parties can occur without breaching such confidentiality.  Confidentiality agreements to protect intellectual property rights may be agreed between the institution, the researcher and a sponsor of the research. Where such agreements limit free publication and discussion, limitations and restrictions must be explicitly agreed.  \\n\\n# Cardiff Metropolitan University Research Data Management Policy  \\n\\n## 5. Data Management Planning  \\n\\n5.1 Cardiff Met recognises that, in order for data to be openly discoverable, accessible and useable, the management of data must be considered from the beginning of the research process.  Therefore, in order that issues related to the collection and generation of data are considered at the earliest possible stage, Principal Investigators will develop a Data Management Plan as part of the planning stages of their research project.  \\n\\n5.2 The Data Management Plan will consider issues related to data collection, storage and backup of data, data preservation and data sharing. Academics will be supported in the development of their Data Management Plan by relevant support staff based in central units and their School or Unit.  \\n\\n## 6. Responsibilities  \\n\\nThe development of open research data depends on the ability of all involved to understand their responsibilities and to optimise their own opportunities.  \\n\\n6.2 Cardiff Met expects individual researchers to be responsible for:  \\n\\nEnsuring that their own  knowledge in relation to data management is sufficient to meet their obligations.  This will include familiarity and adherence to the Research Councils UK Common Principles on Data Policy.   \\nManaging research data and records in accordance with the principles and expectations of this policy.   \\nConsideration of how they will manage the data they collect and generate at an early stage of research planning using a Data Management Plan.  This should include planning for ongoing custodianship of their data after the research has been completed and consideration of where data will be located and stored should they leave the institution.   \\nEnsuring any requirements in relation to research data management set by the funders of their research or by the terms of a research contract are adhered to. Adherence with Cardiff Met’s Open Access Policy.   \\nAdherence with PREVENT where applicable.  \\n\\n6.3 Cardiff Met expects that Deans of Schools (or the equivalent) will be responsible for:  \\n\\nEnsuring that researchers in their School are aware of this policy and their responsibilities in relation to it. Developing local level guidance and procedures in relation to research data management in support of the principles and expectations of this policy and disseminating these to all research staff within their School.  \\n\\n6.4 At institutional level, the University is responsible for:  \\n\\nProviding access to services and facilities for the storage, backup, deposit and retention of research data and records in order to enable researchers to meet the requirements of this policy and those of the funders of their research. Providing researchers with access to training, support and advice in research data management.  \\n\\n# Cardiff Metropolitan University Research Data Management Policy  \\n\\nProviding the necessary resources to the central services responsible for the provision of these services, facilities and training.  \\n\\n## 7. Implementation of this policy  \\n\\n7.1 This policy will be underpinned by a timeline of phased implementation which will take into account different levels of priority and will manage expectations against cost.  The timeline will include a programme of awareness raising and staff development.  In recognition that there is much progress to be made, the policy will be reviewed on an annual basis, at least for the duration of the underpinning timeline.',\n",
       " '# ICBM Research Data Management Policy  \\n\\n## Background & Motivation  \\n\\nData, records, and sample related information are fundamental to both high quality research and academic integrity: to verify and defend the process and outcomes of research, accurate and retrievable research data are essential. Increasing amounts of collected and produced raw data, as well as processed data, need to be retained in order to exploit their long-term value for research, teaching, and for wider exploitation for the public good.  \\n\\nThe purpose of data management is to maximise the academic value of research data by ensuring that such data is managed according to good practices for collection, curation, storage, management, retrieval, re-use, sharing, archiving, and access, appropriate for the data and discipline concerned.  \\n\\n## Objectives  \\n\\nThis policy defines research data as all data, records, and sample related information created or collected for the purposes of analysis to generate original research results. In accordance with the university guidelines for good scientific practice[1] and the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and thus Reusable (FAIR) principles[2], research data, regardless of the form or the media in which they may exist, should be  \\n\\naccurate, complete, authentic, and reliable, identifiable, retrievable, and available when needed, secure and safe, able to be made available to others.  \\n\\nResearch data should be retained  \\n\\na) as long as they are of continuing value to the researcher or the wider research community, b) as long as specified by the funding body, and   \\nc) for a minimum of ten years after publication.  \\n\\n### Responsibilities of Researchers  \\n\\nResearch data should be managed in accordance with the above principles and requirements. The principal investigator of a project is responsible for the data life-cycle. • Clear procedures for the collection, storage, use, re-use, access and retention of the research data should be developed and documented. This information should be incorporated, where appropriate, in a research data management plan (DMP). Such DMP should describe how the collection of data and metadata will be integrated into everyday research processes, so as to make compliance with the DMP as simple as possible. Researchers should plan the ongoing storage of their research data after the completion of the research as to how and where such data will be stored. Appropriate long-term archives include national or international subject-specific archives or a managed university repository.  \\n\\nRequirements concerning research data on the part of funding bodies must be met. This includes compliance with publication-ban, -restrictions, or -duty imposed by external contracting bodies, administrative regulations, and federal laws.  \\n\\n### Responsibilities of the ICBM  \\n\\nThe ICBM provides researchers with access to training, support, and advice on data management.   \\nThe ICBM provides access to services and facilities for the storage, backup, and deposit of research data.   \\n• The ICBM will build and maintain a central catalogue of metadata descriptions for indexing, archiving, naming, and retrieval of datasets.  \\n\\nAcknowledging that this is an aspirational policy, the ICBM intends that an evolutionary approach will be taken to fully implement this policy and related initiatives over a number of years. To this end, the ICBM establishes a data management team, which will organise, develop, and implement all necessary measures to fulfil the obligations of the ICBM.  \\n\\n## References  \\n\\n[1] Ordnung über die Grundsätze zur Sicherung guter wissenschaftlicher Praxis an der Carl von Ossietzky Universität vom 17.03.2017, Amtliche Mitteilungen 013/2017.     \\n[2] The FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship    \\n\\nSources: University of Oxford, Policy on the Management of Research Data and Records University of St Andrews, University Research Data Management Policy University of Edinburgh, Research Data Management Policy',\n",
       " '# Ethical Research Policy  \\n\\nThe purpose of the CEU Ethical Research Policy is to establish the principles and responsibilities for ethical conduct in research by the members of the CEU community and in research supported by CEU. As a research intensive university, CEU values and protects academic freedom while safeguarding ethical principles in research such as respect for persons and their welfare and justice.  \\n\\n1.  In accordance with its mission, CEU aims to uphold the highest standards of ethics in its research activities including research by the members of the CEU community (students, academic and administrative staff) as well as research supported by CEU (e.g. through research grants, providing facilities, administration, etc.).   \\n2.  CEU also aims to ensure that it does not receive or apply for research funding from inappropriate sources. The Policy and Guidelines on External academic funding at CEU regulates ethical considerations in seeking for and receiving external research funding.   \\n3. CEU is committed to protecting and respecting the privacy of individuals and safeguarding their personal information. When research affects personal data1, the relevant provisions of CEU’s Data Protection Policy of CEU shall also be applied.   \\n4. Each member of the CEU community, persons contracted by CEU (including visiting fellows), grantees and persons/entities performing outsourced research tasks on behalf of CEU or a CEU researcher should adhere to the Ethical Research Guidelines (G-1012-1) which lay out the main principles of ethical research in the social sciences, humanities and other relevant areas. Each of the above mentioned is responsible for identifying ethical issues potentially pertaining to his/her research. In the case of research co-funded or co-hosted by CEU, ethical research guidelines of the co-funding/co-hosting institution might also apply in addition to the provisions determined by CEU Ethical Research Policy.   \\n5. The CEU Ethical Research Committee (ERC) will compile a list of other ethical research boards whose reviews are recognized.   \\n6. As an institution, CEU works to keep its community members aware about research ethics.   \\n7. The overall responsibility for ethical research at CEU rests with the President and Rector and the Pro-Rector for Faculty and Research. The Heads of Departments, Programs and Research Centers are responsible for ethical research within their units, including research done by students. The Principal Investigators are responsible for ethical standards in the projects they lead.   \\n8. The CEU Ethical Research Committee (ERC) advises the Rector and the Pro-Rector for Faculty and Research on ethical issues pertaining to CEU research and oversees the implementation of CEU Ethical Research Policy and CEU Ethical Research Guidelines. The ERC can introduce minor technical changes into the Ethical Research Policy and the Ethical Research Guidelines.  \\n\\n9. The ERC is chaired by the   Pro-Rector for Faculty and Research or their appointee and includes at least three other members appointed by the Senate, one of whom may be an external academic with experience in handling ethical issues in research. The other members of the committee are chosen from among CEU academic staff members and senior administrative staff members with experience in research ethics in different disciplines. The ERC members are appointed for three years with the possibility of extension for another three-year term. The ERC establishes its own rules of operation (‘Ethical Research Committee: Operational Rules’, Annex 2 to Ethical Research Policy). The minutes of the ERC meetings, excluding the minutes from closed sessions, are available to all members of the CEU community upon request.  \\n\\n10. ERC can delegate responsibilities to appropriately established departmental/research unit Ethical Research Committees, especially when the nature of research within a specific area requires a separate committee. If the character of research makes it necessary, further legally applicable procedures can be followed by departments/research units under the supervision of the ERC or departmental/research unit Ethical Research Committees.  \\n\\n11. Ethical issues in all CEU research should be systematically identified with reference to the Research Ethics Guidelines and the Checklist on Ethical Issues in Research (‘Checklist’, Annex 3 to this Policy). Potential research ethics issues pertaining to research conducted at CEU should be identified, as a first instance, by the researcher(s) involved. Further procedures regarding the identification of ethical issues are specified in Ethical Research Committee: Operational Rules (see: Annex 2 to Ethical Research Policy).  \\n\\n12. In case ethical issues are identified in relation to a research project, the project design should be reviewed and approved by the relevant people or body. Further procedures for review and approval of research projects are specified in ERC Operational Rules.  \\n\\n13. The application for obtaining written endorsement of research by the ERC should be submitted in writing to the ERC using the Checklist on Ethical Issues in Research.  \\n\\n14. Endorsements of research are kept on file by the Academic Cooperation and Research Office.  \\n\\n15. CEU Ethical Research Policy contains special regulations in order to prevent any ethical misconduct. However, in case of any allegations regarding ethical misconduct, which, if established, would constitute a breach of CEU Code of Ethics, the provisions of the CEU Code of Ethics shall be applicable mutatis mutandis and, to the extent of any conflict, the provisions of the CEU Ethical Research Policy will apply and supersede CEU Code of Ethics.  \\n\\n## Annex 1 to the Ethical Research Policy  \\n\\n## Ethical research guidelines2  \\n\\nThe purpose of the CEU Ethical research guidelines is to establish the principles and responsibilities for ethical conduct in research by the members of the CEU Community and in research supported by CEU.  \\n\\n### 1. Good Research Practice  \\n\\n1.1 Research undertaken in accordance with recognized research ethical principles constitutes good research practice and this guidance should be read in conjunction with the CEU Ethical Research Policy (P-1012-1).  \\n\\n1.2 Upholding recognized ethical principles in research requires an acceptance of and respect for principles of integrity, honesty and openness and a commitment to intellectual honesty and personal responsibility. Research should also aim to benefit society and minimize social harm. Research involving participants must be undertaken to gain knowledge and understanding and avoid unnecessary repetition of existing knowledge.  \\n\\n1.3 Prior to, during and following the completion of research activities, researchers are expected to consider the ethical implications of their research and any of its consequences for the participants involved. Research must be undertaken in accordance with commonly agreed standards of good practice such as those defined in the Declaration of Helsinki and any other guidance or ethical principles of appropriate professional bodies relevant to specific areas of research. Researchers are expected to consider their research from the perspective of the participant.  \\n\\n1.4 No member of the CEU community should be compelled or compel others to undertake or participate in research that conflicts with either the researchers’ or the participants’ individual ethical principles.  \\n\\n### 2. Scope  \\n\\n2.1 These guidelines must apply to all research conducted under the auspices of the University that involves direct contact with participants, through their physical participation in research activities (invasive and non-invasive participation), that indirectly involves participants through their provision of data and that involves people on behalf of others (e.g. parents on behalf of children).  \\n\\n2.2 Researchers must be especially sensitive to the need to consider, respect and safeguard the wellbeing of particularly vulnerable participants of research including but not limited to children; those with physiological/psychological impairments; those dependant on the protection or in the care of others and those with limited knowledge of the language in which research is conducted.  \\n\\n2.3 These guidelines shall be interpreted in accordance with CEU’s Data Protection Policy which shall prevail in questions related to managing personal data not regulated in this Policy.  \\n\\n### 3. Protection of Researcher/Research Team  \\n\\nSome researchers will face a range of potential risks to their safety and the safety of their research team when conducting certain types of research for example a researcher may be required to enter potentially dangerous environments to question certain participants. Such issues need to be considered in the design and conduct of research and procedures must be adopted to minimize any risk to researchers. In addition, researchers must consult all appropriate health and safety guidelines and procedures relevant to their area of research before commencing work.  \\n\\n### 4. Protection of Participants.  \\n\\n4.1 Researchers have a responsibility to protect participants from any harm arising from research. Harm to participants may arise from undue stress through participation, loss of self esteem, psychological injury as well as physical harm. As a general rule, people participating in research must not be exposed to risks that are greater than or additional to those they encounter in their normal lifestyles.  \\n\\n4.2 If it is expected that harm, unusual discomfort or other negative consequences might occur in the prospective participant’s future life as a result of participating, the lead researcher must, prior to the person’s participation, obtain written consent of the participants.  \\n\\n4.3 Before participating, people must be informed of procedures for contacting the lead Head of the Ethical Research Committee within a reasonable time, if following participation they experience stress, harm or have related concerns.  \\n\\n4.4 In the case of interviews and questionnaires, the content and line of questioning may be highly sensitive, raise confidential, personal issues and intrude, or be perceived to intrude, upon a participant’s comfort and privacy. The initial judgment on whether or not questions are sensitive and likely to cause harm rests with a lead researcher. Researchers are encouraged to seek advice regarding these issues (for details about advisory bodies at CEU see Annex 2.).  \\n\\n### 5. Obtaining Consent  \\n\\nResearchers should normally carry out investigations with the valid consent of participants having taken all reasonable and practicable steps to ensure that they, or their authorized representatives, have adequately understood the nature of the research and any anticipated consequences. Under no circumstances must coercion be used to obtain a person’s consent to participate in research. Ideally consent should be obtained in writing but where this is not possible oral consent should be obtained.  \\n\\n#### 5.1 Informed Consent  \\n\\n5.1.1 Informed consent is a process by which a prospective participant, prior to participating in research:  \\n\\n(i) Is fully informed about all aspects of the research project, which might reasonably be expected to influence willingness to participate. In addition, the researcher must explain all other aspects of the research about which the prospective participants enquire. Such aspects will include some or all of the following:  \\n\\n• the nature and objectives of the project   \\n• the methodology of the project and conditions under which it is to be conducted   \\n• the persons/institutions that will have access to personally identifiable information about participants   \\n• the form in which research results will be published/communicated (e.g. aggregate statistical form)   \\n• who is undertaking and who is sponsoring the project   \\n• the potential risks and inconveniences that may arise   \\n• the potential benefits that may result • what participation in the research will require   \\n• whether it will be possible, and if yes, until what point, to withdraw from participation (ii) Freely and voluntarily gives consent to participating.  \\n\\n5.1.2 In case where, due to the nature of the research, informed consent is possible only after the researched situation is over, the researchers should obtain the consent as soon as the situation is over and when the participants do not consent the records of the situation should be destroyed in the presence of the participants.  \\n\\n5.1.3 Giving and obtaining consent can be a process, not always a one-off event and participants have the right to change their minds and withdraw consent at any time. However, if the withdrawal of consent occurs at the time when it affects the possibility of the finalization of the research (for instance, shortly before publication or thesis defense), the withdrawal should result only in the deletion of all personally identifiable data of the participant both in published materials and in stored and processed research data. If a researcher doubts whether a person participating in research still consents to participating s/he must clarify this with the person in question.  \\n\\n5.1.4 If the prospective participant is, for any reason, unable to understand the implications of participation, then the researcher is responsible for obtaining the informed consent of the parents/legal guardians of the prospective participant.  \\n\\n#### 5.2 Coercion  \\n\\n5.2.1 Where a relationship exists between the researcher and participant (e.g. employees, patients, students or anyone in a dependence relation) careful consideration as to the nature of consent is required. Willingness to volunteer may be unduly influenced by the expectation of benefits or rewards. When research is being conducted with detained persons (e.g. prisoners) particular care must be taken over informed consent, paying particular attention to the special circumstances that may affect the person’s ability to freely and voluntarily give informed consent.  \\n\\n5.2.2 People volunteering to participate in research may be paid for their inconvenience and time (taking into account the practices of a given academic discipline). Payments made to individuals must not be so large as to induce the individuals to risk harm beyond that which they would usually undertake. Financial payments might cover reimbursement for travel expenses and / or time. Risks resulting from participation must be acceptable to participants even in the absence of inducement.  \\n\\n5.2.3 The promise of compensation and care for damage, injury or loss of income as a result of participating in research activities to participants should not be considered coercion by inducement.  \\n\\n#### 5.3 Research Involving Incompetent Adults  \\n\\n5.3.1 Where a prospective participant is unable to give informed consent to participate a ‘legal representative’ may give assent on his/her behalf (in case of uncertainty the researchers should seek professional advice on the competence of participants). The person unable to give consent should still receive information according to their capacity to understand, setting out the risks and benefits of participating in the research.  \\n\\n5.3.2 In the case of an adult this could be a person designated by the adult, a relative or an independent person nominated by, for example, the hospital at which the research is being undertaken. If the adult has appointed a representative who is available, then this person must be used to give assent. A relative can only be used if the person has not appointed a representative or if the representative is not available. An independent person should only be used if both the adult’s representative and a relative are not available.  \\n\\n#### 5.4 Research Involving Children  \\n\\n5.4.1 Research involving children exists within both a legal framework and a more traditional context. The following guidance seeks to facilitate research involving children within a legal environment whilst respecting and taking into consideration the traditional and sometimes more formal guidance/procedures many settings may have. Laws of the country where the research takes place should be applied in determining whether participants in the research are children.  \\n\\n5.4.2 Parents (and others with parental responsibility) may agree to their children taking part in research, but where a child is able to understand sufficiently to give informed consent, their consent should be obtained in addition to parents’.  \\n\\n5.4.3 It is the researcher\\'s responsibility to assess whether the child has sufficient understanding to consent to the research. Children’s capacity to consent to research depends on their understanding of the research to be undertaken. Where information about the research and study can be given clearly and simply, it is possible for quite young children to consent to take part in research.  \\n\\n5.4.4 For a child to give valid consent they would need to understand the nature of the engagement with the researcher and understand that it is different to other interactions with those who may seek information from the child. Particularly, the child must be able to understand that the researcher is not able to make decisions about their life, and will use the information the child provides, but not in a way which would allow others to identify the child.  \\n\\n5.4.5 Where a researcher wishes to include children in a study whom he/she considers is not mature enough to decide about participation he/she must obtain the agreement of at least one person who has parental responsibility for the child before engaging them in any research activity.  \\n\\n5.4.6 Where children are considered competent by a researcher to participate they should be accorded the confidentiality as would an adult. There are however two areas of concern where the same level of confidentially cannot be promised to a child: where a child discloses that they are being seriously harmed or ill-treated, or where the researcher discovers a condition about which the parents could take action to benefit the child. In these instances researchers could be seen to have a duty of care to disclose such information to relevant third parties.  \\n\\n5.4.7 In the case of research in educational settings, any special school policies or procedures must be followed and efforts made to fully inform those responsible for children in these settings of the purpose and benefits of any proposed research with children.  \\n\\n#### 5.5 Research in Public Contexts and With Groups  \\n\\n5.5.1 In certain types of research obtaining consent from every individual participating is impractical or unfeasible (e.g. observing a large crowd or observing discussions on the internet). In such types of research researchers must ensure the following:  \\n\\n(i) That such research is only carried out in public contexts;   \\n(ii) That no details that could identify specific individuals are given in any reports on the research unless reporting on public figures acting in their public capacity (e.g. reporting a speech by a named individual);   \\n(iii) That unless those observed give their consent to be observed, observational research should only occur where those observed would expect to be observed by strangers.  \\n\\n5.5.2 The privacy and psychological well-being of people participating in observational research and people participating in research activities in which a researcher may actually be acting as a fellow  \\n\\nparticipant, for example as part of a wider group, must be respected. In such group based, participatory research activities the usual effort should be made to ensure that the group leader(s), or others in positions of responsibility, as well as other individuals of a group, are made aware that they participate in their activities with research purposes. If this \"open strategy\" is not pursued, the researcher must be able to make an explicit and convincing case why this was not done.  \\n\\n5.5.3 It is recognized that in certain types of observational research or organizational settings it may be more difficult to explain to people participating their right to withdraw at any stage. However, in such types of research, researchers are expected to make a reasonable attempt to do so.  \\n\\n#### 5.6 Research Involving Deception  \\n\\n5.6.1 In certain research disciplines (e.g. psychology), to ensure the viability of a piece of research, it is sometimes necessary to withhold information on the true objectives of the research from the people participating in it. In such types of research it is impossible to obtain informed consent from the participants. Wherever possible such research should be avoided and the Ethical Research Committee will pay particular attention to research involving deception. Where deception or the misleading of participants is considered necessary, the central principle to consider when deciding the ethical soundness of deception is the anticipated reaction of the participant once debriefed. If it is likely that the participant will be angry, or show unease once debriefed the research is likely to be deemed unacceptable.  \\n\\n5.6.2 However, when such research, requiring consent but not informed consent from participants, is judged to be necessary for the results of the research to be valid, researchers must exercise particular caution. In such circumstances the lead researcher has a special responsibility to: (i) Justify that alternative procedures to avoid the withholding of information or deliberate deception are not available and, if available, are not feasible for the research; (ii) Justify why the withholding of information, or an element of concealment or deception, is integral to the viability of the research.  \\n\\n#### 5.7 Research Involving Personal Data  \\n\\nIn all cases where personal data is collected, recorded, used, or managed in any other way during research, the relevant privacy rules of CEU’s Data Protection Policy shall be followed, as applicable.  \\n\\n### 6. Debriefing  \\n\\nDebriefing does not provide a justification for unethical aspects of research but is rather a means for researchers to discuss with participants their experience of the research and to monitor any unforeseen negative effects or misconceptions. Debriefing is particularly important where any form of deception has been used and researchers have a responsibility to ensure that participants have received any necessary debriefing in the form of active intervention before they leave the research setting.  \\n\\n### 7. Research conducted in cross-cultural contexts  \\n\\n7.1 Researchers should bear in mind the differences between civil, legal and often the financial positions of national and foreign researchers and participants and must be aware that there may be a number of national laws which can affect the conduct of their research. 7.2 Researchers should endeavour to balance professional integrity with respect for national and international law in the context of their research.  \\n\\n7.3 Researchers should endeavour to ensure that research is conducted with respect for underrepresented social groups and that attempts are made to avoid their marginalization or exclusion. 7.4 Researchers should endeavour to ensure that the concerns of relevant stakeholders and user groups are addressed.  \\n\\n### 8. Confidentiality, Anonymity and Privacy  \\n\\n8.1 The collection, storage, disclosure and use of personal data by researchers must comply with all legislation relating to data protection and arrangements must be put in place by researchers to carefully protect the confidentiality of participants and their data. Details that would allow individuals to be identified must not be published or made available to anybody not involved in the research unless explicit consent is given by the individuals concerned.  \\n\\n8.2 Before consent is obtained, researchers must inform prospective participants of:   \\n(i) Risks regarding the confidentiality of personal data and data revealed during research when the information is gathered in the presence of other participants (e.g. focus groups);   \\n(ii) Any potential risks that might mean that the confidentiality or anonymity of personal data may not be guaranteed;   \\n(iii) Which individuals and organizations, if any, will be permitted access to personal data, and under what circumstances such access will be granted;   \\n(iv) The purpose for which personal information provided is to be used (e.g. if video material might be used for teaching purposes).  \\n\\n8.3 If it is necessary, in undertaking research, to identify participants explicitly, then the researchers must explain why this is the case and how confidentiality will be protected. Researchers must be aware of the risks to anonymity, confidentiality and privacy posed by all kinds of personal information storage and processing which directly identify a person (e.g. audio and videotapes, electronic and paper-based files, e-mail records). 3 Measures to prevent accidental breaches of confidentiality must be taken, and in cases where confidentiality is threatened, relevant records should be destroyed. Provisions for data security at the end of a project must be made.  \\n\\n8.4 Guarantees of confidentiality and anonymity given to research participants must be honored, unless there are clear and overriding reasons to inform appropriate third parties (e.g. cases of child abuse, where an uninvolved 3rd party may be at risk through the participant’s actions or where a possibility of the participant’s self-harm is revealed during the research). All participants have the right to access personal information, whether or not it is confidential, that relates to them, and to be provided with a copy of the information on request (all participants have to be made aware of the process and researcher(s) responsible for providing the information). People should have the right, following the completion of their period of involvement in the research and following discussions with the researcher, to withdraw their consent and to require that their own data be destroyed, if practicable and unless the withdrawal jeopardizes the research at its final stages (see also: 5.1.2).  \\n\\n### 9. Funding from External Sources  \\n\\n9.1 CEU supports and encourages its staff to seek external funding for their research activities and accepts funding for research from a wide and diverse portfolio of legal sources, in accordance with University financial regulations and ethical research principles laid down in CEU Ethical Research Policy (P-1012-1) and in this document. All applications and proposals made, and contracts and awards accepted relating to external research funding, are done so on behalf of and in the name of CEU.  \\n\\n9.2 However, it is recognized that there may be circumstances where ethical issues can arise when considering whether or not to apply for or accept funding for research from particular sources. It is important that the interests of all CEU community members and the interests and the reputation of the University as a whole are safeguarded when seeking and accepting external funding.  \\n\\n9.3 The principles and procedures for considering ethical issues when applying for external research funding are laid out in the Policy on External Funding for Academic Activities at CEU (P0805- 01v1202).  \\n\\nFurther sources:  \\n\\nAn EU Code of Ethics for Socio-Economic Research:   \\n    \\nPanel on Research Ethics, Government of Canada:   \\n    \\nGuidance for Research Ethics in the Social Sciences, Law and the Humanities:   \\n    \\nmanities.pdf  \\n\\n## Annex 2 to the Ethical Research Policy  \\n\\n### Ethical Research Committee: Operational Rules  \\n\\nAll research at CEU (by members of CEU community and research supported by CEU) is expected to accord with recognized ethical research principles. Two CEU official documents safeguard that the expectations are met – CEU Ethical Research Policy and CEU Ethical Research Guidelines, the first of which specifies general principles and responsibilities related to ethical research while the second lays down the specific principles that the researcher(s) must abide by in their study.  \\n\\nThis annex regulates the operation of the CEU Ethical Research Committee and procedures that researchers at CEU need to observe regarding the evaluation and review of their research.  \\n\\n### Rules of Operation of ERC  \\n\\n#### 1. Decisions  \\n\\nQuorum is two-thirds; decisions by ERC are taken by simple majority.  \\n\\n2. Raising awareness on ethical issues in research  \\n\\n(a) All academic staff members whose research can involve ethical issues, and staff members directly involved in administering such research, are required to undertake an online research ethics training and familiarization module, identified by the ERC, once every five years.  \\n\\n(b) Some academic disciplines require that ethical research training be a part of standard academic training in the discipline. The heads of CEU departments/research centers/schools report to the Chair of the ERC on the issue as necessary. In cases where ethical research training is part of the expected and practiced skills of the discipline, researchers from the department need not complete the ethical research training.  These researchers are however encouraged to undertake the online research ethics training module as a way of renewing their existing skills set.  \\n\\n(d) Students whose work involves ethical issues and who do not receive adequate training on these issues in other form, e.g. as part of their courses are also asked to complete the training (see also below in 5.1).  \\n\\n#### 3. Persons/bodies at CEU with a responsibility to identify ethical issues in research  \\n\\nThe ERC constitutes the highest instance regarding the identification of ethical issues and ethical review of research at CEU. In addition, the following persons/bodies may be involved in the identification/review process:  \\n\\n#### 3.1 Master’s/PhD Dissertations/Research:  \\n\\nAcademic supervisors;   \\nHeads of Departments/Programs;   \\nAcademic program committees (e.g. Departmental Doctoral Committees); specialized Ethical Research Committees4;   \\nDissertation committees;  \\n\\n3.2 Research conducted by/headed by Academic Staff Members:  \\n\\nPrincipal researcher(s) responsible for a research project;   \\nHeads of Academic Units;   \\nSpecialized Ethical Research Committees;   \\nAcademic Cooperation and Research Support Office (ACRO);  \\n\\n#### 4. Identification of ethical research issues and the need for a review  \\n\\n(a) The Checklist on Ethical Issues in Research is the basic instrument in identifying ethical issues. It is strongly advised that researchers use the Checklist as a guide for the research already in its designing/planning stage, so that possible violations of Ethical Research Policy and Ethical Research Guidelines are avoided.  \\n\\n(b) Every researcher at CEU should, before signing a contract with CEU, receive all the relevant documents relating to ethical issues in research (Ethical Research Policy, Ethical Research Guidelines, Operational Rules of the ERC, the Checklist on Ethical Issues in Research). All contracts signed with CEU should contain a clause: “I have received all the relevant documents related to the ethical issues in research and will abide by the rules laid down in these documents”.  \\n\\n#### 4.1 Master’s/PhD Dissertations  \\n\\n(a) Identification of ethical research issues in Master’s thesis/PhD dissertation projects is the responsibility of the student and his/her supervisor(s).  \\n\\nThe following are applicable only if any ethical research issue is identified in the thesis/: (b) Unless there is another well-established disciplinary practice of addressing ethical issues in research, students and supervisors are advised to consult and use the Checklist on Ethical Issues in Research as a basis of identifying and addressing ethical issues.  \\n\\n(c) If there are research ethics issues involved in the student’s work, supervisors should make sure that the student receives some form of training in this field. The training could be a component of research or methods courses which are part of the curriculum.  Supervisors or Academic Unit Heads may wish to ask students to complete the online ethical research training module described in Point 2 in lieu of ethical research training in the Unit.  .  \\n\\n(d) Departments/Programs may decide to make the submission and discussion of a completed Checklist a Prospectus Seminar requirement for thesis/dissertations/research proposals in which ethical issues were identified. It is within the authority of Departmental/Programs’ authorities to make the Checklist on Ethical Issues in Research an integral part of the dissertation.  \\n\\n(e) Departmental/Program Committees may conduct random checks of dissertations and student work in progress with regards to the identification of ethical issues and reviews with regards to the compliance with Ethical Research Guidelines.  \\n\\n#### 4.2 Research conducted by academic staff  \\n\\n(a) Identification of ethical research issues in research projects is the responsibility of the principal researcher(s) of the project. If potential issues are identified, the Checklist on Ethical Issues in Research should be completed and filed so that it can be produced upon request by the ERC. If there are no ethical issues, there is no need to fill in the Checklist.  \\n\\n(b) Researchers may request consultations with other persons/bodies at CEU on ethical research issues in the order indicated in ‘Research by Academic Staff Members’ of section 3.2 above  \\n\\n(c) The ERC may conduct random ethical reviews of research projects. In those cases, the principal investigator(s) should produce the Checklist and all other relevant material for review as required. The specialised Committees appointed can also conduct random reviews in their field.  \\n\\n(d) All research projects by the CEU academic staff which receive either external funding or targeted funding from CEU should file a completed Checklist with the ACRO if ethical issues are identified in the project. In accordance with Point (c) above, the ERC may conduct random checks on these projects.  \\n\\n(e) If a research proposal fails to meet ethical standards required, the funding of the project may be refused or suspended. (g) When an external funding body requires an ethical research review of the research project, ACRO upon completing the documents forwards the request to the ERC for review.  \\n\\n#### 5. Review process  \\n\\n(a) For review purposes, ERC maintains a list of potential reviewers, updated at the beginning of every academic year, both from among CEU academic staff members and academics not affiliated with CEU, with expertise relevant for determining issues in research ethics.  \\n\\n(b) Researchers applying for the ethical research review by ERC should submit the research proposal, the Checklist on Ethical Issues in Research, with the section on requesting a review filled in as appropriate, to the Chair of the ERC at least two months before the commencement of the research. The results of the review should be communicated to the researcher(s) in time for the start of the research.  \\n\\n(c) The Chair of the ERC will ask a member of the Committee to recommend reviewers for the proposal. The Committee member proposes two persons from the list of reviewers and/or from among the members of the ERC to serve as reviewers. The reviewers are asked to check the compliance of the research project with ethical standards.  \\n\\n(d) The review reports are submitted to the Chair of the ERC, and if amendments are proposed by the reviewers, these are conveyed to the applicant. Research proposals can be amended twice, and if necessary, reviewers are asked to check if amendments sufficiently address the concerns raised.  \\n\\n(e) The Chair of the ERC makes a decision about the acceptance or refusal of proposals, taking into account the reviewers’ opinion and the compliance of the applicants with suggestions to amend the project.  \\n\\n(f) If continued supervision of the project is needed then, when possible, one of the reviewers is appointed and when not, the Chair of the ERC appoints a supervisor from the list of potential reviewers.  \\n\\n(g) In the case that an ethical research review is carried out by another Committee, to which such responsibilities had been delegated by the ERC in line with Point 10 of the Ethical Research Policy, the researchers have a responsibility to notify the Chair of the ERC and file the review results with ACRO.  \\n\\n## Annex 3 to the Ethical Research Policy  \\n\\n### Checklist on Ethical Issues in Research  \\n\\nThis Checklist is intended as a guide for CEU students/researchers in planning, designing and carrying out research, and for applying approval to the Ethical Research Committee. The numbers in brackets indicate the relevant Points of the Guidelines on Ethical Research. When applying for approval from the Ethical Research Committee, please provide explanatory answers that enable the ERC to assess whether the Guidelines were followed.  \\n\\n#### A.

       " '# Charles University Research Data Policy  \\n\\n## 1. Preamble  \\n\\nCharles University is committed to ensuring that its research is transparent, replicable and its research results are widely accessible and reusable, in line with the principle ‘as open as possible, as closed as necessary’. The University strongly believes that such practice improves the quality of research and benefits not only the wider research community but individual researchers as well by fostering collaboration and increasing their impact. Making research results widely available will further highlight the excellence of the University’s\\xa0research and enable public engagement.  \\n\\nThe University recognizes that research data are an integral part of the research process and that research data management is a\\xa0key component of research quality and integrity. The aim is for the University researchers to produce research data that are managed in accordance with the FAIR principles.  \\n\\n## 2. Definitions  \\n\\nResearch data: Research data can be\\xa0characterised\\xa0as any information that has been collected, observed, generated, or created to validate or reproduce research findings. Research data can take various forms, including but not limited to documents, spreadsheets, images, audio and video recordings, code, software, laboratory notebooks or samples, and may be digital as well as non-digital.  \\n\\nMetadata: Metadata provide information about other data. They may include, for example, information about who the author of the data is, or when and where the data were created.  \\n\\nFAIR principles: The FAIR principles describe how research data should be organised so they can be more\\xa0Findable,\\xa0Accessible,\\xa0Interoperable and\\xa0Reusable.  \\n\\nData management plan (DMP): Data management plan (DMP) is a\\xa0document that specifies what data will be created and how, and outlines the plans for sharing and preservation of the data, both during and after the research project. DMP should be updated regularly to reflect what actually happened with the data.  \\n\\nRepository: Repository is a\\xa0digital online storage for storing and sharing the results of creative activities (e.g., publications or data).  \\n\\nPersistent identifier: Persistent identifier is a\\xa0long-lasting reference to a\\xa0unique entity. Persistent identifiers may be used, for example, for digital objects (e.g., DOI, handle), researchers (e.g., ORCID, ResearcherID), organisations (e.g., ROR) or other entities.  \\n\\nResearcher: Under this policy, the term researcher includes all members of the University, including staff and students, and affiliated persons who conduct research at or on behalf of the University.  \\n\\nPrincipal investigator: Principal investigator is a\\xa0researcher with an overall responsibility for a\\xa0research project.a\\xa0další entity.  \\n\\n## 3. Aim  \\n\\nThe purpose of this policy is to specify the basic principles of research data management regarding data collection, storage, preservation and sharing of research data. Furthermore, the policy aims to delineate the responsibilities of the University and its researchers in terms of managing research data. The policy also provides information on available institutional support that researchers may use to meet the standards set out in the policy. The University acknowledges that there are various discipline specific norms across the diverse spectrum of research, thus the policy does not obligate researchers to use prescribed tools when working with research data. The aim is to promote good practice in research data management and provide guidance to researchers. The policy may be complemented by Faculty guidelines that take into account local environment, infrastructure and discipline specific norms.  \\n\\n## 4. Scope  \\n\\nThe policy applies to all University employees and students, and affiliated persons and subjects conducting or supporting research at the University. The policy applies to all research data regardless of their form.  \\n\\n## 5. Basic principles  \\n\\nResearch data will be managed to a\\xa0high standard throughout the research data lifecycle. Researchers will make every reasonable effort to manage their research data in accordance with FAIR principles. Research data collection, processing and sharing must not infringe on Intellectual Property Rights, General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Act on Cyber Security, and must be in compliance with other legal, institutional and contractual requirements.  \\n\\n### 5.1 Data collection and storage  \\n\\nResearch data are to be stored in a\\xa0secure location to prevent unauthorised access or data loss, following the methodological guidance on data security. Where possible, research data should be accompanied by rich metadata using standardised vocabularies and should be stored in standard formats in order to increase their interoperability. If there is an exchange of personal data with a\\xa0third party where the University is the data exporter, an agreement must be drawn up to ensure the data are protected.  \\n\\nWhen conducting research involving external partners, researchers are advised to draw up an agreement that specifies rights and responsibilities of the involved parties, regarding, for example, intellectual property rights and licensing, or responsibilities in relation to research data management.  \\n\\nResearchers are advised to prepare a\\xa0data management plan for their research projects to ensure the data are complete, accurate, reliable, and secure. Data management plans should be updated regularly to reflect what actually happened with the data.  \\n\\n### 5.2 Data preservation  \\n\\nResearch data that serve as a\\xa0basis for a\\xa0publication are to be retained for a\\xa0period of minimum 10 years since the day the research results are published, so that the results may be verified. If it is necessary to delete some data earlier, for example due to contractual obligations, this information is to be provided in the documentation. Researchers are encouraged to retain their research data for as long as feasible. Research data that are being preserved are to be accompanied with sufficient documentation to ensure they can be easily interpreted.  \\n\\n### 5.3 Data sharing  \\n\\nResearch data should be made available for access and reuse as widely as feasible, in accordance with the principle “as open as possible, as closed as necessary”. When researchers share their data, they should adhere to the following principles.  \\n\\nResearch data are to be shared along with rich metadata to provide sufficient   \\ninformation on their provenance and to increase their findability and reusability.   \\nMetadata of shared data include references, via persistent identifiers, to other related outputs and entities.   \\nResearch data should be assigned a\\xa0persistent identifier.   \\nResearch data should be shared via a\\xa0trusted repository or a\\xa0suitable platform that is established within the research field.   \\nIn compliance with intellectual property rights, research data should be assigned an appropriate license in order to clearly specify the conditions for reuse, unless funder requirements, statutory or contractual obligations provide otherwise. It is recommended to use open licenses such as Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY).   \\nWhere appropriate, published research should include a\\xa0data availability statement  \\n\\nwhich outlines how the underlying data may be accessed.  \\n\\n## 6. Responsibilities  \\n\\nIn order to enable the policy, the responsibilities of the University and the researchers are as follows.  \\n\\n### 6.1 Responsibilities of the researcher  \\n\\nResearchers are responsible for managing their research data in accordance with the basic principles outlined in this policy.   \\nWhen undergraduate and postgraduate students participate in research, the Principal Investigator or supervisor is obliged to introduce them to the basic principles of research data management. The students have a\\xa0personal responsibility to contribute to effective data management of the data they work with.   \\nResearchers are obliged to comply with the Code of Ethics, General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Act on Cyber Security, and with other legal, institutional   \\nor contractual requirements.   \\nWhen reusing or referencing datasets, researchers are obliged to follow proper   \\ncitation guidelines.   \\nResearchers are obliged to allocate appropriate resources for data management in research proposals and grant applications.   \\nWhen researchers find themselves unable to fulfil the requirements set out in this policy due to a\\xa0failure of the University to provide appropriate resources or support, they should contact   \\nthe University support team (researchdata@cuni.cz) or the Department of Science and Research (veda@ruk.cuni.cz) to obtain additional advice or support.  \\n\\n### 6.2 Responsibilities of the University  \\n\\nThe University is responsible for disseminating information about the obligations of researchers with respect to research data management. Faculties, Research Institutes and Departments are expected to be proactive in disseminating the information within their communities.   \\nThe University will provide suitable infrastructure and services to ensure that researchers can comply with the requirements under this policy.   \\nThe University will provide training and guidance to promote best practice in research data management.   \\nThe University will provide information and advice on issues related to all aspects of research data management, including research ethics, Intellectual Property Rights, or data protection.   \\nThe University commits to engage with the research community to discuss the needs of the community in terms of support and infrastructure.  \\n\\n## 7. Available support  \\n\\nThe Open Science Support Centre manages a\\xa0website (  which provides guidance on best practices in research data management, including information on FAIR data, data collection and storage, data preservation and data sharing as outlined in this policy.  \\n\\nThe following departments provide support with research data management:  \\n\\nResearch data management: Open Science Support Centre (researchdata@cuni.cz)   \\nIT support: Computer Science Centre (openict@cuni.cz)   \\nLegal advice –\\t Copyright: Open Science Support Centre (openlaw@cuni.cz) Commercialisation of Intellectual Property: Charles University Innovations Prague a.s.

       " '# Guideline on Research Data Management  \\n\\nKiel University’s Recommendations on Handling Research Data  \\n\\nUniversity Board Resolution of 14 July 20151  \\n\\nResearch data are the basis and result of scientific work and are therefore of particular significance. It is important to handle research data responsibly to ensure that scientific work is traceable, verifiable and reusable. Handling research data is subject to constant change due to advances in research. Kiel University continuously assists with this ongoing process by implementing appropriate measures. Accordingly, appropriate subject-specific handling of research data at Kiel University should follow these principles:  \\n\\n1. Research data are all data created in the process of research work through observation, collection, experiments, simulation, and further processing for the purpose of producing and validating research results. Research data management, therefore, covers all areas of data administration: data acquisition, data preservation, data security and data integrity, as well as the release and publication of data.   \\n2. Research data management is performed in accordance with current professional standards while respecting the DFG (German Research Foundation) proposals for safeguarding good scientific practice and is documented in a data management plan. The responsibility for research data management lies with the head of the particular research activity.   \\n3. Research data is made accessible to the public in national or international subjectspecific archives under appropriate licensing; if no such archives exist, central university services are used. The scientific and legal interests of the researchers, the protection of the personal details of participants, patients and other individuals affected by the collected data, as well as other obligations to third parties – for example, cooperation partners – as well as ethical, legal and economic restrictions must be observed.  \\n\\nKiel University assists researchers through its central infrastructure facilities with offers for acquisition and preservation of research data, formulating and maintaining standards for handling research data, as well as appropriate training and advisory service offers created in cooperation with the specialist disciplines. Kiel University recommends and assists with anchoring the significance of subject-specific, structured research data management in teaching by the particular subject areas.',\n",
       " '# CBS Research Data Management Policy  \\n\\n## 1. Preface  \\n\\n### 1.1 Purpose  \\n\\nCopenhagen Business School (CBS) envisions itself as a “world-leading business university” that contributes to society with academically excellent research and research-based education. Academic excellence presupposes trustworthiness and high integrity, i.e. honesty, transparency, and accountability of research, as stated in the Danish Code of Conduct for Research Integrity.  \\n\\nResearch data management ensures honest, transparent, and accountable research practices. Therefore, CBS encourages researchers to manage their data according to the FAIR-principles, thus making them findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable.3  \\n\\nCBS and the individual researchers share responsibilities to comply with the principles of responsible and FAIR research data management outlined in this policy. The policy specifies in more detail the obligations of both the institution and the researchers.  \\n\\n### 1.2 Scope  \\n\\nThis policy applies to staff, students, emeriti, visiting researchers, as well as honorary and adjunct appointees involved in research activities at CBS (in the following referred to as researchers).  \\n\\nThis policy applies to research data that have been collected and/or used during CBS research activities, including primary materials, data, records, and datasets, in all formats and media.  \\n\\n## 2. Definitions  \\n\\nAccording to the Danish Code of Conduct for Research Integrity Research the term of research data contains two elements: primary materials and data.  Primary materials and data are defined as:  \\n\\nPrimary material is any material (e.g. biological material, notes, interviews, texts and literature, digital recordings, etc.) that forms the basis of the research.  \\n\\nData are the detailed records of the primary materials that comprise the basis for the analysis that generates the results.  \\n\\nResearch data management comprises the processes of collecting, processing, analysing, storing, sharing, long-term preserving, and disposing of research data. The key purpose of research data management is to ensure honest, transparent, and accountable research practices.  \\n\\nThe CBS Research Data Management Policy covers all kinds of primary materials and data relevant for CBS Research, but does not cover primary materials such as biological materials etc. Published and publicly available literature is considered as important primary material that is to be treated in accordance with the principles for Responsible Conduct. However, published and publicly available literature are exempted from the CBS Research Data Management Policy, and thereby not covered by its rules and recommendations.  \\n\\n## 3. Division of responsibilities in the research data life cycle  \\n\\nCBS acknowledges the importance of responsible research data management according to the FAIRprinciples (see Preface). Data management responsibilities are shared between the researchers and CBS. In the following, they are described according to the research data lifecycle depicted in Figure 1.  \\n\\n  \\nFigure 1: Research Data Lifecycle (by DTU AIS Bibliometrics and Data Management - licensed under CC0 1.0)  \\n\\n### 3.1 Research Planning  \\n\\nCBS will support good research data management practices by providing information, education, and training opportunities for all CBS researchers.  \\n\\n#### 3.1.1  Legal framework  \\n\\nResearchers must adhere to Danish legislation and CBS regulations, and they must obtain the appropriate approvals, e.g. ethical approvals, to be kept with the research data as long as they exist.  \\n\\nCBS provides researchers with information regarding the legal requirements underlying research data management.  \\n\\nResearchers must acquaint themselves with legal requirements concerning the use of personal data and other classified information for research purposes, before data collection starts. Researchers must register projects involving personal data with CBS Legal that administer the umbrella license that the Danish Data Protection Agency (Datatilsynet) has issued to CBS regarding the use of personal data for scientific and statistical purposes.  \\n\\nResearchers must complete a notification form regarding their use of personal data in a research project. CBS Legal will sign the completed form, assign a case number, and enter the project into the record of research projects that CBS is obliged to keep in accordance with the umbrella license.  \\n\\nCBS Legal provides guidance on all questions concerning processing of personal data for research purposes.  \\n\\n#### 3.1.2  Entitlements  \\n\\nEntitlements comprise rights of ownership, access, disposal, and use relating to research data as defined by Danish legislation or contracts and agreements. Entitlements may vary according to the specifics of the research project in question, for instance, whether data is collected or captured by the researcher on his/her own or whether data is bought or licensed in connection with the project.  \\n\\nIt is recommended to clarify entitlements for all collaborative research projects with external partners either from national and international public or private universities or from firms, and if necessary, to document the clarification by written agreement.  \\n\\nIt is recommended to clarify entitlements for all externally funded research projects.  \\n\\nFurthermore, it is important to clarify entitlements when the researcher conducts research in the course of the employment with CBS without external funding.  \\n\\nThe clarification and a potential written agreement should take into account, among other things, who owns the data, how the data can be used in relation to the specific research project for which the data was initially collected, and how the data can be used and accessed upon completion of the research project.  \\n\\nResearchers should, especially in relation to collaborative research projects, clarify, and if necessary, document by written agreement all entitlements to research data in compliance with Danish legislation and CBS regulations.  \\n\\nCBS Legal negotiates all third party contracts containing regulations on intellectual property rights, such as Non-Disclosure Agreements, Collaboration Agreements and other agreements related to CBS research projects.  \\n\\nCBS Legal provides guidance on all questions concerning entitlements to research data.  \\n\\nCBS Library provides guidance on all questions concerning use of commercial data services and providers.  \\n\\n#### 3.1.3  Data Management Plan (DMP)  \\n\\nResearchers must ensure that research data are managed according to best practice within their field. CBS encourages researchers to write a Data Management Plan (DMP) following the research data lifecycle (Figure 1). If no other specific requirements apply, e.g. funders’ requirements, it is recommended to include as a minimum:  \\n\\nOrigin and type of the research data that will be created and used throughout the project Data documentation and metadata, data storage, backup, and sharing during the active research phase Data selection for long-term preservation, data disposal, and data access management Description of the roles and responsibilities with regard to the above processes  \\n\\nResearchers should regularly update the DMP throughout the research data lifecycle and keep a copy of the DMP with the research data as long as they exist.  \\n\\nTemplates for DMPs will be provided on CBSshare and will be regularly updated by CBS Research Data Management Support.  \\n\\nCBS Research Data Management Support provides guidance on all questions concerning Data Management Plans (DMPs).  \\n\\n### 3.2 Active State of Research  \\n\\n#### 3.2.1  Collecting and processing research data  \\n\\nResearchers should document the data collection process and subsequent data processing according to best practice within their field. This includes, among others things:  \\n\\nClearly and accurately describing the project methodology   \\nChoosing data formats, hardware and software solutions that are widely adopted within   \\ntheir field and deemed durable   \\nDescribing data quality assurance processes  \\n\\nData documentation reports allow research results to be assessed, research procedures to be retraced and, if relevant, the research to be reproduced. Data documentation reports should be stored together with the research data as long as they exist.  \\n\\nMetadata facilitate searching for and identifying research data. Researchers should describe all research data with appropriate metadata according to best practice within their field. Metadata should be linked to the research data as long as they exist.  \\n\\nCBS IT is responsible for offering appropriate software solutions in cooperation with the system owner of the relevant IT systems.  \\n\\nCBS Research Data Management Support provides guidance on all questions concerning data documentation and metadata.  \\n\\n#### 3.2.2  Storing research data  \\n\\nResearchers must adhere to CBS Information Security Policy, CBS Information Security Rules, and CBS Information Security Instructions.7 This includes, among other things:  \\n\\nData storage   \\nData backup   \\nData sharing in collaborative research   \\nAccess control management  \\n\\nCBS must provide a storage system that allows researchers to manage their research data responsibly. Such a storage system includes storage space, backup, and access control. In addition to locally provided storage facilities and network infrastructures, CBS provides a regularly updated list of trusted data repositories and approved cloud services for data sharing purposes.  \\n\\nCBS IT provides guidance and support concerning information security:  \\n\\nCBS Research Data Management Support provides guidance on trusted data repositories and approved cloud services.  \\n\\n### 3.3 Sharing Results  \\n\\n#### 3.3.1  Access to research data  \\n\\nResearchers are responsible for managing access to the research data after the completion of the research project. If they make the research data available for reuse, researchers must clearly communicate the terms and conditions for reuse where and whenever appropriate, e.g. by use of appropriate licenses.  \\n\\nCBS encourages researchers to make research data openly accessible according to the FAIRprinciples (see Preface), except when this is in conflict with contractual obligations, existing regulations on e.g. ethical, confidentiality or privacy matters, or intellectual property rights.  \\n\\nCBS Research Data Management Support provides guidance on open access to research data.  \\n\\nCBS Legal provides guidance on contractual legal obligations, immaterial rights, etc. in connection with open access to research data.  \\n\\n#### 3.3.2  Long-term preservation of research data  \\n\\nWhen the research project ends, researchers should prepare the research data for long-term storage. This includes among other things:  \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Data selection: Researchers should archive all research data of high value (costly or difficult to replace), unless Danish legislation states otherwise. Researchers are encouraged to archive research data that could help defend their research against possible challenges. Data disposal: Researchers should plan for appropriate disposal of research data that are not selected for long-term preservation. Data disposal has to take place in accordance with CBS Information Security Policy, CBS Information Security Rules, and CBS Information Security Instructions.8 Long-term preservation: In accordance with the Danish Code of Conduct for Research Integrity , researchers must ensure that research data selected for long-term preservation remain archived for a minimum of five years after project completion. Researchers working with personal data must archive their research data at the Danish National Archives (Rigsarkivet), unless Danish legislation states that the research data must be destroyed upon project completion.  \\n\\nCBS IT provides guidance and support concerning safe data disposal.  \\n\\nCBS Research Data Management Support provides guidance on trusted data repositories and on archiving data at the National Archives (Rigsarkivet).',\n",
       " \"# Research Services Directorate  \\n\\nPolicy on Managing Research Data at DMU  \\n\\n## Policy on Managing Research Data at DMU  \\n\\n# CONTENTS  \\n\\nIntroduction .. 3   \\nScope.. 3   \\nPolicy Statements . 4   \\nDMU Researchers' Responsibilities. 6   \\nDMU’s Responsibilities . 7   \\nEnforcement.. 7   \\nDefinitions .  \\n\\n## INTRODUCTION  \\n\\n1. De Montfort University is committed to research excellence and integrity and seeks to promote high standards of research data management throughout the research data lifecycle.  The University is working towards compliance with the principles of the UK Concordat on Open Research Data and believes that making data ‘as open as possible, as closed as necessary’ (European Commission FAIR Data Guidelines 2016) is key to research transparency, integrity and engagement.  \\n\\n2. This document sets out our policy on Open Research Data and on the management of data in the research lifecycle in accordance with funder requirements, and supersedes and replaces DMU’s ‘Guidelines for Managing Research Data’. It should be read alongside the following policies:  \\n\\nGuidelines for Good Research Practice Policy on Conducting Sensitive Research Data Protection DMU Figshare Terms & Conditions Faculty-specific Guidelines for Research Ethics  \\n\\n## SCOPE  \\n\\n3. This policy applies to all DMU staff who undertake academic research, as well as postgraduate research students, external consultants, visitors and contractors conducting research at or on behalf of the University (collectively referred to as ‘DMU researchers’), whether externally funded or not, unless otherwise indicated.  \\n\\n4. The term ‘research data’ refers to the evidence that underpins the answer to the research question and can be used to validate findings, regardless of its form (e.g. print, digital or physical).  These might include quantitative information or qualitative statements collected by researchers in the course of their work by experimentation, observation, modelling, interview or other methods, or information derived from existing evidence. They may include (but are not limited to) statistics, collections of digital images, sound recordings, transcripts of interviews, survey data, fieldwork notes, artwork, archives, found objects, published texts or manuscripts.  The primary purpose of research data is to provide the information necessary to support or validate a research project’s observations, findings or outputs (Concordat on Open Research Data, 2016).  \\n\\n5. Open research data are those research data that can be freely accessed, used, modified and shared, provided that there is appropriate acknowledgement, where required (Concordat on Open Research Data, 2016).  \\n\\n6. All research data created by DMU researchers are the intellectual property of the University, unless subject to a grant, contract or other legally binding agreement signed by the University that stipulates otherwise.  For the avoidance of doubt, where legislative requirements apply, those legislative requirements will take precedence over this policy.  \\n\\n7. All new research proposals for external funding must include research data management plans or protocols (DMPs) in line with the relevant funders’ policies (bearing in mind that some funders may require a DMP to be in place even if they do not ask for it to be submitted to them).  DMPs are also encouraged for research that is not externally funded, in order to enable cross-checking and validation, and support research integrity.  Additionally, it may be the case that individual Faculty Ethics Committees might require a DMP to be submitted with ethics applications.  \\n\\n8. All DMPs should include responsibilities for data collection, documentation and metadata, ethical and legal compliance, storage and backup, selection of data of long-term value, preservation and data sharing.  \\n\\n9. DMPs should ensure that research data are available for access and re-use wherever appropriate and with appropriate safeguards. For example, where the openness of data is restricted as outlined in sections 16 and 17, it may be that metadata is still made available and data sharing for re-use agreed with specific individuals/organisations under an appropriate legal agreement such as a data sharing agreement or a non-disclosure agreement. This would need to be detailed in the DMP.  \\n\\n10. All research data of continuing value to the researcher and/or wider research community, or specified by funding bodies or publishers, or required for legal or other regulatory purposes, must be made openly available unless restrictions apply (see sections 16 and 17).  \\n\\na. In the case of digital data, this may be achieved by depositing data to a specific domain repository (see section 11 below), or to the University data repository at     \\nb. In the case of non-digital data, this may be achieved by digitising the data and treating it as digital data, or by storing the data, e.g. with DMU Library Special Collections (the University's archive service) and recording the metadata on the University data repository at   including details of how to access the data.  \\n\\n11.It is recognised that the most appropriate location for making data open may be a specific domain repository.  This may be because a funder requires it (e.g. UK Data Service for ESRC-funded research), or because it is the most appropriate for a particular discipline (e.g. Archaeology Data Service).  Data should be deposited in the most appropriate repository, and metadata recorded and made openly available via the University data repository at    \\n\\n12. To enable research data to be discoverable and effectively re-used by others, sufficient metadata should be recorded and made openly available via the University data repository (   \\n\\n13. Research data that may be of future historical interest, including data that substantiate research findings, should normally be offered and assessed for deposit and retention in an appropriate data service, domain repository, the University data repository or (in the case of non-digital material) with DMU Library Special Collections (the University's archive service).  \\n\\n14. The legitimate interests of the subjects of research data, and future historical interests, must be protected, e.g. in accordance with data protection laws, research ethics, human rights and duty of confidence.  \\n\\n15. Where a funding body, publisher or their agent requests exclusive rights to publish or re-use University research data without any assurance that it will be made openly available upon publication, the University’s default position will be to refuse such a request, unless required to grant such rights as part of the terms and conditions of a grant, or under a legal obligation.  \\n\\n16. Where any research is subject to any associated contractual arrangements and/or grant conditions that conflict with this policy, the provisions of such contractual arrangements and/or grant conditions will take precedence.  \\n\\n17.It is recognised that there are sound reasons why the openness of research data may need to be restricted.  For example (but not limited to) the following:  \\n\\na. where individuals’ legitimate interests would be compromised (e.g. under the Data Protection Act);   \\nb. where data is commercially sensitive;   \\nc. where intellectual property rights do not permit;   \\nd. where the investment of time/money/resources would be disproportionate to the anticipated benefits to the University and/or research community.  \\n\\n18. These are decisions that individual researchers should look at on a case by case basis, for each dataset, and (where the project is funded) may have to justify their decision to the research funder.  \\n\\n19.It is recognised that DMU researchers who generate original data must have reasonable right of exclusive first use for an appropriate and well-defined period, which may vary by subject and discipline area. They may, therefore, wish to set an embargo on the publication of their data. This should be considered from the earliest stages of project planning and set out in the Data Management Plan.  \\n\\n20. DMU researchers are required to comply with the conditions of their research funders’ data management policies.  \\n\\n21. Responsibility for the creation of a DMP (where required), the updating of that plan, and the implementation of the plan throughout the research lifecycle during any research project or  programme lies with the PI or most senior DMU researcher associated with the project.  \\n\\n22. All research data (through funded or unfunded projects) must be assigned a ‘Data Steward’.  This will normally be the most senior DMU researcher associated with the Project to which the dataset relates.  The ‘Data Steward’ is responsible for ensuring the requirements of this policy are met and is the named contact for any enquiries about the data.  \\n\\n23. Where the research is part of a collaborative project led by an external partner, it is the responsibility of the most senior DMU researcher associated with the project to ensure that DMU is able to meet the requirements of this policy and to keep a copy of any DMP and other data agreements.  \\n\\n24. When undertaking research projects in collaboration with other institutions, organisations or individuals, DMU researchers should ensure that ownership and copyright of data generated and/or shared is specified in a data sharing agreement which sets out clearly the obligations and permissions of each party with regard to the data.  \\n\\n25.It is the responsibility of researchers to discuss with the relevant departments (e.g. ITMS, Library and Learning Services) whether there will be any cost to their project for the storage (including server patches), backup, deposit and retention of the project research data; and to ensure, before starting their research project, that any costs during the life of the project and after can be covered.  \\n\\n26.It is the responsibility of the researcher to handle personal data lawfully and according to DMU’s internal data management procedures and according to the General Data Protection Regulation and Data Protection Act 2018.  \\n\\n27.It should be the default position that personal data cannot be treated as open data unless fully anonymised. However, it is accepted that in rare circumstances exceptions may need to be made, for example, with regard to oral history. Personal data should not be treated as open data in an un-anonymised form unless agreed by Research Services and, if necessary, by the Information Governance team.  \\n\\n28. DMU researchers should, where possible, include costs for storing and making data open in external funding applications.  \\n\\n29. Faculty Associate Deans for Research, Institute Directors and others responsible for research-active staff and students should ensure that DMU researchers in their areas are aware of the University’s policy regarding research data management and its associated guidelines and procedures.  \\n\\n30. DMU researchers should ensure published results always include information on how to access the supporting data.  Where data supporting publications is made open, it should be accessible by the publication date and in citeable format.  \\n\\n31. All ‘external DMU researchers’ agree to indemnify DMU in full for any legal costs incurred by DMU in relation to any legal action taken by DMU against any breach of this policy and or any policy mentioned within this policy.  \\n\\n## DMU’S RESPONSIBILITIES  \\n\\n32. The University will provide access to training, support, advice and where appropriate, guidelines and templates for research data management and data management plans.  \\n\\n33. The University will provide the infrastructure for the storage, backup, deposit and retention of research data in support of current and future access, during and after completion of research projects.  This may be charged to the research project (see paragraph 17).  \\n\\n## ENFORCEMENT  \\n\\n34. In the event of any breach of this policy and any policy mentioned within this policy, by any ‘DMU researchers’ (as defined above) or ‘external DMU researchers’, DMU reserves the right to take appropriate legal action.  \\n\\n## DEFINITIONS  \\n\\n“The University” and “DMU” mean De Montfort University “Dataset” means a set of files containing Research Data, Metadata (including Published Metadata) and Documentation  \\n\\n“Data Steward” will be the most senior DMU researcher associated with the project to which the deposited dataset relates, or their authorised agent (e.g. a PGR student) who is responsible for ensuring the requirements of the Research Data Management policy are met and is the named contact for any enquiries about the data.  \\n\\n“DMU Researchers” refers to DMU staff who undertake academic research, postgraduate research students, external consultants, visitors and contractors conducting research at or on behalf of the University.  \\n\\n“Documentation” means any digital files such as a codebook, technical report or methodology which explain the Research Data’s production, structure or use.  \\n\\n“External DMU Researchers” means external consultants, visitors and contractors conducting research at or on behalf of the University.  \\n\\n“Metadata” means descriptive or contextual information that is associated with the data to assist in the identification, location and retrieval of it by users.  \\n\\n“Personal Data” means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ('data subject'); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person; “Processing” means any operation or set of operations which is performed on Personal Data or on sets of Personal Data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction;  \\n\\n“Research Data” are defined as the evidence that underpins the answer to the research question and can be used to validate findings, regardless of its form (eg. print, digital or physical).  These might be quantitative information or qualitative statements collected by researchers in the course of their work by experimentation, observation, modelling, interview or other methods, or information derived from existing evidence. They may include (but are not limited to) statistics, collections of digital images, sound recordings, transcripts of interviews, survey data and fieldwork, an artwork, archives, found objects, published texts or a manuscript.\",\n",
       " '# Edinburgh Napier University Research Data Management Policy  \\n\\n## Introduction/Rationale  \\n\\nEdinburgh Napier University (the University) is committed to delivering excellent research and, as research data is at the very core of evidencing research quality and integrity, it is vital that robust research data management,  open data policies and procedures are in place to ensure that research conducted by, and under the auspices of, Edinburgh Napier University meets the highest standards to comply with legislative, regulatory, audit, funding body, partner (stakeholder) and internal requirements.  \\n\\nThis policy underlines the University’s commitment to the Universities UK Concordats on open research data and research integrity, by highlighting the importance of the management of research data to good governance and best practice.  \\n\\nFurther to this, in line with the UK and Scottish Government’ research funders (such as UK Research and Innovation, Horizon Europe and UK research charities) commitment to open data and to ensuring that the outputs from research are freely accessible, the University requires research data to be managed efficiently and effectively to facilitate such use, sharing and publication as appropriate to ensure the maximum benefit is derived from any research undertaken under its auspices.  \\n\\n# Scope of Policy  \\n\\nThis policy applies to all researchers and support staff employed to conduct research and innovation activities under the auspices of the University and to all research data regardless of how it is funded. It includes research undertaken by research postgraduate students.  \\n\\nThis policy covers all data, information and records created, received, and maintained during research activities, in any format whether physical and electronic. These might be quantitative information or qualitative statements collected by researchers in the course of their work by experimentation, observation, modelling, interview or other methods, or information derived from existing evidence. Data may be raw or primary (e.g. direct from measurement or collection) or derived from primary data for subsequent analysis or interpretation (e.g. cleaned up or as an extract from a larger data set) or derived from existing sources where the rights may be held by others.  \\n\\nThey may include statistics, instrument measurements, collections of digital images, sound or video recordings, transcripts of interviews, survey data and fieldwork observations with appropriate annotations, an interpretation, an artwork, archives, found objects, published texts or manuscripts, simulation data, models & software, slides, physical artefacts, specimens, samples, questionnaires, sketches, diaries, lab notebooks, social media data, etc.  \\n\\n## Policy Aims and Objectives  \\n\\n• To ensure that all colleagues dealing with research data recognise their responsibilities and the obligations placed on them and the University by stakeholders;  \\n\\n• To promote open access to research data to support collaboration;  \\n\\n• To ensure that the University fully complies with the requirements of specific funding bodies.  \\n\\n## Policy Statement  \\n\\nAll research data created during research and innovation activities, whether internally, unfunded, or externally funded, must be created, received, and maintained in accordance with associated policies and procedures and as defined in ENU’s Responsibilities guidelines.  \\n\\nA Research Data Management plan (DMP) or a declaration stating no data will be generated must be submitted as part of the project proposal for ALL research projects. The DMP must adhere to the requirements of the University using templates and guidance provided by the University, whether or not required by external funding bodies. Where specifically required by funding bodies, the Research Data Management Plan must meet the requirements of both the University and funding bodies.  \\n\\nIntellectual property, copyright and/or rights to re-use/share the data remain with the University (as per the Intellectual Property policy) unless otherwise dictated by the funding body and agreed by the University.  \\n\\nIf researchers/employees leave the University, data and records relating to any research conducted under the auspices of the University remain the property of the University. Remaining data files should be assigned a data custodian responsible for the management or the data.  \\n\\nWhere the Principal Investigator and the grant transfer to another institution during a project, the University will normally accord the rights for the data and records generated up to that time to transfer as an integral part of the research but will retain a copy as part of its own research record.  \\n\\nNew employees bringing with them existing research contracts are required to comply with the University’s policy on research data and records from the commencement of their employment.  \\n\\nEdinburgh Napier University Research Data Management Policy April 2015, Revision March 2022  \\n\\n## Responsibilities  \\n\\nThe most senior Edinburgh Napier University researcher associated with a research project is the Principal Investigator, unless specified otherwise on the funding application, for that project and is ultimately responsible for research data management and planning including making research data open.  \\n\\nIn the case of a PhD project, the Director of Studies is responsible. It is their duty to ensure that all members of the research team with access to the research data adhere to good research data management practice.  \\n\\nIn the case of collaborative projects, if the Principal Investigator is based elsewhere, the lead researcher at Edinburgh Napier University must take responsibility for all data generated here.  \\n\\nThroughout the lifecycle of the research data, researchers and support staff involved in the management of the data must ensure that the following principles are adhered to in order to achieve the objective of the capture and maintenance of authentic, reliable, open and re-useable data:  \\n\\n1. Researchers must comply with funder data management requirements and are responsible for making themselves familiar with and adhering to legislation (including data protection and trusted research), contractual obligations and funder policies governing their research data.   \\n2. Ensure they undertake training and cognisance of the guidance and support as offered by the University.   \\n3. Seek to recover the direct costs of managing research data from the research funder where possible.   \\n4. Researchers must ensure that active research data are stored securely and protected from loss. University approved systems such as the University networked storage system must be used for storing research data in both original and processed formats. The University has created a central research data file store for this purpose and will provide advice on technical solutions for research data storage and archiving.   \\n5. Ensure that Metadata describing the structure and content of the data is routinely created and updated, whether manually or automatically, for project continuity purposes in line with University metadata standards and conventions guidance. At the end of the project, researchers will ensure that appropriately structured metadata describing the research data they hold is published (normally within 12 months of the data being generated) and made freely accessible on the internet.   \\n6. Ensure data is stored for a period at least as long as that required by any funder or sponsor of the research. Research data must be retained after project completion if they substantiate research findings, are of potential long-term value or support a patent for at least 10 years.   \\n7. Ensure research data that have been selected for retention are made openly available with as few restrictions as possible, unless this would breach legislative, regulatory, contractual, ethical or other obligations, or where the cost of doing so  \\n\\nwould be prohibitive. Wherever possible, potential restrictions on data should be described in the project’s data management plan.  \\n\\n8. Register all research data to be openly discoverable with the repository within the University Research Management System, Worktribe, whether they are hosted by the University or maintained elsewhere, even if access to the data is restricted. It is important that the metadata is open even if the datasets themselves cannot be made freely available to comply with FAIR data requirements (Findable, accessible, interoperable and reproducible).  \\n\\n9. Where you are not sure if data can be made available or if the data is restricted and there are concerns about a data access request you should contact RDM@napier.ac.uk  for advice and if necessary to convene the University research data access committee to consider whether it is appropriate to share closed data with another organisation.  \\n\\n10. Datasets deposited in the repository should be accompanied with a readme file. A readme file provides information about a data file and is intended to help ensure that the data can be correctly interpreted, by yourself at a later date or by others when sharing or publishing data.  \\n\\n11. Those who have contributed to the collection and analysis should be acknowledged in the dataset/output record eg contribution tab in output record in Worktribe or through CRediT when available in external systems.  \\n\\n12. Datasets should be assigned a digital object identifier or DOI (the library can provide on request) and other persistent identifiers such as ORCIDs and grant IDs wherever possible and apply appropriate creative commons licenses to clarify ownership and use of data.  \\n\\n13. Ensure published research outputs reporting publicly funded research include a data access statement. This is a short statement describing how and on what terms any supporting research data or underlying research materials may be accessed. Underlying research materials are research data as defined in the Concordat on Open Research Data and can include code, software, numerical scores, textual records, images, sounds, objects and manuscripts. A data access statement should be provided on outputs, even where there are no data associated with the article or the data are inaccessible.  \\n\\n14. Ensure exclusive rights to re-use or publish research data are not handed over to commercial publishers or agents without retaining the rights to make the data openly available for re-use unless this is a condition of funding.  \\n\\n### Principal Investigators (PIs)  \\n\\nPIs have primary responsibility for:  \\n\\n• Ensuring that a robust DMP plan is in place, prior to the start of the project (ideally at project planning/application stage) which is implemented and maintained throughout the course of the research project.  \\n\\n• Maintaining appropriate metadata and documentation throughout the lifecycle of the data as prescribed by the University.  \\n\\n• Ensuring staff designated with research data management duties have clearly defined and documented responsibilities which adhere to university guidance. • Ensuring that they and staff with designated data management responsibilities adhere to the requirements for capturing and maintaining research data. • Ultimate responsibility to ensure effective data curation throughout the lifecycle of the research data.  \\n\\n### Deans of Schools  \\n\\n• Have overall responsibility for the management of research data generated by their School’s research activities; • Responsibility for appointing a replacement should the Principal Investigator leave the University before their duties relating to data management have been discharged;  \\n\\n## The University  \\n\\nEdinburgh Napier University recognises its obligations to:  \\n\\n• Ensure that appropriate training, support and guidance is available to enable   \\nresearchers to comply with this policy;   \\n• Establish a register of research records as per the University guidance;   \\n• Ensure that the necessary central support is available to researchers to facilitate consistent, compliant and best practice research data management; Central support will be provided across Research Innovation and Enterprise, Library Services and IT and Governance Services;   \\n• Provide an institutional repository and appropriate services for the management of research data which will facilitate and enable the capture, storage, maintenance, use, re-use/ sharing/ publication and continuity of the data.   \\n• Maximise the impact and public benefit of research by enabling publication of research data and its metadata via appropriate data repositories and data centres.   \\n• Ensure that this Policy is communicated through publication, promotion, induction and review processes.  \\n\\n## Implementation, Compliance and Monitoring  \\n\\nThe University will monitor compliance with the DMP policy on an ongoing basis by random sampling. The University may take internal disciplinary action in the event of a breach of this Policy or of the associated legislation and regulation.  \\n\\n## Links  \\n\\n• Research Data Management   \\n• Data Protection Policy and Code of Practice   \\n• Information Security Policy   \\n• Records Management Policy   \\nAccess to Information Policy   \\nIntellectual Property policy  \\n\\n# Contact  \\n\\nJob Title: Head of Research Governance Team: Research, Innovation and Enterprise Contact details: rdm@napier.ac.uk  \\n\\nV2.0  \\n\\nVersion control:   \\n\\n\\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>section</td><td>change</td></tr><tr><td>V2.0</td><td>Introduction</td><td>Added references to concordat on open data, updated RCUK to UK Research and Innovation, added other funders - Horizon Europe and UK research charities</td></tr><tr><td>V2.0</td><td>Scope</td><td>Added more details on types of research data as defined in sector documents</td></tr><tr><td>V2.0</td><td>Policy statement</td><td>Minor changes to wording, addition of link to IP policy</td></tr><tr><td>V2.0</td><td>Responsibilities summary</td><td>Some working and formatting changes</td></tr><tr><td>V2.0</td><td>Responsibilities point 1</td><td>Added examples and links related to legal responsibilities</td></tr><tr><td>V2.0</td><td>Responsibilities point 2, 4</td><td>Added links to university guidance</td></tr><tr><td>V2.0</td><td>Responsibilities points 5-14</td><td>Reordered and added links.

       " '# Guidelines for Research Data Management at ETH Zurich (RDM Guidelines)1  \\n\\n1 July 2022  \\n\\nThe Executive Board   \\npursuant to Article 4, Paragraph 1g and Art. 10, Paragraph 4b of the ETH Zurich   \\nOrganization Ordinance of 16 December 2003 (RSETHZ 201.021)2 as well as pursuant to   \\nArticle 3, Paragraph 3 and Article 10, Paragraph 4 of the ETH Zurich Guidelines on Scientific   \\nIntegrity (Integrity Guidelines) of 1 January 2022 (RSETHZ 414)3 issues the following   \\nguidelines:  \\n\\n## Preamble  \\n\\nETH Zurich considers Research Data of high quality as an essential resource and Research Data Management as part of good scientific practice according to internationally recognised standards for scientific integrity. ETH is convinced that good data management enhances the robustness of research findings, facilitates research collaborations, makes research results more reproducible, and strengthens society’s trust in science.  \\n\\nETH Zurich therefore commits to creating a research environment that supports FAIR4 Research Data Management by design. ETH Zurich engages on a national and international level to provide a sustainable and suitable infrastructure for Research Data Management to offer its researchers information and services that satisfy the highest standards. The ideal to be strived for is Open Research Data (ORD) — the practice of making Research Data publicly available, accessible and reusable while always respecting legal and ethical framework conditions (“as open as possible, as closed as necessary”).  \\n\\nThe Guidelines for Research Data Management (hereinafter “RDM Guidelines”) specify further details of Research Data Management in accordance with Art. 10 Para. 4 of the ETH Zurich Guidelines on scientific integrity (Integrity Guidelines)5. They take into account strategic developments and activities on the national level and within the ETH Domain6. They serve to establish minimal requirements for all ETH Zurich members involved in scientific research and to define responsibilities. They can be complemented by departmental regulations which foster recognised Community Standards pertaining to Research Data Management and Open Research Data by design.  \\n\\n### Chapter 1: General terms  \\n\\n#### Art. 1   Purpose  \\n\\n1 Based on article 10, paragraph 4 of the ETH Zurich Guidelines on Scientific Integrity (hereinafter Integrity Guidelines)7, the purpose of these guidelines is to define principles for Research Data Management (RDM) and Open Research Data (ORD) at ETH Zurich.  \\n\\n2 The guidelines are complementary to the Open Access-Policy,8 the Statutes of the ETH Zurich Ethics Commission,9 the Policy for Information and Communications Technology,10 and the Exploitation Guidelines.11  \\n\\n3 Applicable national and international law always takes precedence (e.g. personal data protection, export control of dual-use technology, archiving, copyright).12  \\n\\n#### Art. 2   Scope  \\n\\n1 These guidelines apply to all members (including academic guests)13 of ETH Zurich involved in scientific research (hereinafter \"researchers\").  \\n\\n2 The present guidelines complement and do not supersede regulations issued by Swiss, European and international funding agencies, which prevail in case of any discrepancies.  \\n\\n3 In research projects financed by commercial and/or private third parties, the guidelines should be taken into account when negotiating conditions with partners and should be followed as far as possible within the contractual obligations.  \\n\\n4 Within the context of academic research cooperation that extends beyond ETH Zurich, researchers of ETH Zurich involved are responsible for compliance with these guidelines.  \\n\\n#### Art. 3   Definitions  \\n\\n1 Research Data are all data that the relevant scientific community accepts as necessary for validating research findings (based on Article 10 of the Integrity Guidelines).14  \\n\\n2 Metadata are data that provide information about data.  \\n\\n3 Programming Code signifies machine-readable instructions created in the context of a research project, for example, to analyse Research Data, to reproduce research findings from a given data set or to perform experiments.  \\n\\n4 FAIR Principles are internationally recognised guidelines to improve the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse of digital assets. The principles emphasise machine-actionability (for details see Annex A).15  \\n\\n5 Open Research Data (ORD) are Research Data that are FAIR and, in addition, publicly available, accessible and reusable at no cost. These guidelines understand ORD as an ideal to be strived for that might not be achievable in all cases (for justified exceptions see Art. 6.3).  \\n\\n6 Research Data Management (hereinafter “RDM”) is the systematic, transparent, and adequate handling of data across the complete data lifecycle using recognised services and infrastructures. Research Data Management planning includes measures to be undertaken at every step of the data lifecycle16 to ensure transparency and reproducibility of research. Data management planning starts from the creation and/or collection of data, followed by their analysis, publication, storage, sharing, preservation and reuse. Together, all these steps are continuously documented in a Data Management Plan (hereinafter “DMP”). In addition, RDM can support fulfilling the FAIR Principles by distinguishing data of temporary or permanent relevance according to accepted Community Standards and thus providing a reliable basis for informed decisions on data deletion, temporary retention (usually a minimum of 10 years), or unlimited preservation.  \\n\\n7 Community Standards are understood as both explicit, formalised standards and informal, but well established and widely accepted best practices within a community. A community can, e.g. comprise researchers sharing an interest in the same object of research or working with the same methods. Common Community Standards address, e.g. identification, citation and reporting of Research Data and Metadata. They reflect a community’s consensus, at a certain point in time, on how reproducible and reusable research should be implemented.  \\n\\n8 Data Availability Statements provide a statement about where data necessary for validating the research findings reported in a result publication can be found — including, where applicable, hyperlinks to publicly archived additional datasets analysed or generated during the research activity.  \\n\\n9 Research Group Leaders are professors or heads of platforms and scientific facilities who hold budget and the overall responsibility for a research group, platform, or facility.  \\n\\n### Chapter 2: Research Data Management  \\n\\nArt. 4   Planning of Research Data Management  \\n\\n1 ETH Zurich expects its researchers to include RDM in the planning of their activities.  \\n\\n2 The establishment of best practices for working with Research Data in line with Community Standards is required and should be agreed upon on the appropriate organisational level (see article 10 below)  \\n\\n3 For research projects with temporal boundaries, a DMP (according to Art. 3, Para. 6 above) is expected not later than 6 months after the start of the research project. The DMP is an instrument for researchers themselves, to facilitate the implementation of good RDM practice in their projects as well as for planning storage and safeguarding of data according to Art. 7 below.  \\n\\n4 DMP stipulations issued by funding agencies must be strictly adhered to. The responsibility for this lies with the grantee(s).  \\n\\n#### Art. 5   Data collection and processing  \\n\\n1 Digital data that are in the process of being collected or processed must be stored such that data can be restored in case of hardware problems or human error. Using storage systems centrally supplied by ETH fulfils this criterion. If such data are too big for being stored redundantly in the available infrastructure, researchers must be able to recreate them using existing code and documentation when required.  \\n\\n2 Access rights to the storage system must be specified and regularly updated, e.g. upon the start of a new project. The scientific needs of all researchers working with the data must be considered by the access right system. Unauthorised access must be prevented by suitable technical and organisational measures, such as ETH Zurich’s identity and access management system.  \\n\\n3 In order to ensure long-term accessibility and reusability, the use of well-documented, nonproprietary file formats is recommended.  \\n\\n4 The structure and the processing steps of all Research Data must be digitally documented in order to ensure adherence to the FAIR principles. Where documentation includes a lab journal, Electronic Laboratory Notebooks (ELN) are recommended.  \\n\\n#### Art. 6   Publication of Research Data and Programming Code  \\n\\n1 Publication  \\n\\na. Research Data and Programming Code that are considered as directly relevant for a result publication based on Community Standards must be published and deposited in a FAIR repository along with rich, openly available Metadata.  \\n\\n(i) If there are limitations for sharing relevant raw data online because sharing is technically or economically not feasible, FAIR allows for publishing Metadata only which contain information on how raw data can be accessed if necessary.  \\n\\n(ii) In the case of long-range data collection projects, the Research Data and Programming Code that are relevant for a result publication may be defined as a subset and may be aggregated.  \\n\\nb. Research Data and Programming Code17 are by default published at the same time as the associated results. c. All publications of research results must contain a Data Availability Statement.  \\n\\n#### 2 Repositories  \\n\\na. The ETH Research Collection is available as institutional repository for Research Data publication. If a recognised ETH-external FAIR repository18 is used for depositing Research Data or Programming Code, it is recommended to register a metadata-only item in the ETH Research Collection linking to the dataset.   \\nb. Commercial platforms which are well-suited for specific purposes (e.g. code development) are usually not considered as FAIR repositories. In case such platforms are used, a copy of the version of Programming Code belonging to a result publication must be archived in a FAIR repository.19   \\nc. Commercial repositories should be avoided whenever possible.  \\n\\n3 Restrictions  \\n\\nRestrictions on sharing and publishing Research Data and Programming Code may be justified and, in some cases, necessitated by the following reasons:  \\n\\na. constraints due to institutional provisions and/or applicable superordinate national and/or international ethical principles and/or legal regulations;   \\nb. ongoing preparation of a patent application;   \\nc. contractual obligations (e.g. to industry partners);   \\nd. intended commercial use of a software linked to a data set;   \\ne. intended use of Research Data and Programming Code for commercial purposes, e.g. sale.  \\n\\n4 Licences  \\n\\na. Researchers must not hand over exclusive rights to the publication and further use of Research Data and/or Programming Code to repositories.   \\nb. ETH Zurich advocates the precise specification of usage rights for Research Data in the form of a Creative Commons Licence or a Public Domain Dedication (CC0). For Programming Code, established Open Source licenses20 must be used.  \\n\\n5 ETH Zurich supports the publication of Research Data and Programming Code as independent and citable academic achievements.  \\n\\n#### Art. 7   Storage and Safeguarding  \\n\\n1 Research Data deposited in a repository according to the FAIR principles (see Art. 6) must be retained for extended periods of time, as a rule for a minimum of 10 years, unless legal or funder regulations or Community Standards require other periods. Researchers must make sure that the chosen repository observes the minimum and, where applicable, maximum storage periods.  \\n\\n2 For data which are not explicitly mentioned in Art. 5 and 6 and which are not deposited in a repository, a minimum storage period of 10 years applies where technically and economically feasible. Such data must be safeguarded at ETH Zurich if they are required for justifying the origin of published data in cases where those data might be challenged (see Art. 11 of the Integrity Guidelines).21  \\n\\n3 For practical and cost reasons, such data can be moved, e.g. to inexpensive storage with ETH Zurich’s IT Services together with information on responsible contact persons and required retention periods. If for such data redundant storage in the available infrastructure is technically or economically not feasible, researchers must be able to fully recreate them using existing code and documentation if required.  \\n\\n### Chapter 3: Responsibilities  \\n\\n#### Art. 8   Responsibilities of researchers  \\n\\n1 The departments:  \\n\\na. inform new researchers about the RDM Guidelines that are in force at ETH and, if applicable, at the level of the department; and   \\nb. define processes for the case where a Research Group Leader leaves ETH or retires in order to prevent the loss of valuable data and to make sure that archiving periods are observed.  \\n\\n2 Research Group Leaders are responsible for good RDM practice in their research groups, platform, or facility. This implies in particular:  \\n\\na. ensuring compliance with Community Standards, the present ETH’s RDM Guidelines and, if applicable, departmental as well as RDM guidelines established by other organizational units to which the group, platform or facility relates (e.g. institute, laboratory, non-departmental research unit);   \\nb. ensuring access to suitable infrastructures (whether provided ETH-internal or – external); and   \\nc. taking decisions about access rights for unpublished data as well as for group members leaving ETH Zurich.22  \\n\\n3 Research Group Leaders are free to define further roles and responsibilities regarding RDM.  \\n\\n#### Art. 9   Responsible administrative units  \\n\\n1 ETH Zurich provides the basic infrastructure, information and services that facilitate and where possible enable RDM according to the present guidelines.  \\n\\n2 ETH’s central IT Services as well as IT support groups in the departments and all organisational units (e.g. institute, laboratory, non-departmental research unit) support researchers with processing and management of Research Data and Programming Code (see Annex B for details).  \\n\\n3 The ETH Library supports researchers in the planning of RDM as well as in the publication and long-term archiving of data (see Annex B for details).  \\n\\n4 ETH Zurich may require financial expenditure to be covered by research groups for usage of infrastructure and services and for individual technical solutions provided.  \\n\\n5 The Office of Research is the main contact point for questions of policy development and supports the departments, organisational units (e.g. institutes, laboratories, non-departmental research units) and research groups, platforms, facilities wishing to compile and edit their own guidelines.  \\n\\n6 The ETH Ethics Commission is the main point of contact for ethical questions about the publication of Research Data. The Legal Office may be involved for specific legal questions.  \\n\\n### Chapter 4: Final provisions  \\n\\n#### Art. 10   Further regulations  \\n\\nDepartments, other organisational units (e.g. institute, laboratory, non-departmental research unit) or research groups, platforms and facilities as well as thematic clusters and competence centres consisting of different Departments and/or organisational units can issue further regulations that complement the present guidelines. These regulations may be more specific than but not in contradiction to the RDM Guidelines. Further regulations respect relevant Community Standards. They reflect the perspectives and needs of all academic career levels.  \\n\\n#### Art. 11   Commencement  \\n\\nThe present guidelines enter into force on 1 July 2022.  \\n\\nZurich, 7 June 2022  \\n\\nETH ZURICH  \\n\\nOn behalf of the Executive Board  \\n\\nThe President: Joël Mesot The Secretary General: Katharina Poiger Ruloff  \\n\\n### Annex A: FAIR Principles23  \\n\\na.

       " '# Research Data Management Policy of the University of Münster  \\n\\n## Preamble  \\n\\nResearch data represents a central element of both academic activity and the ensuing acquisition of knowledge, and thereby serves as an essential tool for acquiring knowledge. In the following, ‘research data’ is defined as all data collected, mined, simulated or derived in connection with a research process. The University of Münster (WWU) regards research data, therefore, as an academic product, to which it attaches great importance. In order to acquire, disseminate and substantiate scientific findings, it is therefore absolutely vital that University staff manage research data in a responsible and academically appropriate manner.1 Handling such data requires early implementation of a research data management policy. This comprises all phases of planning and execution, i.e. generation and collection, as well as the processing, application and storage of research data. It also includes the documentation of the context and tools used for collecting this data, as well as provisions detailing its subsequent use, reproducibility and quality assurance.  \\n\\n## Principles  \\n\\nBased on “The German Research Foundation’s (DFG) Recommendations on Safeguarding Good Scientific Practice”2, the “Rules of Good Scientific Practice of the University of Münster”3 and the “DFG Guidelines on the Handling of Research Data”4, the University of Münster provides the following principles to serve as a guideline for its researchers. The University faculties are to tailor these principles to correspond to their subject-specific requirements.  \\n\\n1. Researchers at the University of Münster are called upon to manage and document their research data responsibly and in accordance with academically recognised standards and practices throughout. Matters of ethics, data protection, copyright, confidentiality and secrecy are to be considered at all times.  \\n\\n2. At the start of a research project, the project director is responsible for clearly stating how the research data is to be handled and ensuring compliance with subject-specific standards.   \\n3. Data management plans are regarded as an essential component of any research project, and therefore have to be drawn up at the start of a project. This plan should be amended with respect to changing circumstances as the project is carried out.   \\n4. Before a research project commences, the project director is called upon to explicitly determine and document all rights connected with research data resulting from the project, e.g. intellectual property rights, copyrights and usage rights. Particular attention should be paid to ensuring that the data remain freely accessible for academic purposes.   \\n5. Research data which serves as the basis of published findings must be archived for long-term usage in a data repository of the University of Münster or a suitable, trustworthy external data repository. If this is impracticable for reasons of confidentiality or secrecy, then equivalent archival solutions have to be implemented. The researchers are personally responsible for determining when and under what legal and usage-related conditions their research data is to be made publicly available.   \\n6. Research data which form the essential basis of acquired knowledge should be documented in a research data registry of the University of Münster.  \\n\\nThe University of Münster pledges to create the conditions necessary for complying with the principles listed above.5  \\n\\nSupplementary instructions for concretely applying and implementing these principles in research practice will be made available and updated on a continuous basis.  \\n\\nAdopted (in the original German version) by the Rectorate on 11 May 2017.  \\n\\nThe Rector, Prof Dr Johannes P. Wessels  \\n\\nAdopted (in the original German version) by the Senate on 14 June 2017  \\n\\nChairman of the Senate, Prof Dr Georg Peters',\n",
       " \"# Faculty of Applied Sciences Research Data Management Policy  \\n\\n  \\n\\n## Preface  \\n\\nThe Faculty of Applied Sciences Research Data Management Policy is part of the central TU Delft Research Data Framework Policy (which outlines the roles of the Library, ICT Department, University Services and the Executive Board at TU Delft, and from which italic sentences in this policy are derived).1 This policy helps create effective practices for working with research data at the faculty, and defines data management roles and responsibilities of the different stakeholders within the Faculty from the 1st of January 2020 onwards.  \\n\\nThe principles outlined in this policy are elaborated in more detail, with supporting information available in the online guidance.2  \\n\\nThis policy is motivated by the belief that good data management leads to research that is more time- and cost-efficient as it prevents data loss and duplication of efforts and can contribute to the quality, reproducibility and impact of research. This policy is inspired by the FAIR principles: research data should be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) by archiving the data with proper documentation.  \\n\\n### This policy cultivates:  \\n\\n: Best practice for ensuring that scientific arguments and results are reproducible in the long term.   \\n: Better exposure of academic work of researchers at TU Delft leading to   \\nrecognition of the quality of the research process as a whole.   \\n: Responsible management of research data, including the secure storage of   \\npersonal data (in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)/Algemene verordening gegevensbescherming (AVG))3 and the protection of intellectual property rights.   \\n: Improved practices for meeting the demands of funders and publishers with   \\nrespect to research data management and sharing.   \\n: Long term preservation of the data underlying publications for future users   \\nwithin and outside the research group. This cannot be guaranteed by publishing the data in supplementary materials or by only making the data available upon   \\nrequest.  \\n\\n### This policy recognises that:  \\n\\n: Individual departments and research groups have different working practices and processes and will therefore require dedicated guidelines. : Research Data Management covers the entire process of managing research data from its creation to its re-use and preservation, which is not equal to Open Science. While it is beneficial to publish research data openly, there might be valid ethical, legal or commercial implications, which will make data unsuitable for open sharing. . Research data refers to all data created in the course of research and includes source code, algorithms, simulations and models, experimental notes (paper or digital), physical samples, questionnaires, video and audio recordings, protocols, and other forms of information supporting traditional publication.  \\n\\n### The key points of this policy are:  \\n\\nAll individuals involved in research follow the research data management strategy   \\nof their research group.   \\n: All individuals involved in research attend data management training when   \\nneeded.   \\n: Research data and code needed to reproduce research findings are appropriately   \\ndocumented, stored and shared in a suitable repository. : The minimal requirement is the deposition of the numerical data (processed data) underlying the figures and conclusions in academic papers and PhD theses.   \\n: Data Stewards can assist researchers in these activities.  \\n\\n## Faculty Roles and Responsibilities  \\n\\nRegulation (GDPR)/Algemene verordening gegevensbescherming (AVG).5 Contractual agreements with third parties on confidentiality of data should be respected at all times.   \\n: Understanding who owns research data resulting from their projects and what that implies in terms of data management, particularly sharing and publishing.   \\n: Properly citing research data, in accordance with the FORCE11 Joint Declaration of Data Citation Principles.6   \\n: Undertaking training in good data management, as required.  \\n\\n### PhD students are responsible for:  \\n\\n: Developing a written data management plan (DMP) for managing research outputs within the first 12 months of the PhD study. (As part of the Go/No-Go meeting. For all PhDs starting from 1 January 2020 onwards.)   \\n: Attending the relevant training in data management, for which credits can be obtained through the Graduate School.   \\n: Ensuring that all data and code underlying completed PhD theses are   \\nappropriately documented and accessible for at least 10 years from the end of the research project, in accordance with the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable), unless there are valid reasons which make   \\nresearch data unsuitable for sharing. (For all PhDs starting from 1 January 2019 onwards.)  \\n\\nAll individuals involved in research are responsible for:  \\n\\n: Ensuring that research data, code and any other materials needed to reproduce research findings are appropriately documented, stored and shared in a research data repository in accordance with the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) for at least 10 years from the end of the research project, unless there are valid reasons not to do so. : The minimal requirement is the deposition of the numerical data (processed data)4 underlying the figures in academic papers and PhD theses. Deposition of datasets not directly linked with publications or raw data/software and processing scripts used to derive the processed data is encouraged. It is recommended to record the version of the software used and where possible store code together with the software used. : Should data not be made available in a repository, ensure that the data management plan and any research publications resulting from the project have a statement explaining what additional datasets/materials exists; why access is restricted; who can use the data and under what circumstances.   \\n: Appropriate management of personal and confidential research data. Personal data should be managed in accordance with the General Data Protection  \\n\\n### Assistant/Associate/Full Professors are responsible for:  \\n\\n: Establishing a research data management strategy for their research group and ensuring that all members of the research group (including students, researchers and support staff involved in research) are aware of the FAIR data principles, are appropriately trained to effectively manage research data, are aware of data storage solutions at TU Delft and that members of the research group adhere to the expectations outlined within this policy.   \\n: Ensuring that all members of the group plan for good data management from the outset of any research project and adhere to good data management practice throughout the project’s lifecycle.   \\n: Ensuring that where projects are funded by external parties or are in collaboration with external parties, agreements made with those parties strive for compliance with this policy and determine maximal embargo periods. Research funded primarily by third parties will have to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to ensure the best interests of all parties involved.   \\n: Budgeting for the costs of research data management into financial project planning at the proposal stage.  \\n\\n### Bachelor/Master thesis Supervisors are responsible for:  \\n\\n. Ensuring that the project's data management is in line with this policy. : Obtaining a written agreement from the student with regards to data processing, re-use and sharing, with administrative support from Education and Student Affairs.  \\n\\n### PhD Supervisors are responsible for:  \\n\\n: Supporting their PhD students in preparation of a written Data Management Plan (DMP) for managing research outputs within the first 12 months of the PhD study. (As part of the Go/No-Go meeting. For all PhDs starting from 1 January   \\n2020 onwards.) : The PhD Supervisor is responsible for reviewing and approving the DMP and the Faculty Data Steward can be contacted for advice and support. : Ensuring that PhD students attend relevant training on data management, for which credits can be obtained through the Graduate School. : Ensuring that their PhD students make all data and code underlying their completed PhD theses appropriately documented and accessible for at least   \\n10 years from the end of the research project, in accordance with the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable), unless there are valid reasons which make research data unsuitable for sharing. (For all PhDs starting from 1 January 2019 onwards.)  \\n\\n### Data Stewards are responsible for:  \\n\\n. Facilitating the development, review and implementation of the faculty's data management policy.   \\n: Creating awareness and explaining to researchers the added value of good data management.   \\n. Assisting researchers in planning the collection, management, and publication of data in research projects and liaising with other service providers (such as Legal services, ICT, Human Research Ethics Committee) as required.   \\n: Helping researchers with writing data management plans and with budgeting for research data management costs in their grant applications.   \\n. Developing and running training events tailored to researchers' needs.   \\n: Identifying researchers who already have good data management practices and encouraging them to become Data Champions7 to establish local contact points of expertise.   \\n: Advising researchers on regulations for working with personal research data (in coordination with the ICT Privacy Team8 and Human Research Ethics Committee9).  \\n\\n### Heads of Departments are responsible for:  \\n\\n: Ensuring that Assistant/Associate/Full Professors have a research data management strategy in place, consistent with the Faculty Research Data Framework Policy.   \\n• \\x07Monitoring and reviewing of data management practices in the department.   \\n: Discussing data management practices with members of the department and encouraging them to adhere to best practices.   \\n: Supporting Data Stewards in identifying Data Champion candidates.  \\n\\n### The Faculty Dean is responsible for:  \\n\\n: Ensuring that Data Stewards are embedded within faculties.   \\n: The development of the Faculty Policy for Research Data Management consisting of department/section specific implementation regulations and goals (e.g. Key Performance Indicators) where necessary.   \\n: Ensuring that research data management is embedded in the Faculty Graduate School regulations.   \\n: Ensuring that reporting on research data management progress is part of the yearly Planning and Control cycle.  \\n\\n## Colofon  \\n\\nWith more than 1,000 employees, including 135 pioneering principal investigators, as well as a population of about 3,400 passionate students, the Faculty of Applied Sciences is an inspiring scientific ecosystem.

       " '# Research Data Management Policy  \\n\\nwithin the Faculty of Arts (FoA)  \\n\\nUpdate October 2022  \\n\\n## 1. Introduction and context  \\n\\nInvesting in the practice of transparent and reproducible science is a high priority of all academic institutions worldwide, organisations like NWO, KNAW and international research funders in general. Research data management, personal data protection and open science are pillars of this movement.  \\n\\nThis research data management (RDM) policy provides context and guidance to all members of the Faculty of Arts (FoA) that deal with research data in its broadest definition. The document will be regularly subjected to a review as it is affected by changes in the various regulations that underpin it.  \\n\\nThe update of this document is based on the UG Research Data Policy dated June 2021, and needs to be read alongside the following documents:  \\n\\nthe European General Data Protection Regulation (2016)   \\nEthics and data protection (2018)   \\nthe ‘Practical Guide to the International Alignment of Research Data Management’ by   \\nScience Europe (2021)   \\nthe Netherlands Code of Conduct for Research Integrity (2018)   \\nthe 2020 University of Groningen Code of Conduct on Integrity   \\nthe University of Groningen PhD regulations (2022)   \\nthe Faculty’s policy and procedures on research ethics (CETO)   \\nthe ethical code of the National Ethics Council for Social and Behavioural Sciences   \\n(NETHICS)  \\n\\n## 2. Organisation and responsibilities  \\n\\nThere is joint responsibility for research data management within the UG. The guiding principle here is the Higher Education and Research Act and the elaboration thereof in the Administration and Management Regulations of the UG, which allocates the responsibility at different levels.  \\n\\nResponsible data management requires collaboration between management (organisational units within the university), scientific staff and support staff.  \\n\\n### Faculty Board  \\n\\nThe faculty board has a duty of care for its researchers and (PhD) students. They are responsible for setting up, maintaining and overseeing the implementation of a responsible data management policy in accordance with the UG Research Data Policy.  \\n\\nThe Board of the FoA has approved this update of the RDM policy document in October 2022. Changes to the RDM policy will also be subject to the approval by the Faculty Board.  \\n\\n### CETO  \\n\\nThe Faculty of Arts (FoA) committee for ethical review of research projects called CETO (Commissie Ethische Toetsing Onderzoek in Dutch) evaluates research projects within the Faculty (and sometimes from UG researchers outside the Faculty) involving human subjects and other ethical aspects. CETO is accountable to the Dean, who acts as Placeholder of Research.  \\n\\nSince July 2020, obtaining ethical approval is obligatory for researchers and PhD students within the FoA who run projects that involve (data of) human subjects.  \\n\\n### Graduate Schools  \\n\\nThe Graduate Schools are responsible for the proper onboarding, training and guidance of PhD students. In this role they can also point out the responsibility of PhD students regarding data management and the attention they should pay to research data management planning (RDMP) in their training and supervision plans (TSP). For training on research data management and data protection principles the Graduate Schools collaborate with the Digital Competence Centre (DCC). The Graduate Schools also play a role in preparing PhD supervisors to make arrangements, together with the PhD student, for the PhD student’s research data to be made reusable.  \\n\\n### Support  \\n\\nThe FoA’s Research Policy Officer coordinates the formulation and implementation of the research data management policy. The Policy Officer works closely together with the Data Steward/CETO secretary, and the FoA’s Privacy & Security Coordinator on matters concerning the GDPR. The data steward/secretary CETO monitors all incoming registrations of research projects and contacts researchers when research is deemed eligible for ethical assessment and/or in case of possible (privacy) risks. Together with the Privacy & Security coordinator, the data steward/secretary CETO performs a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) if deemed necessary. Additionally, the DCC offers university-wide support on research data management and protection and related IT solutions for both researchers and support staff.  \\n\\n### Researchers  \\n\\nThree research institutes accommodate the research of the Faculty of Arts, namely the Centre for Language and Cognition (CLCG), the Groningen Research Institute for the Study of Culture (ICOG) and the Groningen Institute of Archaeology (GIA). Each institute consists of smaller centres or research groups. It follows that the FoA houses a mixed company of researchers, working with many different categories of research data or in fields that are not strictly data-driven.  \\n\\nAnd yet, this RDM policy applies to all researchers and PhD students of the FoA, ensuring that the faculty is exercising its oversight responsibility.  \\n\\n## 3. Principles of Data Management  \\n\\n### Scientific Integrity  \\n\\nThere are several key overarching principles that govern research at the University of Groningen and scientific research in general:  \\n\\n1. All research is to be undertaken according to relevant legislation, the requirements of ethically responsible research, such as informed consent, academic integrity, the arrangements set out in cooperation agreements, and the research conditions of funders.   \\n2. When personal data are processed in research (within or from the EU), these must be handled in a way that meets the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). In particular, this entails the requirement to demonstrate that appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect the identity of research participants are in place.   \\n3. Where feasible and ethically appropriate, researchers will make their data FAIR (see below).   \\n4. Research methodologies, experimental design, data, data analysis, statistics, results and interpretations should be subject to peer review and scrutiny, and all researchers should be able to substantiate their choices, and be able to provide access to all research results (papers, data and code) for validation.  \\n\\n### FAIR research data  \\n\\nThe UG RDM policy is based on the FAIR data principles included in The Netherlands Code of Conduct for Research Integrity. These four principles are:  \\n\\n#### Findable  \\n\\nData is sustainably stored and curated Data is provided with metadata, including affiliation and, if possible, with a persistent identifier Data is registered on the basis of metadata in the research database of the university ccessible  \\n\\nData is accurate, complete, reliable, authentic and provided with metadata and, if possible, with a persistent identifier   \\nData is available for checking and further research after completion of the research and/or the departure of the researcher  \\n\\nData is openly available, unless valid reasons prevent this  \\n\\nInteroperable  \\n\\nData is stored in sustainable file formats The discipline specific standards for the enrichment of data are applied Data (and metadata) is provided with references to other relevant material Reusable  \\n\\n####  \\n\\nThe origin of the data and the affiliation of the researcher involved is clear   \\n(Provenance)   \\nThe discipline specific standards for data management are applied   \\nThe conditions for use are clearly described  \\n\\nThere may be sound reasons not to make data FAIR, however. This policy is based on a “comply or explain” principle, meaning that exceptions to this policy are possible. A researcher may wish not to make the data publicly available when:  \\n\\n1. Making the data publicly available would contradict any agreement or undertaken given as part of the informed consent process   \\n2. Where public release might have negative consequences for the people researched   \\n3. When there is an obligation or objective to protect results so that they can commercially or industrially exploited (or reasonably expected to be exploited)   \\n4. Where public release could represent a security concern   \\n5. If open access would jeopardise achievement of the main aim of the research   \\n6. If there is any other legitimate reason not to publish the data.  \\n\\n### Open Science and Open Access  \\n\\nOpen Science is one of the focal points of the Strategy Evaluation Protocol (SEP). The four pillars of open science are open data, open code (research software), open papers (open access) and open reviews (open evaluation). The FoA stimulates making research data, lab notes and other research processes freely available where possible, under terms that enable reuse, redistribution and reproduction of the research and its underlying data and methods. Doing so will not only result in a more transparent, verifiable and faster research process, but will also enable companies and societal organisations to readily gain access to, and use scientific information in an early phase.  \\n\\n## 4. Research data management workflow agreements  \\n\\nThis Research Data Management Policy formulates a set of agreements that apply to all research conducted within the FoA and that refer to different stages of the research process. The FoA Research Data Management Protocol provides a practical guide listing best practices and preferred solutions.  \\n\\n### Research data before research  \\n\\nRegistration  \\n\\nEach researcher (or group of researchers) has to draw up a Research Data Management Plan (RDMP) for each research project during the phase of research design (for example as part of an application for research funding). This requirement applies to all research projects in which research data are being collected or reused. All PhD students are obliged to draw up and hand in an RDMP at the start of their research project, as part of their Training and Supervision Plan (TSP).  \\n\\nThe FoA offers facilities for digitally submitting an RDMP according to the FoA template (see the FoA RDM protocol).  \\n\\n### GDPR & ethical assessment  \\n\\nResearchers and PhD students have to act in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation when dealing with personal data, and in accordance with other statutory and ethical rules (where they apply). In addition, obtaining ethical approval from CETO is obligatory for researchers and PhD students within the FoA who plan for research projects that involve human subjects or human subject data.  \\n\\n### Research data during research (storage)  \\n\\nIn the life cycle of research data it is important to distinguish between the phase in which data is still being manipulated and analysed (mutable data) and the phase in which research data has been processed and become static (immutable data). The same distinction exists for storage (during research) and archiving systems (after research), which have different functional and technical requirements.  \\n\\n#### On-premises storage  \\n\\nOn-premises storage refers to storage that is hosted by the UG itself in its own data centres, managed by the Centre for Information Technology (CIT), and that is regularly backed-up. Examples are the X- or Y-drive attached to the university workplace (UWP). Storing your research data on-premises is always preferred over using personal (external) storage devices or cloud storage, for reasons of data security and protection (prevention of data loss and data leak).  \\n\\n#### Cloud storage  \\n\\nMany third-party (non-UG-hosted) systems or applications are available to researchers to help collect, share, analyse and/or visualise research data (e.g. Qualtrics, ArcGIS Online, Google Drive). If third party tools process, hold or retain research data in any form in the course of a research project researchers should specify their use of these systems in their RDMP. The FoA strongly recommends researchers to move their research data to onpremises storage as soon as possible after the collection and/or processing of data is complete and after collaborations on shared (cloud) storage have been concluded.  \\n\\n### Research data after research (archiving)  \\n\\nArchiving and retention  \\n\\nData gathered for scientific, historical or statistical purposes should be stored for a period of at least ten years after it has been processed (to enable scrutiny in relation to concerns about matters of scientific integrity).  \\n\\nData can be kept longer than ten years for historical, statistical or research purposes (for example in the case of archeological or historical data).  \\n\\nData must be archived such that:  \\n\\nan academic staff member from the same discipline can understand and verify that data, and possibly replicate the research (data should be accompanied by relevant documentation and metadata); it is accessible in the long term, i.e. stored in a future-proof format.  \\n\\nNon-digital data must be duplicated in digital or non-digital form, so that both the researcher and the Faculty can keep a copy. If it is not possible to make a duplicate, then the data must be stored at the Faculty whereby the researcher will have unrestricted access, including after they leave the employment of the University.  \\n\\n### Personal data storage limitation  \\n\\nIn case of personal data, the GDPR specifies a storage limitation principle: “Personal data shall be kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed.” The GDPR does not set specific time limits for different types of data, but requires that controllers and processors set limits based on the purposes of the processing or that de-identification measures are taken. Researchers should therefore specify when they plan to remove the personal data they have collected, or what (de-identification) measures they have taken to be able to retain their data, in their RDMP.  \\n\\n### Research data publication  \\n\\nResearch data publication ranges from making data findable (registering the availability of a dataset externally) to making data completely and openly available for reuse. Any dataset can be registered in the UG Research Portal (using PURE) so that it is findable externally. Additionally, researchers can upload archived research data to an external repository. A data repository is a place that holds data, makes data available to use, and organises data in a logical manner. A data repository may also be defined as an appropriate, subject-specific location where researchers can submit their data. The FoA strongly encourages researchers to deposit their data and software in an appropriate data repository to enhance their findability, accessibility and impact. Following the FAIR adagium “as open as possible, as closed as necessary” the researcher  \\n\\napplies appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect the data, such as anonymization or pseudonymization (in case of personal data).  \\n\\n### Research software publication  \\n\\nResearch software is defined as any piece of code or script that enables researchers to process, manipulate, generate and analyse data or automatize or test these procedures. The availability of software developed for the purpose of producing research results, together with the respective research data, is essential for the reproducibility and transparency of research. The FoA strongly advises researchers who work with research software to seek the help of the DCC for drafting a Research Software Management Plan in the research design phase, in preparation of software publication after research.  \\n\\n### End of UG affiliation or employment  \\n\\nResearchers who leave the FoA are obliged to deposit and describe the research data they have collected during their work at the University of Groningen. The line manager (chair holder) monitors the correct and complete deposit of the research data. PhD students are obliged to properly deposit and describe their research data at the end of their research project (or when leaving the FoA prematurely). The GSH coordinator (in consultation with the supervisor) checks whether all relevant data has been deposited. The PhD defence ceremony will not be scheduled if this requirement has not been met.',\n",

It also provides archiving solutions for completed projects. The GDC will provide support, training, advice and where appropriate guidelines and templates in all aspects of data management to ensure data integrity and user satisfaction. For more details about the different options and services provided by the GDC contact Aria Minder (aria.minder@env.ethz.ch).  \\n\\n## Requirements  \\n\\nAll data managed on the GDC servers must be directly associated to at least one project listed in the GDC project database. Research data not produced at the GDC can be transferred, stored and analyzed on the GDC server if it is related to an active project. Please note that data transfer over 1TB requires the prior approval from the GDC, and a data integrity test after the transfer is strongly suggested.  \\n\\nOnce the project is completed, the data must be transferred off the server within 12 months. The GDC offers archiving solutions. Information about the project status can be obtained at any time.  \\n\\n# Backup  \\n\\nA backup is defined as a file stored on the backup server that matches a file on the compute server. Backups are intended to reduce the risk from disk crashes and user errors such as accidental deletion of files. All data on the GDC servers is regularly and incrementally backed up for a period of 2 weeks. After this time deleted or damaged data cannot be restored.  \\n\\n# Ownership and Privacy  \\n\\nThe research data managed at the GDC servers belongs to the registered project leader. All users registered with the project can request access to the data and the server. The software licensed to the GDC and the tools written by the GDC cannot be copied or transferred without the consent of the GDC.  \\n\\n# Liability  \\n\\nThe project leader is solely responsible for the project data. The GDC does its best to keep the data safe but cannot be held accountable for data loss. Therefore, the GDC highly recommends the project leaders to keep a copy of initial (raw) data and maybe the processed data if it is costly and time-consuming to reproduce.  \\n\\n# Security  \\n\\nAll users with access to the GDC server have to follow the data protection principles. They must make sure the system is kept safe and secure by  \\n\\nreading the \"Introduction to the GDC computational environment\"   \\nnot sharing login name or password   \\nsharing data only via group folder  \\n\\nThis policy for managing research data was approved by the board of directors on Wednesday 20 May, 2015.',\n",
       " \"# Faculty of Humanities Research Data Management Policy July 2020  \\n\\n## About this document  \\n\\nThis document sets out the policy on the management of research data (hereinafter data) at the Faculty of Humanities of Utrecht University. This policy outlines the criteria and guidelines for adequate data management and specifies the various roles and responsibilities of the parties concerned at the faculty.  \\n\\nThe document is divided into three parts:  \\n\\nI. A description of the aim and scope of the data management policy as well as the policy frameworks within which the policy applies. II. A description of the definitions, principles, responsibilities and guidelines for the policy. III. A description of the current support for data management at the faculty and the university.  \\n\\n## I - Aim, scope and frameworks  \\n\\n### Aim of this policy  \\n\\nThe aim of this policy is to ensure careful data management within the faculty during and after the completion of research projects. The faculty regulates data management according to the FAIR principles:  \\n\\nFindable: data and metadata are findable, preferably in a digital system.   \\nAccessible: data and metadata are stored and maintained in such a manner that they can be accessed and downloaded easily. In addition, there are clear provisions on accessibility and use.   \\nInteroperable: data and metadata are available in common formats and conform to regular standards so that the exchange and the combining of such data with other data or metadata is optimally facilitated.   \\nReusable: data are described in a manner that facilitates research reproduction and/or the combining of the data with other data.1  \\n\\nThe policy focuses on digital data. The faculty aims to store research data in a digital format, as much as is possible. Particular focus is placed on data containing personal data or data to which intellectual property provisions apply.  \\n\\n### Scope of this policy  \\n\\nThe policy applies to everyone who is affiliated with the Faculty of Humanities at Utrecht University and conducts research, including internal and external PhD candidates, but explicitly excluding students.  \\n\\n### Rules, policy frameworks and conditions  \\n\\nThis policy represents the further implementation of a number of laws, regulations and policy frameworks, primarily the Utrecht University Policy Framework for Research Data and the Netherlands Code of Conduct for Research Integrity, in which the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has been taken into account. Furthermore, the policy is in line with the wishes and requirements of research grant providers in the area of data management, in particular the  \\n\\nNetherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) and the European Research Council (ERC), and the principles of Open Science.  \\n\\n## II - Definitions, responsibilities, principles and guidelines  \\n\\n### Definitions  \\n\\n#### Research project  \\n\\nIn this document a research project means: all the activities conducted by researchers aimed at arriving at a scientific analysis or opinions, irrespective of whether they are reflected in or are geared towards publications (or other forms of output).  \\n\\n#### Research data  \\n\\nResearch data are all the data or procedures (such as algorithms) used for a research project that form the basis for the results or lead to results.  \\n\\nResearch data may take many forms including but not limited to: observations, documents, literature references, archaeological material, books, transcribed interviews, source codes, software scripts, parameter settings, theoretical models, simulations and measurements. All the material needed to reproduce research results is regarded as research data and requires adequate data management.  \\n\\nIt is common practice to differentiate between unprocessed (primary/raw/rough) data, the procedures that cleanse, anonymise and prepare the data, and the final secondary ‘cleansed’ data.  \\n\\n#### Personal data  \\n\\nThe GDPR defines personal data as: any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person who is still alive. This means information that either relates directly to a person or can be traced back to that person.2 Personal data can also be provided to third parties, for example, during interviews or in open questions for surveys.  \\n\\nResearch projects in which interviews or surveys are used often involve personal data, i.e. the contact details of the research population. Even though personal data usually are irrelevant for the research, they do form part of the total research data and partially safeguard the integrity of the research.  \\n\\n#### Data package  \\n\\nA coherent set of data and procedures that has been stored unchanged for a longer period of time (archived). A data package contains a description, also referred to as metadata, which clearly shows the content of the package. Based on the data package and the accompanying metadata, it must be possible to validate the claims that are based on the data concerned.  \\n\\nA data package can consist of different data, such as multiple tables, scripts for statistical processing, stimulus material, audio files containing interviews and the interview transcripts in text files.  \\n\\nArchiving (of data packages)  \\n\\nThis refers to the storage of data in an unchanged form for a longer period of time. In many cases data are packaged together with a code book, a lab journal (or archive journal) and a description of the data, the metadata. The set of data and the accompanying description are referred to as a data package. Data packages are archived at the time at which a scientific publication is based on the data package or at the end of a research project.  \\n\\nPublication (of digital data)  \\n\\nIf the data are archived as a data package, the package can subsequently be published. This means that the data package will be findable. In practice, the publication of a data package means that the metadata are published (in a data catalogue, for example).  \\n\\nAlthough publication makes a data package findable, this does not mean that the data are automatically accessible: a data package can be published as a ‘Closed Access Package’ (see also p. 6). A persistent identifier, a reference that enables the clear referencing and easy localisation of digital data, is assigned upon publication of the data package.  \\n\\n### Responsibilities  \\n\\nA general principle is that every staff member is expected to manage relevant data as a good steward. In addition, Utrecht University specifically distinguishes between the following actors, each bearing their own responsibilities for data management.  \\n\\n1. The data creators: researchers and PhD candidates and support staff, who have primary responsibility for looking after the research data. In the case of students, the responsibility lies with their supervisor(s). Supervisor(s) ensure that students are aware of the guidelines on responsible data management. In the case of support staff, the responsibility lies with the researcher ultimately responsible for the particular project.  \\n\\n2. Directors of education and research directors are responsible for ensuring that the researchers, research leaders, students and their supervisors in the department abide by the university policy framework and any supplementary faculty regulations. They may also establish further guidelines as needed.  \\n\\n3. Deans draw up further faculty guidelines pursuant to the university policy framework and are responsible for ensuring that the directors of education and research directors implement both the university policy framework and the faculty guidelines.  \\n\\n4. The Executive Board draws up, ensures monitoring and facilitates the implementation of the general university framework, for example, through the provision of infrastructure, information and other forms of support.  \\n\\n### Principles  \\n\\nData storage and archiving  \\n\\nThe management of research data often relates to forms of storage. A distinction is made between the storage of data used in ongoing research projects and archival storage (see p. 6).  \\n\\nThe storage of data used in ongoing research projects relates to data and scripts that have been created, adjusted and possibly deleted again during the course of the research project. In archival storage the data are stored unchanged for a predetermined period of time.  \\n\\nThe principle underlying the faculty policy is that archival storage must be used as soon as the data concerned are used to substantiate a scientific claim, for instance, for a scientific publication.  \\n\\n### Rights  \\n\\nUtrecht University has the authority to make decisions on data packages stored under the management of Utrecht University on its own infrastructure to the extent that these decisions do not conflict with earlier agreements made with the researcher(s) or between the researcher(s) and other rightholders. Examples are: transferring the data package to another data archive (such as DANS Narcis) or the migration of file formats. Exclusive rights for the reuse or publication of research data will not be transferred to commercial publishers and their representatives without the owners themselves retaining the right to make available the research data for reuse through open access, unless this originally was a precondition for the provision of funds.  \\n\\nAny researcher who is responsible for a research project must draw up a data management plan (DMP) in any event prior to publication, but preferably before the start of the research project. The DMP should at least describe what data will be collected as part of the project, where the data will be stored and who has access to the data during the research project. It also states where (a version of) the data is archived as a data package, how the data package can be found, who can access it and under what conditions.  \\n\\nIf personal data are used in a research project, the DMP should explicitly describe what additional measures have been taken to ensure the lawful and careful handling of personal data. This might include a description of the legal basis for collecting the data (e.g. informed consent), the anonymisation method, and processing upon completion of the project (e.g. the destruction of contact details). Furthermore, a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) must be carried out.3 Finally, the data collection must be registered by the faculty data manager. The responsible researcher initiates these activities and ensures completion in the correct manner.  \\n\\nIn the case of human subject research, a proposal should furthermore be submitted to the Faculty Ethical Review Committee (FETC) prior to conducting the research.4 Data may not be collected until a positive assessment has been received.  \\n\\n### Regulations  \\n\\nStorage of data packages  \\n\\nResearch data must be managed in accordance with the applicable university requirements relating to information security, privacy protection and transparency.   \\nDuring the research project, data must be stored in an environment with an access restrictions option and back-up facilities. The standard environment provided by the faculty for this purpose is YODA. Other options are the O: drive or SURFdrive. Researchers can consult the Research Data Management Support website to identify a suitable storage environment.5 Researchers may propose using a different environment and should first submit a proposal to the faculty data manager.   \\nIf the data contain personal data, the use of YODA as a storage environment is obligatory. It is possible to derogate from this obligation but only with the permission of the Information Security Officer. Local storage is temporarily permitted, for example, because data have been recorded on a peripheral device. However, the data must be encrypted for local storage, and transferred to YODA as soon as possible and destroyed locally. Further guidelines for the storage of data containing personal data follow below.  \\n\\nHandling data containing personal data  \\n\\nLegal requirements laid down in the GDPR apply to the processing of personal data. Researchers attached to the Faculty of Humanities must therefore process personal data in accordance with the requirements laid down in the GDPR, and in accordance with the requirements laid down by Utrecht University and the Faculty of Humanities. In general, this means that6:  \\n\\no Before creating a data collection, the researcher must carry out data classification and a DPIA, supported by the faculty data manager or otherwise.7   \\no Limit: only the personal data required for the research are collected. If, prior to the research, the purpose for which personal data are used to answer a research question is not clear, those personal data should not be collected.   \\no Separate: directly identifiable personal data must be separated from the other data and replaced by pseudo codes as soon as possible. Files in which the directly identifiable personal data and the corresponding pseudo codes are recorded, the ‘key files’, must be separated from the other research data.   \\no Inform: as far as is possible, the persons concerned will be informed of the research and requested to grant permission for use of their data.   \\no Provide control: as far as is possible and/or reasonable, research subjects will be given the opportunity to inspect their data, correct their data or withdraw from the research.   \\no Render unidentifiable: data containing personal data are archived only after anonymisation so that the data cannot be directly traced back to individuals. Anonymisation can be carried out using aggregations, or pseudo codes to replace the personal data.   \\no Hide: data containing personal data must be stored in locations with encryption.   \\no The storage or transmission of such data outside the European Economic Area is not permitted.   \\no Data containing personal data may only be exchanged with third parties provided that explicit agreements (transfer or processing agreements)8 have been concluded for that purpose. As soon as (a version of) the data form the basis for a scientific claim expressed in a scientific publication, for instance, the data concerned are packaged together in a data package, archived and published.   \\nThe data package contains, to the extent possible, all the necessary data, descriptions, scripts and images in order to: o reproduce the research results;   \\no retrieve the origin of the data;   \\no understand the collection method;   \\no identify the staff involved in creating the data package;   \\no understand the objective of the research;   \\no know the conditions for reusing the data;   \\no know the minimum storage duration.  \\n\\nDepending on the archive, repository or storage environment selected, the researcher can include most of the above information in the standard metadata forms currently available. All the information the researcher is unable to include in the metadata forms should be recorded in a text file that is added to the data package.  \\n\\nAs stated earlier, YODA is the faculty's preferred digital archive and publication platform.9 Other data archives, repositories or storage environments may be used. Researchers should consult the Research Data Management Support website to identify a suitable archive environment. Researchers may propose using a different environment and should first submit a proposal to the faculty data manager.   \\nIn principle, data must be anonymised before being archived. Data that cannot be anonymised are archived and published as a data package referenced as ‘Closed Access’. Closed Access data packages can only be accessed by the data owners.   \\nData to which rights apply, such as copyrights, and therefore cannot be archived for a prolonged period or included in the publication of a data package, must be deleted prior to archiving.   \\nData packages are made available as Open Access data to the public, provided that there are no compelling reasons for providing the data under Restricted Access or Closed Access. The Faculty of Humanities’ preferred user licence is Creative Commons Attribution/Share Alike 4.0.10 Where possible, the original (primary/rough) data must be archived, together with the scripts used to transform and analyse the data.   \\nFor maintenance purposes and to ensure long-term accessibility, data files should be archived in ‘sustainable’ file formats, where possible. The Faculty of Humanities uses the DANS list for this purpose.11   \\nAll individuals whose names are recorded in the data package are also identified by a persistent identifier in addition to their first and surname. The Faculty of Humanities uses ORCID as the identifier for individuals12.   \\nIn principle, data are archived for a period (the retention period) of at least ten years in a data package.   \\nIf data have been archived in YODA, the faculty independently decides at the end of the retention period whether the data should be archived for a longer period and at which location.   \\nAfter the data have been archived in a data package, the metadata of the package are published (in other words the metadata are distributed) and the data package is assigned a unique identifier. This occurs automatically in most repositories at the time of archiving. The Faculty of Humanities uses DOI as the persistent identifier for data packages.13  \\n\\n## III – Data management support  \\n\\nComprehensive support is available for data management in the form of information on the Research Data Management Support site.14 Templates for data management plans, standard processing agreements and other documents can be found on the website. Practical support can also be requested for all kinds of topics relating to data management, such as handling data within a consortium and the use of software.  \\n\\nPractical support can also be requested at the Faculty of Humanities. The first person to contact is the faculty data manager.  \\n\\n### Support at faculty level  \\n\\n- The data manager: Datamanagement.gw@uu.nl  \\n\\n- The Faculty of Humanities Research Support Office (RSO): rso.gw@uu.nl  \\n\\n- Privacy Officer for the Faculty of Humanities and the Faculty of Law, Economics and Governance: Joris de Graaf j.w.a.degraaf@uu.nl  \\n\\n- The Faculty Ethical Review Committee (FETC): fetc-gw@uu.nl  \\n\\n### Support at university level  \\n\\n- Research Data Management (RDM) support: info.rdm@uu.nl  \\n\\n## Links and more information  \\n\\nUniversity Policy Framework for Research Data (Utrecht University)   \\nNetherlands Code of Conduct for Research Integrity (KNAW, VSNU, NFU, NWO, TO2,   \\nVH)   \\nAlgemene Verordening Gegevensbescherming (AVG)   \\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)   \\nOnline tool for creating a data management plan (DMP Online)\",\n",
       " '# Faculty of Technology, Policy and Management Research Data Management Policy  \\n\\nJANUARI 2020  \\n\\n  \\n\\n## Preface  \\n\\nThe Faculty of Technology, Policy, and Management Research Data Management Policy is part of the central TU Delft Research Data Framework Policy. The Faculty of Technology, Policy, and Management Research Data Management Policy helps create effective practices for working with research data at the faculty, and defines data management roles and responsibilities of the different stakeholders within the faculty.  \\n\\nNote that the Faculty of Technology, Policy, and Management Research Data Management Policy only specifies the Roles and Responsibilities of faculty-specific stakeholders. TU Delft Research Data Framework Policy should be consulted about the roles of the Library, ICT Department, University Services and the Executive Board at TU Delft.  \\n\\nThis Policy is motivated by the belief that good data stewardship leads to research that is more time- and cost-efficient and it is inspired by principles that research data should be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR).  \\n\\n### This policy cultivates:  \\n\\n: Best practice for ensuring that scientific arguments and results are reproducible in   \\nthe long term.   \\n: Better exposure of academic work of researchers at TU Delft leading to recognition of quality of the research process as a whole.   \\n: Responsible management of research data, including the safe storage of research data and protection of intellectual capital developed by scientists across TU Delft.   \\n: Improved practices for meeting the demands of funders and publishers with respect to research data management and sharing.  \\n\\n### This policy recognises that:  \\n\\n: Individual departments and research groups have different working practices and processes and will therefore require dedicated guidelines – this document focuses on the aspects of research data management applicable to all departments. : Data management is the entire process of managing research data from its creation to its re-use and preservation and it is not equal to Open Science. While it is beneficial to publish research data openly, there might be valid ethical, legal or commercial implications, which will make data unsuitable for open sharing. . \"Relevant research data\" might mean different things in different disciplines. Source code, experimental notes, protocols, models, and other forms of information supporting traditional publication are also within the scope of this policy.  \\n\\nThe policy is applicable to all researchers of the faculty (PhD students, postdocs, researchers and project leaders). However, the research activities of students, such as bachelor and master students’ projects, are out the scope of this policy. In such cases, we encourage students and supervisors to follow the principles of this policy, but this does not constitute a requirement.  \\n\\n### The key points of this TPM Research Data Management Policy are:  \\n\\n. This policy is a refinement of the TU Delft Research Data Management Framework policy   \\n.

Freie Universität Berlin supports its members (researchers, instructors, and students) in implementing the relevant principles in alignment with the German Research Foundation’s Guidelines on the Handling of Research Data1 and Guidelines for Safeguarding Good Research Practice,2 Freie Universität Berlin’s Statute for Safeguarding Good Scientific Practice,3 Freie Universität Berlin’s Open Access Policy,4 the FAIR Data Principles\\u20095 as well as other recommendations6 regarding the entire research process, from data collection to the publication of research findings. Above and beyond these basic principles, Freie Universität Berlin believes that in the long term, research data are useful not only in a scientific context, but also have the potential to be used and distributed throughout society in accordance with the principles of open research (open science, open scholarship). The university encourages a culture of dialogue as a basis for developing quality assurance concepts for research data in the various departments and subject areas.  \\n\\n## 2 Scope  \\n\\nThis policy applies to all members of Freie Universität Berlin\\u20097 as well as to visiting researchers and guest lecturers, and partners and institutions with which the university holds a cooperation agreement. Where specific funding agreements with external funders stipulate other rules on data management, those rules take precedence. The binding policies of Freie Universität on data protection\\u20098 and IT security\\u20099 also apply.  \\n\\n## 3 Definition  \\n\\nThis policy applies to all research-related analog data, documents, and objects that are to be digitized in the course of a given research process as well as to “born digital” (i.e., originally created in a digital medium) data, documents, and objects produced in the course of a research process and/or that are the object or result of such a process. Research data are also defined as any data that facilitate the documentation, transparency, and – depending on the research area – replication of research outcomes (metadata).10  \\n\\nCommon examples of such research data are digitizations, audiovisual data, digital representations of analog data, measurement data, observation data, survey data, texts and text editions, databases, object collections, protocols, methodological test procedures, questionnaires, software, and simulations.11 The German Research Foundation (DFG) also defines source code and software as research data where they represent central outcomes of scientific research.12 The broad spectrum of data types reflects the diversity of scientific disciplines and their different research methods and processes.  \\n\\nIn the course of the research process, research data can take on several forms. They may vary in quality depending on how they are prepared or if additional data are added. The form of the data may also depend on the stage of processing, or they may be provided in different formats for presentation purposes. Furthermore, they may be subject to varying access regulations (open data, restricted data, closed data).  \\n\\nThe management of research data is an ongoing part of the entire research process. It includes the organization, documentation, storage, back-up, archiving, sharing, and publication of data. Research data management not only increases the visibility of the generated and/or processed data, but also the related research. It also helps to improve data quality and data processing, while making subsequent use of the data easier both for the original researchers and for others. Moreover, it facilitates the use of data in new contexts created when different data sets are linked. Sustainable research data management ensures the fulfillment of subject-specific requirements, as well as potential obligations related to funding agreements. It also helps meet publishers’ standards and requirements, as well as ensuring compliance with the principles of good scientific practice.  \\n\\n## 4 Handling Research Data  \\n\\nFreie Universität Berlin encourages researchers to structure and archive their research data and to make these accessible in accordance with the FAIR principles. These principles aim to make digital data more findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. Research data should be managed in a way that is compatible with the relevant subject-specific practices, with the principles of ethical research,\\u200913 and the guidelines and recommendations issued by professional associations in the relevant subject.14 Freie Universität Berlin adheres to the principles of the “Sorbonne Declaration on Research Data Rights,”\\u200915 and recommends that researchers work on the guiding principle of “as open as possible, as closed as necessary.”  \\n\\n### 4.1 Research and Project Planning; Administering and Managing Research Data  \\n\\nIt is recommended that project leaders include the costs of resources required to store and manage data (staff costs, project-specific hardware and software, charges for use) in grant applications. Even if funding institutions do not require it, Freie Universität Berlin recommends that researchers create a data management plan (DMP) as early as possible. The DMP should include details on how data will be collected, administered, secured, stored, used, and published. It should also include an agreement on data organization, the assignment of responsibilities, intellectual property,16 regulations regarding staff fluctuation, as well as specifications on data access. The data management plan should be reviewed regularly in the course of the research project and updated whenever necessary.  \\n\\nDescriptive metadata should be linked to the research data on an ongoing basis as an integrated part of the research project rather than waiting until the project is completed. It is also essential that the methods and tools used to generate, enrich, structure, and analyze the data are documented in full. This ensures compliance with quality standards, helps to keep the process transparent, and also ensures that the research can be replicated in accordance with the respective subject-specific norms. The University Library can help with choosing suitable tools for this process.  \\n\\n### 4.2\\t Publishing, Licensing, Storing, and Archiving Research Data  \\n\\nMachine-readable, processable research data can be deposited, referenced, and made accessible in different repositories. Depending on the project, researchers might choose a domain-specific repository, a subject-specific repository, or Freie Universität’s own institutional repository, “Refubium.”17  \\n\\nWhere intellectual property or data protection legislation or the principles of ethical research require restricting access to research data, Freie Universität offers technical archiving solutions.\\u200918 If there are reasons why research-relevant data are not to be stored, this should be documented in accordance with the recommendations on good scientific practice. If the research data are archived but not published, Freie Universität recommends that the metadata are deposited in Refubium to ensure the maximum visibility and long-term citability of research outcomes.  \\n\\nThe University Library assists members of the university in documenting and cataloguing their data for publication\\u200919 and in using sustainable and/or open standard formats\\u200920.  \\n\\nIf usage or publication rights are to be transferred, use of the data for academic purposes should be guaranteed on a perpetual basis. Freie Universität Berlin therefore recommends granting open licenses for use when data (including their metadata) are published, e.g., CC0 or CC BY\\u200921 for data, GNU General Public License\\u200922 or MIT License\\u200923 for source code. Data should be assigned persistent identifiers, e.g., Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs).  \\n\\nThe University Library offers this service free of charge.\\u200924 For the citation and/or referencing of data\\u200925 and software\\u200926, researchers should refer to established standards.  \\n\\nResearch data must be stored and made accessible for as long as required and possible according to the recommendations and rules of research funders within the framework of statutory and legal provisions (e.g., the EU regulations on personal data [GDPR], intellectual property law). The minimum time for which research data should be stored is usually ten years from the date of publication of the data or the relevant work and/or the end of the project.\\u200927 Freie Universität’s institutional storage systems (ZEDAT; Refubium) ensure that data are stored for at least this long.  \\n\\nIf research data are to be deleted from the institutional storage systems, then this must be done in agreement with the relevant researchers as well as the infrastructure providers (i.e., the University Library and ZEDAT) following the expiry of the required archiving period and in compliance with all legal and ethical requirements. The decision as to whether to retain or delete the data should take into account the interests and contractual obligations of external funders and/or other stakeholders, such as cooperation partners, participating research institutions, etc.  \\n\\n## 5 Legal and Ethical Considerations  \\n\\nResearch data management must always and at all times take into account the current statutory requirements, especially in relation to the protection of individuals and of intellectual property (copyright law, General Data Protection Regulation), as well as the requirements of this policy, subject to special arrangements with third parties (e.g., research groups, joint projects) and to ethical considerations.  \\n\\nThe ownership of usage rights is regulated in the employment contract between the researcher and Freie Universität and/or other specific agreements with the researcher. The rules stipulated in other agreements (funding agreements, cooperation agreements, research permissions) and the rights and standards applicable to the persons and groups, if any, who form the object of the research also apply. It may be necessary to carry out individual assessments of cases where ownership of the intellectual property in relation to the data is vested solely in the researcher(s) and/or specific research institutions.  \\n\\n## 6 Responsibilities  \\n\\n### 6.1 Research and Teaching  \\n\\nMembers of Freie Universität Berlin are bound by the principles of good research practice set out by the German Research Foundation (DFG). Freie Universität’s statute on safeguarding good scientific practice\\u200928 stipulates that researchers must ensure that the research data created and processed in the context of their research project must be, wherever possible, organized, documented, made accessible, and stored in a long-term and sustainable way. The researchers at Freie Universität are responsible for implementing the various rules and guidelines that apply to their research, including rules and standards issued by their respective departments and in consideration of all ethical and statutory requirements.29  Proper handling of research data is also highly relevant in the context of teaching and education. Members of Freie Universität do their best to ensure students and researchers for whom they have a responsibility are aware of the various methods of research data management applicable to their respective subjects\\u200930, whether this is in teaching and training (especially research-oriented teaching), research-based internships, projects, or final theses.  \\n\\n### 6.2 Institutional Obligations  \\n\\nThe University Library provides consultations on the organizational, legal, and ethical aspects of research data management, as well as on questions related to information science in this context. It offers support to researchers, especially in designing a research data management plan, and in selecting and implementing the best archiving and, where applicable, publishing strategy. Where researchers are dealing with more complex requirements, the Office of the General Counsel, the Central Ethics Committee, and ZEDAT also offer advice on finding tailored solutions for specific legal, ethical, and technical issues. The University Library also supports researchers through training in basic skills and norms in relation to research data management. It can advise the departments and other units in setting up and developing their own training programs, e.g., for Collaborative Research Centers (CRCs). ZEDAT offers one-on-one consultations for researchers along with workshops for small or large working groups on subjects such as computation for scientists, finding the right software, and identifying capacity needs, for example, for big data projects\\u200931.  \\n\\nThe Open Access Policy of Freie Universität Berlin\\u200932 encourages the idea that publishable research data should be accessible, and the university supports all researchers in making this possible as well as supporting recognition for data publications and developed software. The university strongly recommends that researchers consider and implement the relevant practices when handling research data in the context of assessing final theses and dissertations, in evaluations, and recruitment and appointment procedures. Freie Universität Berlin is also working toward the establishment of research data management as a core aspect of the curricula in all subject areas and in the courses offered by the central facilities as part of its endeavors to embed good scientific practice in all areas of the university.  \\n\\n## 7 Entry into Force  \\n\\nThis policy was approved by the Academic Senate of Freie Universität Berlin on May 5, 2021, and thereby entered into force.  \\n\\nThe University Library will be responsible for coordinating a review of this policy every two years with the participating central offices and committees to evaluate its validity in order to adapt it to new challenges, developments in infrastructure, and the needs of researchers.  \\n\\nCompliance with statutory and regulatory norms (including data protection legislation) is regularly monitored.  \\n\\nThe University Library is the point of contact for any questions related to this policy (forschungsdaten@fu-berlin.de).  \\n\\n## 8 References  \\n\\n‘§ 43 Mitglieder der Hochschule’. 2011.

       " 'Guidelines and recommendations on research data management at the Friedrich Schiller University Jena  \\n\\n20 december 2016  \\n\\n# Preface  \\n\\nAt the Friedrich Schiller University Jena (FSU) research data are regarded an essential resource for gaining scientific insights. The FSU strives to support its members with suitable research data management services. These services are provided by the central service facilities and will be continuously evaluated and enhanced.  \\n\\nThe present guidelines and recommendations supplement and specify the principles formulated in the \"Policy on the handling of research data at the Friedrich Schiller University Jena\". The Research Data Management Helpdesk serves as a central point of contact for all matters relating to research data. The website of the helpdesk1 provides the most recent information.  \\n\\n## I. Planning phase: before the research project  \\n\\nWhile planning a research activity in which data are collected or where data form the basis of your research, it is highly recommended to examine the requirements and possibilities for efficient and sustainable research data management from early on. The Research Data Management Helpdesk is there to assist you in determining your individual requirements, find out about services and funding opportunities, and to develop a suitable strategy for your project.  \\n\\nThe Service center for research and transfer2 provides general advice on proposals for third-party funding. Coordinated programs of the DFG (e.g. SFBs, research groups) are supported by the office of the Vice-President for Research3.  \\n\\nIt is recommended, and also required by some funding organisations, to create and submit a data management plan (DMP). A DMP contains the requirements as well as the technical and organisational measures ensuring a sustainable handling of research data during, and after, the project life-time. Throughout a project the DMP serves as a reference and guideline. It may evolve over time if conditions or requirements change (keyword: living document).  \\n\\nMost funding organisations expect not only the long-term safekeeping of research data but also its publication. A suitable strategy should be determined in the proposal phase. Costs for research data management (e.g. labour, storage, publication), which cannot be covered by the university\\'s basic facilities, should be requested in the proposal. The university computer centre assists you in determining the necessary IT infrastructure and services.  \\n\\nWhile planning a research project, in particular, when publishing results, legal constraints apply and must be taken into account. Certain research data in the social sciences, life sciences and medicine, for example, are subject to strict conditions, such as privacy protection laws or require prior assessment by an ethics committee. Additionally, the protection of copyrights and legitimate interests of third parties must be ensured. It is recommended to clarify legal questions in advance while planning a research project. The legal department4 is there to advise you on these matters.  \\n\\n## II. Implementation phase: during the research project  \\n\\nStoring and processing, as well as collaborating on research data, should adhere to state-of-the-art IT principles. This includes, first and foremost, securing data in terms of accessibility, integrity (unaltered) and authenticity. For example, procedures for data backups and archiving need to be in place and secure data exchange platforms and versioning tools should be used.  \\n\\nIn terms of research data the university computer centre (URZ)5 provides (among other things) the following services. The services are offered partly free of charge as basic infrastructure or can be provided at net cost.  \\n\\nuse of network file systems (including data backup)   \\nmass storage (archive storage) including data mirroring   \\nrenting virtual servers (server hosting)   \\naccommodation of real servers (server housing)   \\nblock storage services for servers (virtual disks via a dedicated storage   \\nnetwork)   \\ndata exchange services   \\nversioning services   \\nlong-term archiving services (in cooperation with ThULB)  \\n\\nDetailed service descriptions are available on the URZ website.  \\n\\nThe reusability of research data is largely dependent on the availability and quality of accompanying metadata. Metadata is data about data and provides the context in which the data were created. As a rule of thumb, metadata should answer the classic six questions: Who? What? Why? How? When? Where? Metadata is a prerequisite enabling potential users to find data and assess its suitability for the intended use. Ideally, the description is structured and machine-readable. For this purpose, metadata standards and standardized terminologies exist in most disciplines. If these do not exist, generic standards, such as Dublin Core, MARC, or MODS, should be used.  \\n\\nIn the implementation phase of a project, datasets may evolve over several stages (e.g. by selection, aggregation, integration). It is good practice to label, document and keep the different versions at least for the duration of the project. Especially in the case of text-based data, the use of versioning tools (e.g. git, SVN) helps with the management of different versions.  \\n\\nIn collaborative projects or projects with large amounts of data, the use of dedicated software and infrastructure for data management is advisable. Operating these infrastructures usually requires additional resources, but they provide the advantage of a streamlined central management for research data. Finding and sharing research data is thereby facilitated, but should be governed by a data policy the project consortium agreed upon.  \\n\\n## III. Final phase: after completion of the research project  \\n\\nAccording to good scientific practice, research data must be archived and made available by the end of a project. In particular, public access has become a necessity in recent years in order to facilitate the traceability of research results as well as subsequent reuse of the data. It is recommended to publish research data following the principle \"as open as possible, as restricted as necessary\".  \\n\\nThere are various ways to publish research data. In addition to domain-agnostic repositories, a large number of discipline-specific repositories exist. To find a suitable repository for your research data, the portal re3data.org 6  provides extensive search and filter capabilities. In addition, there are special data journals for publishing research data. In some disciplines it is common practice to publish data as a supplement to the respective article. However, this form of data publication has the disadvantage that the data can only be found via the article and does not form an independent, citable publication object  \\n\\nWhen selecting a publication method, the following criteria should be taken into account: long-term availability (at least 10 years), allocation of persistent identifiers (e.g. DOI, URN), licensing and usage terms of the data, visibility and cost.  \\n\\nAs a member of the FSU, you may publish and archive research data with the Digital Library of Thuringia (DBT)7.  \\n\\nIf you published research data with an external repository, you are requested to register this publication with the Digital Library Thuringia, too.  \\n\\nIndividual websites (e.g. of projects, departments, employees) are generally not suitable for the publication of research data. The long-term availability of such websites is often not guaranteed and non-ambiguous identification (keyword: PID) and cross-referencing is limited.  \\n\\nWhen selecting the data to be published, the DFG (2015) recommends, \"Data should be made accessible at a stage of processing that allows it to be usefully reused by third parties (raw data or structured data).\" In particular, data that served as the foundation of a scientific article should be made public.  \\n\\nAs with scientific articles, research data should also receive a unique, persistent identifier (PID). A PID (e.g. DOI, URN) is typically provided by the repository or data journal at the time of publication. In order to mandate usage and exploitation rights of your research data, data should always be published with a corresponding license. The selected license should allow at least open access for scientific purposes. Specific requirements of the funding organisation or repositories may apply and need to be considered. Suitable data licenses are available from Open Data Commons8 or the Creative Commons9. In general, research data should be published as soon as possible. However, there may be reasons to publish research data with an embargo period. In this case, the data is submitted to the repository for archiving, but it is only accessible after the end of the embargo period. The researchers who are responsible for the data determine the length of the embargo period, unless otherwise requested by the policies and guidelines of funding organisations or the repositories. Embargo periods should not exceed 1-2 years after the end of the project.  \\n\\nVorstehende Handlungsempfehlung wurde am 20.

       " \"# FACULTY GUIDELINES RESEARCH DATA MANAGEMENT  \\n\\nApproved by the Faculty Board on November 10th, 2016  \\n\\nOn September 2nd, 2016, the UGent policy framework for research data management1 was approved by the Executive Board. This general policy framework is a guideline for the proper management of research data and defines the objectives, starting points and responsibilities to comply with this. Given the large differences between and within the different scientific domains, the faculties are given the authority to take initiatives. These initiatives must encourage and support faculty researchers with careful data management in accordance with the UGent policy framework. The guidelines below are therefore complementary to the general policy framework. While following these guidelines, legal, ethical and valorisation arguments must always be considered.  \\n\\n## Planning  \\n\\nAt the start of each research project or a series of related studies, a data management plan (DMP) is made available by the responsible researcher. To help, use can be made of the faculty template on DMPOnline.be. This DMP is kept up-to-date as the project progresses.  \\n\\n### Storage & preservation of research data  \\n\\nWhere possible, research data is stored (during a project) and preserved (after a project) on a central network drive (i.e.., a UGent share managed by DICT).   \\nThe researcher gives at least reading rights on the network disk to his hierarchical superior using the following functional sequence: doctoral student < (co-)promotor2/ZAP < chair department < chair CWO). With an eye toward the structured storage of research data, researchers are provided with 'best practice' examples. The objective is to use a uniform folder structure for each type of data.   \\nWhen a researcher leaves the university, he/she and his/her supervisor take the initiative to keep the research data and accompanying documentation available and accessible during the applicable preservation period.   \\nNon-digital research data should preferably be digitized. If this is not possible, it should be stored in the faculty archive for research data.  \\n\\n### Findability & comprehensibility of research data  \\n\\nResearch data are documented to such an extent that reproduction of the reported results and reuse of the data is possible.   \\nFor every publication of which the first author is a UGent employee, a data storage fact sheet is made. This is then added to Biblio and provided with the 'data fact sheet' tag3.  \\n\\n## Support  \\n\\nNovice PhD students are advised to follow the RDM workshop organized at the beginning of each academic year.   \\nFor advice and assistance with all aspects of good data management, you can contact the faculty Research Support Office (RSO).\",\n",

Introduction  \\n\\nThis policy outlines the approach of Glasgow School of Art in relation to research data management and curation.  \\n\\nWithin the context of this policy, research data should be interpreted as any material (whether digital or analogue) that underpins the production of research outputs.  \\n\\nResearch data means data in the form of facts, observations, images, computer program results, recordings, measurements or experiences on which a research output is based. Data may be numerical, descriptive, visual or tactile. It may be raw, cleaned or processed, and may be held in any format or media. Research data in the visual arts mirrors the complexity of the outputs, taking many forms including logbooks, journals, workbooks, sample libraries, sketchbooks, sets of images, video recordings, trials, prototypes, ceramic glaze recipes, found objects, and correspondence. Provenance information about the data might also be included: the how, when, where it was collected and with what (for example, instrument). This metadata facilitates later interpretation and re-use of data.  \\n\\nModern research and publishing environments provide increased opportunities to make research data openly available in order to:  \\n\\nvalidate research outputs increase and measure impact facilitate knowledge exchange communicate research to wider society  \\n\\nThe Glasgow School of Art recognises that its research data is a key asset that can be managed to maximise benefits to the individual researcher, wider society, our funders and stakeholders, and the School.  \\n\\n## 2. Principles  \\n\\n### 2.1 General  \\n\\n1. Research produced by the School’s researchers, staff and students should strive to achieve the highest standards of integrity and quality   \\n2. Research data will be managed in line with wider School policies, guidelines and standards, and the requirements of external funders  \\n\\n### 2.2 Communication and Dissemination  \\n\\n3. The Research Information Manager and Heads of Schools are charged with communicating this policy to their researchers, along with the importance of good data management in general  \\n\\n### 2.3 Management Plans  \\n\\n4. Research proposals should include research data management plans where appropriate. These plans will generally consider data capture, management and curation, storage, handling, retention, dissemination, and publication  \\n\\n5. Lead researchers are responsible for ensuring that research data management requirements are observed at all stages of a research project  \\n\\n6. The Research Information Manager will provide guidance and support to help researchers negotiate the deposit, storage, retention and dissemination of research data  \\n\\n### 2.4 Data Retention  \\n\\n7. Data should be retained intact in an appropriate secure format, normally for a period of 10 years from the date of publication, depending on funder requirements  \\n\\n8. Where retention is not required, data must be disposed of securely in line with Data Protection requirements  \\n\\n### 2.5 Deposit  \\n\\n9. Research data should deposited and retained in an appropriate institutional form, or national or international repository. Information about data which is retained outside of the RADAR institutional repository or the GSA Archives should be registered with the School.   \\n10. The Glasgow School of Art will provide mechanisms and services for storage, backup, registration, deposit and retention of research data assets appropriate to the formats and media.  \\n\\n## 3. Roles and Responsibilities  \\n\\nResearch data management bestows a number of obligations on both individual researchers and the School.  \\n\\n### 3.1 The Glasgow School of Art  \\n\\nThe Glasgow School of Art is committed to supporting its researchers by providing an environment that recognises and supports research excellence. The School aims to provide the highest quality support at all stages of the research process.  \\n\\nResearch Developers within the Research Office can provide advice and guidance on research bids, funding streams, and methodologies. The Research Information  \\n\\nManager within Learning Resources can provide guidance and support in the management and curation of research data, including access, maintenance, preservation and sustainability.  \\n\\n### 3.2 Individual Researchers  \\n\\nThe School expects individual researchers to:  \\n\\nUndertake research in line with the standards outlined in our Research Ethics   \\nPolicy   \\nWork within all relevant legislative frameworks, including Data Protection and   \\nHuman Rights legislation, particularly in relation to sensitive data   \\nSeek advice on data management from the Research Information Manager   \\nwhere required, particularly in order to identify key data for retention   \\nLiaise with IT Services to identify potential data storage requirements   \\nProvide metadata upon request to enable access and re-use   \\nSubmit research data to an appropriate institutional form, or national or   \\ninternational repository.

       " '# General policy plan on research data management at Hasselt University  \\n\\n## Introduction  \\n\\nThe sound management of research data is essential to high-quality and responsible scholarly research. Hasselt University sees to the quality of the research performed within the institution and by researchers affiliated to the institution. It has already undertaken various initiatives to warrant such high-quality and responsible research, e.g. by subscribing to the Code of Ethics for Scientific Research in Belgium and the European Charter for Researchers, by establishing a Commission on Scientific Integrity, and by drawing up the Integrity Charter. In addition, research data turn out to be key to uphold high-quality research. By implementing a policy plan on research data management Hasselt University aims to manage its research data in the best manner possible.  \\n\\nThis policy plan on research data management at Hasselt University outlines the basic principles and general guidelines for the secure, findable, accessible and understandable preservation, for the management, the reuse (if possible) and the (public) sharing and archiving of research data at Hasselt University for the purpose of (re)use, verification or data collection. It lays down a general framework within which researchers, employees and students at Hasselt University manage their research data in a high-quality manner. These basic principles and general guidelines are based on both national and international developments in the field of research data management, and should be read together with the related regulations and guidelines, as listed in attachment 1 to this policy plan.  \\n\\n## 1. Terminology  \\n\\nResearcher: refers to any natural person who is conducting scholarly and/or academic research and is registered at Hasselt University, both paid and unpaid, and including doctoral students.  \\n\\nStudent: refers to any student who is attending a bachelor or master programme, a preparatory or bridging course, an advanced master, a teacher training or postgraduate certificate programme, an internship, an exchange study programme or credit contract at Hasselt University.  \\n\\nHierarchical responsible: depends on the statute of the researcher and his/her position within the research and organizational structure of Hasselt University. The hierarchy can be described as follows:  \\n\\nAcademic staff members (AAP, BAP [PhD], ZAP) < PI research group / director research institute < Dean < Vice-Rector Research < Rector   \\nAdministrative and technical staff members (ATP) < Coordinator unit < Director < ViceRector or Administrator < Rector   \\nStudent < (co-)Supervisor < PI research group / director research institute < Dean < ViceRector Research < Rector  \\n\\nResearch data: refers to all data and objects – whatever their form or method – that are generated, collected or used in the context of any research project. As a result, this broad definition includes a wide array of types and formats of data, ranging from raw data to processed and even published data. It may refer to both digital and physical data, and to data generated by the researcher himself /herself (primary data) as well as to data obtained from third parties (secondary data).  \\n\\nExamples may include, but are not limited to: notes, surveys, figures, objects, audio-visual files, spreadsheets, databases, statistical data, geographical data, research software, simulations, samples (including biological material, personal data, patient data, etc.).  \\n\\nMetadata: refers to data that describe the characteristics of the actual research data as to be able to identify and retrieve the latter more efficiently, that reflect the structure and composition of the research data and that facilitate the management of research data.  \\n\\nFor example, the title of a dataset, the names and affiliations of the researchers involved, a persistent identifier, version number, the relationship with an existing research project or scholarly publication, the date of creation, the file format, the access rights, etc.  \\n\\nHigh-quality research data: research data are deemed to be high-quality, when they are accurate, complete, authentic, reliable, understandable, identifiable, documented, findable, accessible, securely stored and secured.  \\n\\nAnonymous (anonymized) research data: refers to research data that don’t relate to an identified or identifiable natural person or to personal data rendered anonymous in such a manner that the data subject is not or no longer identifiable.  \\n\\nPseudonymous (pseudonymized) research data: refers to personal data that are processed in such a manner that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organizational measures to ensure that the personal data are not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person.  \\n\\nPersonal data: refers to any information relating to an identified or (in)directly identifiable natural person. Examples include, without being limited to: name, address, telephone number, chassis number, email address, IP address, age, gender, origin, image, way of life, personal opinions, etc. Each researcher collecting and/or processing personal data, must comply with the regulations concerning the protection of personal data.  \\n\\nSpecial categories of personal data: refers to particular personal data that are more sensitive by nature. Examples include, without being limited to: personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health (including medical information), data concerning a natural person’s sex life or sexual orientation, and data relating to criminal convictions and offences.  \\n\\nRecord of processing activities: each controller and, where applicable, the controller’s representative, shall maintain a record of processing activities under its responsibility. Art. 30 GDPR lays down the information that this record should contain.  \\n\\nData minimization: refers to the fact that personal data shall be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed. As a result, researchers should, as far as possible, only process personal data that are necessary for their specified research purposes.  \\n\\nData Protection Officer (DPO): (s)he is a staff member of Hasselt University and is designated to supervise the processing of personal data on behalf of Hasselt University. The Data Protection Officer (DPO) monitors implementation of and compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation within Hasselt University.  \\n\\nConfidential research data: refers to research data that need to be treated confidentially on account of a third party (internal/external) agreement.  \\n\\nInventions: refers to research results, as described in article IV.48.§1 of the Codex Hoger Onderwijs. That is to say potentially patentable findings, breeding products, designs and models, topographies of solid-state products, computer programmes and databases that could be used for commercial purposes when being applied in industry or agriculture.  \\n\\nOpen data: refers to research data that can be freely (re)used and shared by anyone, subject to the requirements of attribution and share-alike.  \\n\\nStorage: refers to the recording of research data during the research (project).  \\n\\nPreservation: refers to the recording of research data after the end of the research (project). Longterm preservation, in addition, refers to the recording of research data beyond a certain period (e.g. five years) after the end of a research (project).  \\n\\n## 2. Scope  \\n\\nThis policy plan applies to all research data that are generated, collected, processed, preserved, archived or exchanged before, during or after the research project at Hasselt University by researchers within the framework of their affiliation to Hasselt University.  \\n\\nUnless explicitly stated otherwise, this policy plan likewise applies to students within the framework of their affiliation to Hasselt University.  \\n\\n## 3. Basic principles  \\n\\nThe basic principles of this policy plan on research data management are:  \\n\\n1. During the entire research data life cycle, each researcher at Hasselt University must store, preserve and manage his/her high-quality data, and make them as (publicly) available as possible for potential reuse. In addition, research data must be managed as required by third parties, including funders, collaborating partners and government agencies. Each researcher at Hasselt University must observe and implement the basic principles and general guidelines, as set forth in this policy plan on research data management, before, during and after each scholarly research project.   \\n2. This policy plan on research data management complements existing legislation and regulations, and further specifies contractual obligations, research ethics and integrity guidelines. Personal data can only be collected and used when essential for a specific research question.   \\n4. All research projects require a data management plan (see art. 6).   \\n5. Researchers must comply with the current guidelines regarding the correct use of his/her Hasselt University user account, as set forth in the Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). Access rights to certain data are granted following the Identity and Access Management (IAM) procedures. The premises and infrastructure of Hasselt University are only accessible for researchers and individuals with a valid access permission.  \\n\\n## 4. Support by Hasselt University  \\n\\n### 4.1 Collaboration  \\n\\nIn this policy plan on research data management, Hasselt University takes the lead by outlining the basic principles and general guidelines. Pivotal is the collaboration between Hasselt University, the researchers, the faculties, the research groups, the research institutes and the central administration.  \\n\\n### 4.2 Awareness  \\n\\nHasselt University commits itself to stimulate researchers to implement this policy plan on research data management by promoting and facilitating it.  \\n\\nThe central administration offers support by providing training, advice, guidelines and templates for managing research data and writing data management plans. In addition, the basic principles and general guidelines of this policy plan are further explained on the portal site of the university. Through the funds obtained from the Flemish Open Science Board, the central administration of Hasselt University also offers support to researchers of the Limburg Association of Higher Education (AUHL).  \\n\\n### 4.3 Support  \\n\\nBesides this policy plan on research data management, Hasselt University is working on guidelines in order to meet both the practical and the technical needs of researchers, faculties, research groups and research institutes. Because of the considerable differences in data types and related data handling practices and needs between and within the various scholarly disciplines in which research is performed at Hasselt University, this policy plan on research data management aims to provide a general framework upon which the various disciplines can build. To this end, researchers can call upon the data steward who is assigned to their specific discipline.  \\n\\n## 5. Management of research data  \\n\\nEach researcher should essentially take the responsibility for the optimal management of high-quality research data. This implies that each researcher ensures that all research data are provided with documentation and adequate metadata that are prerequisites to enable the understanding and reuse of these research data. In order to store and describe research data in a high-quality manner, Hasselt University offers support with the implementation of a selection of Electronic Lab Notebooks (ELN).  \\n\\n## 6. Data management plan  \\n\\nThe researcher must write an initial data management plan within six months of the official start of the research project. In this plan, (s)he will describe the procedures for collecting, storing, (re)using, accessing, archiving and destroying the research data before, during and after the research project. This initial data management plan should be updated throughout the project. A final version must be submitted after the end of the research project.  \\n\\nBoth the initial data management plan at the start and the final version after the end of the research project must be submitted to the Directorate Research, Library and Internationalisation at Hasselt University (rdm@uhasselt.be). In addition, an external funding agency can require to receive one or both versions of the data management plan.  \\n\\nEach data management plan must comply with the basic principles and general guidelines, as set out in this policy plan, as well as with the policy or requirements, as set out by third parties. To this end, Hasselt University provides the necessary tools that are available to all researchers at Hasselt University.  \\n\\n## 7. Relevant regulations  \\n\\nThe researcher is responsible for observing the relevant regulations. These include, without being limited to:  \\n\\nintellectual property rights;   \\nresearch ethics, as laid down, for instance, in the ALLEA European Code of Conduct; privacy legislation, including the General Data Protection Regulation nr. 2016/679;   \\nthe European Dual-Use Regulation nr. 428/2009;   \\nthe European Regulation nr. 511/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 on compliance measures for users from the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization in the Union, and The Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from Their Utilization to the Convention on Biological Diversity, 29 October 2010;   \\nthe Hasselt University Information Security Policy Plan;   \\nthe Acceptable Use Policy with regard to the security and the storage of data, as defined by the Information Security Committee of Hasselt University;   \\nany additional regulations, as laid down in agreements with third parties, and any additional requirements, as laid down in the regulations of external funding agencies (see attachment 1, §1).  \\n\\nIn case that the regulations of external funding agencies or the agreements with third parties contain more severe or specific requirements regarding research data management, these will prevail over the general guidelines and principles set out in this policy plan.  \\n\\n## 8. Security of personal and confidential research data  \\n\\nWhen research data contain personal or otherwise confidential information, the researcher should observe the following provisions. As a matter of fact, similar measures necessary to prevent access  \\n\\nby unauthorized parties should be taken to protect not only digital data, but also confidential information on physical carriers (e.g. survey responses on paper).  \\n\\nHasselt University provides tools that can be used by all researchers at the university. Through its portal site, the university offers technical and practical support.  \\n\\n### 8.1 Anonymizing research data  \\n\\nResearchers should always try to process anonymous research data as much as possible. Anonymized research data don’t relate to an identified or identifiable natural person; these personal data are rendered anonymous in such a manner that the data subject is no longer identifiable.  \\n\\nIt is advised to document the anonymization techniques used and the related risk analysis in detail, e.g. in a so-called ‘Anonymization Pseudonymization Plan’ (APP).  \\n\\n### 8.2 Pseudonymizing research data  \\n\\nResearch data containing personal information can be pseudonymized. The use of pseudonymized data is only allowed if the additional information on these pseudonymized data is kept separately and is subject to technical and organizational measures to ensure that the personal data are not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person.  \\n\\nIt is advised to document the pseudonymization techniques used and the related risk analysis in detail, e.g. in a so-called ‘Anonymization Pseudonymization Plan’ (APP).  \\n\\n### 8.3 Encrypting research data  \\n\\nResearch data should be encrypted as much as possible. That is to say that data should be encoded as to protect the information contained. It is advised to assign the task of encrypting to an expert at the Central Information Technology Service (CID).  \\n\\n### 8.4 Confidential research data  \\n\\nResearchers should always be aware of the implications of non-disclosure agreements protecting confidential research data, and should respect this confidentiality. When the researcher feels that certain research data should be treated confidentially although an agreement with the third party concerned is still lacking, (s)he is responsible for reporting this lacuna to Tech Transfer Office (TTO), so that an agreement can still be drafted.  \\n\\n## 9. Storage and preservation of research data  \\n\\n### 9.1 Basic principles  \\n\\nBefore, during and after a research project at Hasselt University, research data can be recorded in high-quality facilities as provided by Hasselt University. Through its portal site, the university offers technical and practical support.  \\n\\nHowever, in case research data are managed in external facilities, the researcher will clearly indicate this in the data management plan and clarify how, when and by whom these data can be consulted.  \\n\\n### 9.2 Storage and backup of research data during the research project  \\n\\nStorage of research data during the research project  \\n\\nPreferably, researchers make use of the facilities provided by Hasselt University (e.g. Google Drive). (S)He should use a shared storage platform (e.g. Google Shared drive). Via such shared platform, one should share his/her research data with his/her hierarchical responsible and, if applicable, with the members of the research group. The alternative of a personal storage platform (e.g. Google My drive) should only be used for personal (yet work-related) files, or if collaboration with partners within or outside Hasselt University is not necessary.  \\n\\nHowever, if researchers choose to make use of external facilities, they should first seek permission to do so via the IT Service Desk. In this case, the researcher himself/herself and his/her hierarchical responsible accept responsibility for the high-quality storage of the research data.  \\n\\nFinally, researchers are strongly discouraged from using media that are highly susceptible to damage and loss to store their research data, including e.g. local hard drives, external hard drives, USB drives, etc.  \\n\\n### Backup of research data during the research project  \\n\\nA backup is essential to safeguard important and valuable research data in case of loss of or damage to the data on the original carrier. If one makes use of the institutional facilities mentioned above, such backup strategy will be provided by default. However, if one chooses to make use of an external facility, the researcher himself/herself will be responsible for implementing a backup strategy. For more information, one should contact the Central Information Technology Service (CID).  \\n\\n### 9.3 Preservation of research data after the end of the research project  \\n\\nResearch data that were generated or collected within the framework of a completed research experiment or analysis, and that the researcher considers to be valuable for (re)use, verification, valorization or data collection, should be preserved. Moreover, when the research data are part of a scholarly publication or patent application, they must be preserved in any case.  \\n\\nResearch data should be preserved in their most original (or raw) condition in order to make (re)use, verification, valorization and data collection possible. In addition, the data should be preserved as far as possible in a standardized (that is, uniform) and safe manner and – if applicable – in accordance with international disciplinary guidelines. This implies that the researcher takes into account (legal) requirements on anonymization, pseudonymization and encryption, as set forth in §8. Similarly, the researcher should comply with the guidelines concerning data management, as formulated by the Information Security Committee (see attachment 1, §7). In addition, research data should always be accompanied by the documentation that is necessary to understand their origin, generation, collection, processing and analysis.  \\n\\nFor archiving research data after the end of a research project, researchers preferably make use of an external disciplinary database, next of the institutional repository or cloud-based facilities provided by Hasselt University, and finally of an external general database.  \\n\\n### 9.4 Preservation period  \\n\\nAfter the research experiment and analysis have been wrapped up, the raw research data that are relevant for (re)use, verification, valorization or data collection, must be preserved for a period of minimum five years, at least insofar as legal, contractual or disciplinary regulations don’t deviate herefrom. If the research data contain personal data, the researcher should always comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). If the research data are part of a publication, this term can be extended to a period of minimum five years after the official date of publication.  \\n\\nIn addition, if the costs for data curation are in proportion to the academic, socio-cultural or economic added value of the (relevant) research data, the latter can be archived for the longer term, that is after the minimum preservation period of five years has elapsed. Such long-term preservation is only decided upon in close consultation with the researcher or his/her hierarchical responsible.  \\n\\n### 9.5 Disposal of research data  \\n\\nResearchers should destroy research data that are not (no longer) relevant for (re)use, verification, valorization or data collection – at least insofar as legal, contractual or disciplinary regulations don’t deviate herefrom. Besides, researchers leaving Hasselt University should comply with yet additional measures, as set forth in §12.  \\n\\n### 9.6 Hasselt University Metadata Repository for research data  \\n\\nResearchers at Hasselt University are required to submit the descriptive metadata of their datasets resulting from research at Hasselt University, whether or not underlying a peer-reviewed publication, to the Metadata Repository. The latter is integrated in the institutional repository of Hasselt University (Document Server), in which researchers currently already deposit their publications and other research outputs.  \\n\\n## 10. Intellectual property rights to inventions  \\n\\nThe intellectual property rights to inventions belong to Hasselt University, with the exception of inventions by students. Researchers, with the exception of students, must disclose inventions to Hasselt University Tech Transfer Office (TTO), prior to any other disclosure. TTO is responsible for protecting (e.g. by filing a patent application) and valorizing (e.g. by granting rights of use to third parties) these inventions.  \\n\\nHowever, the researchers involved retain all moral paternity rights. In addition, in accordance with the AUHL valorization regulations, they are entitled to compensation in case their valorized inventions generate income.  \\n\\nOn the other hand, in case of inventions by students, intellectual property rights belong to the student himself/herself, as is set out in the ‘Regulations concerning the rights to research results and rights to copyright works of bachelor’s and master’s students at Hasselt University, tUL and partner institutions in a joint study programme’.  \\n\\nIf students produce inventions that are part of research at Hasselt University, arrangements should be made so that Hasselt University is able to protect and valorize these inventions, or otherwise. In this case, the supervisor of the student should inform TTO in time.  \\n\\n## 11. Reuse of research data  \\n\\n### 11.1 Reuse by a third party  \\n\\nWhen a researcher at Hasselt University requests to use the research data of another researcher at Hasselt University, the hierarchical responsible of the latter researcher is authorized to grant or deny access. The hierarchical responsible tries to discuss this first with the researcher as far as possible before granting access. In this regard, the interests of the researcher at Hasselt University will always prevail. Supplementary conditions upon which access is granted, can be added by the hierarchical responsible.  \\n\\nWhen an external party requests to use the research data of a researcher at Hasselt University, or, conversely, a researcher at Hasselt University requests to use the research data of an external party, TTO should be informed in order that the proper written agreement can be drafted, in accordance with the Hasselt University Delegation Act (see attachment 1).  \\n\\n### 11.2 Public sharing  \\n\\nExamples of public sharing include: depositing research data in publicly accessible databases or repositories, presenting research data at conferences (unless the conference takes place within a closed network and a confidentiality agreement was concluded), sharing research data via social media, publicly exhibiting art works, etc.  \\n\\n## 12. Researchers leaving Hasselt University  \\n\\nResearch data that are collected and/or generated within the framework of a research project at Hasselt University, must be preserved and remain accessible for the appropriate period of time by the hierarchical responsible of the researcher leaving Hasselt University, unless contractual agreements with third parties deviate from this principle.  \\n\\nAs set forth in §10 of this policy plan, the intellectual property rights to inventions belong to Hasselt University, with the exception of inventions by students in a bachelor or master programme, or in a bridging or preparatory course. By consequence, a researcher is not allowed to take his/her invention with him/her upon leaving Hasselt University.  \\n\\nResearchers collaborating with other researchers or with third parties should make clear written arrangements concerning the management of the research data involved at the start of the research project. Such agreements concerning the management of research data in collaboration with external parties are laid down by the Tech Transfer Office, with regard for the Hasselt University Delegation Act.  \\n\\nIn case research data need to be disposed of, written consent by the researcher and by his/her hierarchical responsible is necessary. This written consent contains an elaborate motivation clarifying and approving both the specific datasets concerned and the reasons to destroy them. The researcher will provide the Central Information Technology Service of Hasselt University with this document. In addition, the destruction of the data itself should comply with applicable regulations (see attachment 1); the researcher leaving Hasselt University bears this responsibility.  \\n\\nFinally, the researcher leaving Hasselt University must observe the regulations concerning the processing of reusable and old devices, (research) data, media and documents, as drafted by the Information Security Committee, in order to prevent that the data that are stored on these devices should fall into the hands of unauthorized parties (see attachment 1, §7).  \\n\\n## 13. Sanctions in case of non-compliance  \\n\\nEach researcher is essentially responsible for complying with this policy plan and with the guidelines listed in the attachment. (S)He will be severally liable in case these are not observed.  \\n\\nIn addition, the Data Protection Officer is empowered to take measures internally in case of noncompliance with this policy plan, in particular with regard to the protection of personal data.  \\n\\n## Attachment 1 to the General policy plan on research data management at Hasselt University: Related regulations and guidelines  \\n\\nThe policy plan on research data management at Hasselt University should be read together with:  \\n\\n1. The guidelines and documents that are available on the website of the Directorate Research, Library and Internationalisation of Hasselt University.   \\n2. The Code of Ethics for Scientific Research in Belgium.   \\n3. The European Charter for Researchers.   \\n4. The Integrity Charter of Hasselt University.   \\n5.

       " '# Research Data Policy of the  Helmholtz Center Munich  \\n\\n## 1. Introduction  \\n\\nHelmholtz Zentrum München, Deutsches Forschungszentrum für Gesundheit und Umwelt GmbH (hereafter Helmholtz Munich) recognizes the fundamental importance of research data and encourages all scientists to apply the highest standards when handling these data within their projects (for the definition of \"research data\" see 8.1. 3). This implies that accurate and easily retrievable research data must be an integral part of any research project at the center so that it reflects the scientific culture of our research activities recognized in society and in the scientific community. A generally binding research data policy is not only necessary for the verification and validation of research results, but also forms the basic prerequisite for open, transparent and networked science (Open Science Policy).  \\n\\nDue to the dynamics of the use of new analytical instruments, research data from current and also from already completed projects can generate additional value for future scientific projects. However, this can only be realized and protected if the data obtained is already protected against loss during the course of the project and if it remains reusable for future projects thanks to its format, the link with corresponding metadata and the assignment of persistent identifiers (DOI). Securing the research data obtained at the center for subsequent use is an essential prerequisite for future innovative (meta)analyses, e.g. to gain new knowledge on the complex interactions between environmental factors and human health.  \\n\\n## 2. Aim of this Research Data Policy at Helmholtz Munich  \\n\\n• The aim of securing the research data obtained at the center so that it can be reused for future projects is being pursued in the knowledge that the center\\'s material and financial resources are provided by the public sector. Therefore, the center feels obliged to use the research results obtained with the greatest possible potential for broad application in society.  \\n\\n• With the implementation of a generally applicable research data guideline, including appropriate regulations for standardization, maximum synergy effects should be achieved by creating the basis for linking data sets from different projects.  \\n\\n• In particular, the research data guidelines also ensure that the research data already obtained at the center can be reused for future scientific questions (1, 2).  \\n\\n• A generally applicable research data guideline for the Helmholtz Zentrum München facilitates cooperation with research institutions in Germany and abroad and increases the visibility of the center in the international science community through the principles of Open Science (2, 3).  \\n\\n## 3. Scope of this Research Data Policy  \\n\\nThe following guideline for handling research data applies to all employees of the Helmholtz Zentrum München, regardless of how the respective research project is financed (basic funding or funding by grants). It is also used - within the framework of the respective contractual agreements - for research data that was / will be obtained in the context of cooperation with external partners.  \\n\\nAll employees of the center must follow this guideline when handling research data, regardless of the legal basis of their employment (as permanent researchers, employees on temporary projects, visiting scientists, scholarship holders, etc.).  \\n\\nThe Center\\'s current guidelines on data protection and information security, as well as the guidelines on the storage of and access rights to research data, take precedence over this guideline. In particular, research data as carriers of intellectual property may require protection (IP guideline of the center). Your exploitation rights by the center or third-party donors have priority over their publication (see 8.1.6) and must not be jeopardized by an open data culture.  \\n\\nExceptions to the research data guidelines can only be granted in justified cases. They always require verification/approval by the INNO and SPR departments.  \\n\\n## 4. Research Data Management  \\n\\nResearch data management covers the entire life cycle of research data, from the creation of a data management plan (DMP) to the collection of primary data, their validation, aggregation to permanent archiving and their publication.  \\n\\nResearch data must be recorded in accordance with the relevant standards of the respective research discipline, stating the tools and methods used to generate and process them. These metadata records contain descriptions of the data context in the long term and to publish them if necessary. Your archiving should be retrievable, readable, exchangeable and reusable according to the four premises of the FAIR data standard (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable) (4). The link to their metadata should be made using the established and standardized terminology of the relevant discipline, taking into account the possibility of interdisciplinary reusability and interoperability (5).  \\n\\nThe handling of research data within the framework of defined projects follows the DMP, which is created before the project begins (6). The planned type of research data, its acquisition, storage and access options to the data are to be specified in the DMP and the respective responsible parties are to be named. In the case of technical or methodological changes in the data flow during the course of a project, the DMP must be adapted. In the case of third-party funded projects, the costs incurred for the implementation of the DMP must be taken into account as eligible expenses when applying for funding. The project funding department of the SPR department advises applicants, e.g. B. on the basis of data management plans already established in other projects.  \\n\\n## 5. Responsibilities  \\n\\n### 5.1 Every researcher is responsible for:  \\n\\nA. the administration and management of research data (sets) in accordance with the principles and requirements of these guidelines and in accordance with the rules for ensuring good scientific practice of the Helmholtz Zentrum München (7), B. the collection, documentation, archiving and protection against loss of research data including researchrelated records (metadata). For this, the corresponding DMP is to be used, which specifies standard operating procedures that define the collection, administration, integrity, confidentiality, storage and publication of the data obtained.  \\n\\nC. Compliance with the general guidelines of the center, in the case of third-party funded projects, also the guidelines of the sponsors, and in the case of cooperation projects with external (research) partners, the relevant contractual regulations. The special requirements of the specific individual case must be specified in the DMP.  \\n\\n### 5.2 Each project leader (PL) is responsible for:  \\n\\nA. The creation and implementation of the data management plan (DMP) for the respective project. In addition to technical questions regarding the collection, administration, integrity, confidentiality, storage and publication of the data, compliance with the general guidelines of the center and the sponsors must also be taken into account in order to - wherever possible -  \\n\\nB. to ensure the reusability and exchangeability of the research data after the end of the project. In particular, this includes the definition of data reuse rights with the assignment of appropriate licenses, as well as the clarification of data storage and archiving with persistent DOIs after the project has been completed.  \\n\\nC. the possible specified destruction of research data and research-related records for data that falls within the scope of the European data protection BER as personal data (patient data, test person data (cohorts)). This also applies in particular to the revocation of consent by data subjects.  \\n\\nD. The provision of suitable resources (technical / organizational) to enable FAIR-compatible data management for all employees within the project.  \\n\\n### 5.3. Helmholtz Munich / Research Data Management (RDM) / HA DigIT  \\n\\nA. For research data management, the center provides support through RDM and other participating units (INNO, RA, ZB, SPR project funding) in the form of regular training, targeted advice (including questions about IP, ethics, etc.). Software is available for the standardized creation of DMPs.  \\n\\nThe use of \"electronic laboratory notebooks\" (ELN) is supported to create valid and high-quality research (meta)data and minimize data loss.  \\n\\nB. The technical requirements for long-term archiving of research data and the associated metadata (research data repositories) are provided by the center.  \\n\\n## 6. Publication of scientific findings including Research Data  \\n\\nResearch data should be made publicly accessible (publications, patents, etc.) immediately after they have been used for the first time by researchers at the center, unless there are significant reasons to the contrary. These can be, for example, legal or contractual regulations or the use of data from other research projects with a non-permissive license, the protection of intellectual property or the intended use of the data as part of technology transfer. The scope of the intended initial use must be specified in the respective DMP. In the case of contracts with external cooperation partners and guest scientists, care must be taken to ensure that no contractual commitments are entered into that would stand in the way of the publication of results involving the center. Advice on this may be provided by SPR project funding and/or the LA department.  \\n\\nWhen it comes to making the research data accessible after initial use (for instance in the form of a peer reviewed research paper), the focus is on traceability and reusability of the data in accordance with the FAIR principles (see above). For this purpose, the research data repositories of the center or external repositories are to be used. The Helmholtz Zentrum München provides tools for this and advises the project leaders on how to use them.  \\n\\nIf the research data is made publicly accessible, this should be done under a CC-SA  license if possible. As far as is feasible, data that has not yet been published but is worthy of publication should subsequently be made freely accessible and - linked to a DOI - published in the form of citable data publications. The DOI is assigned by the central library of Helmholtz Munich.  \\n\\n## 7. Annex  \\n\\n### 7.1 Definitions  \\n\\n#### 7.1.1 Data Management Plan (DMP)  \\n\\nIn order to ensure sustainable data management, a data management plan (DMP) must be drawn up before the start of a research project. It is intended to ensure systematic and permanent handling of the research data generated as part of a research project. In addition, he goes into the copyright, usage, access and first exploitation rights as well as storage during and after the end of the research project.  \\n\\n#### 7.1.2 Researcher/Scientist  \\n\\nScientists are all employees of the research center who are active in research and have a university degree, including bachelor’s and master’s students and guests with the appropriate qualifications.  \\n\\n#### 7.1.3 Research Data (RD)  \\n\\nResearch data is all data that is created during the research process, is used for it or is the result of it. Depending on the specific research question and using various methods, they are generated or collected, observed, simulated or derived, then processed, validated, further processed, analyzed, published and finally archived. Accordingly, research data occurs in every research discipline and depending on the stage of its life cycle in different media types and formats, aggregation and quality levels. Research data that form the basis of a publication are part of the scientific output of the center\\'s scientists.  \\n\\n#### 7.1.4 Metadata  \\n\\nMetadata describe research data. On the one hand, they include authorship(s), contact details of the originator (organization), time of creation, licenses and keywords. They define the data formats used and contain the context that led to the data. In addition, metadata can include device settings, environmental conditions (e.g. temperatures, pressures), comments and measurement uncertainties. Metadata are essential for the subsequent use of research data. In addition to use for further research work, this subsequent use also includes verification of research results by third parties.  \\n\\n#### 7.1.5 Research Data Management (RDM)  \\n\\nThe term research data management refers to the handling of research data from planning, generation and processing to publication, long-term archiving and, if necessary, deletion in compliance with the rules for safeguarding good scientific practice and the European GDPR. The management of research data therefore affects the entire life cycle of research data.  \\n\\nIn addition, the term includes the subject-specific documentation of the processes in the context of their collection. DMP facilitate the documentation of these processes and the description of the data.  \\n\\n#### 7.1.6 Protection of Intellectual Property and the priority right for RD exploitation  \\n\\nThe need for protection and the exploitation rights of intellectual property (IP) are defined in the employment contract between the researcher and the center as worker or host and are described in detail in the current IP guideline of the center. Copyright and exploitation rights to all forms of intellectual property can be expanded or specified by further agreements (e.g. third-party funding contracts).  \\n\\nIn principle, Helmholtz Munich has the right to decide how research data can be published and shared as a carrier of intellectual property. The treatment of all research data according to the FAIR principles represents the basis for publications and data exchange, but does not enforce the latter. The need for protection of the intellectual property resulting from the research of the center has priority over the exchange of data within the framework of a future open science policy.  \\n\\nThe first use of research data is usually one or more text publication(s) in a journal based on this data. The scope and duration of the initial use can be determined by the scientists in the DMP. In particular, the end of the initial exploitation phase should be determined in a context-dependent and justified manner.  \\n\\n#### 7.1.7 Data Publication  \\n\\nData sets can be published in two ways:  \\n\\nA. by simply making them available via a web interface, preferably at a local data repository of Helmholtz Munich,  or via a citable, dedicated  data publication (linked with a DOI). Such a data publication can include the open distribution of the data and metadata, but does not have to.  Instead it can also  show a simple \"landing page\", which broadly describe the context and content of the data set and via which interested parties can submit a request to the respective decentralized data manager (see above under \"Responsibilities and responsibilities\") for data release.  \\n\\nA central technical tool for the publication of research data is a data repository, a server service on which data can be stored by its creators. This data is given a globally unique identifier (e.g. a DOI) and can be searched and, if necessary, downloaded. A restriction of access by the data producer(s) by means of authorization settings is possible depending on the respective repository.  \\n\\n#### 7.1.8 Licences  \\n\\nThe license of a publication is a contract between the publishing and re-using person or institution, which regulates the conditions of re-use. Many license \"types\" are already pre-formulated and are available on the Internet, so reference is made to them here (8). A permissive license restricts subsequent use only minimally. Well-known examples of permissive licenses are CC-00-SA and CC-BY of the Creative Commons.   \\n→ CC-0:     \\n→ CC-BY:    \\n\\n### 7.2 Legal Status of Research Data  \\n\\nOwnership of data does not exist in Germany. However, copyright guarantees everyone the protection of their intellectual creations. Whether research data is subject to the protection of copyright law depends on whether the requirements for the level of intellectual creation or the requirements of database law are met. Both requirements are not regularly met for research data colelcted in routine measurements. Depending on the type of collection, research data can have a level of intellectual creativity that is worthy of protection. In order to ensure legal certainty, it should always be assumed that it is worthy of protection, that is rights of use and exploitation are usually to be clarified contractually with external partners. Careful licensing of published data must also be ensured.  \\n\\nRegardless of the right to the data obtained, the question of the right of exploitation must be seen. The researcher or the research institution can assert a (temporary limited) right of first use of the data obtained as part of their research activities in the form of publications or patents.  \\n\\n## References  \\n\\n(1) Strategiepapier des Forum Gesundheitsforschung des BMBF „Nutzbarmachung digitaler Daten für KI - und datengetriebene Gesundheitsforschung“, Berlin 2020   \\n(2) Berliner Erklärung über den offenen Zugang zu wissenschaftlichem Wissen, Helmholtz Open Science 2003, :     \\n(3) Positionspapier des Deutschen Wissenschaftsrates „Digitalisierung und Datennutzung für Gesundheitsforschung und Versorgung“, Köln, Juli 2022   \\n(4) Wilkinson, M.

       " '# HUMBOLDT-UNIVERSITAT ZU BERLIN  \\n\\n## Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin Research Data Management Policy  \\n\\n### Preamble  \\n\\nHandling of research data responsibly is critical for confirming research results, for the advancement of science and for the dissemination of knowledge. This policy is addressed to all researchers at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin both in their role as independent researchers, and as teachers and supervisors. Their obligation includes instructing students and doctoral candidates about handling of research data properly, as well as imparting subject-specific skills and standards.  \\n\\n### What is research data?  \\n\\nResearch data means all data that was created in the course of research or results from it. Since the generation or collection of research data depends on a variety of research questions and methods, followed by processing, analysis and publishing and/or archiving, the data may involve a range of media, aggregation levels and formats. Sharing and reusing research data requires documentation about the original context and about tools that were used.  \\n\\n## Policy  \\n\\nTo further the Proposals for Safeguarding Good Scientific Practice of the German Research Foundation, and the Rules of the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin for Safeguarding Good Scientific Practice and Investigating Allegations of Scholarly Misconduct (Satzung der Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin zur Sicherung guter wissenschaftlicher Praxis und zum Umgang mit Vorwürfen wissenschaftlichen Fehlverhaltens, in German) the University adopts following policy:  \\n\\n1. HU researchers are committed to the secure storage, processing, documentation and preservation of their research data for the long term. Responsibility for ensuring these processes lies with HU staff in charge of research projects or programmes.   \\n2. All HU researchers are encouraged to process research data resulting from their research activities according to the conventions and standards of their respective scientific community. They should document the complete research lifecycle including tools and procedures that they used.   \\n3. HU researchers should take responsibility for deciding at what time and on what legal terms research data may be accessed. The Open Access Declaration of the HU (Open-Access-Erklärung der Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, in German) recommends making research data as well as scholarly publications publicly available in a timely manner. Protection of personal data, copyrights and the legitimate interests of third parties must also be ensured.   \\n4. Research data underlying scholarly publications should be archived for the long-term and/or published in an appropriate trustworthy data archive or repository. They count as scholarly research output at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin.  \\n\\nHumboldt-Universität zu Berlin has commited itself to establishing the means to enable this policy to be fulfilled.  \\n\\nThis research data management policy was approved by the Academic Senate on 8th of July 2014.  \\n\\nPlease note that this translation is made available in addition to the original version of the “Grundsätze zum Umgang mit Forschungsdaten an der Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin”. Only the German version is authoritative.',\n",
       " '# RESEARCH DATA MANAGEMENT STRATEGY MARCH 2023  \\n\\n## I.    Introduction  \\n\\nIn March 2021, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) launched the Tri-Agency Research Data Management Policy. This policy seeks to support Canadian research excellence by promoting sound data management and data stewardship practices to ensure “that research makes good use of public funds, experiments and studies are replicable, and research data are available for reuse where ethical, legal, and commercial obligations allow.”1 The agencies recognize that standards for Research Data Management (RDM) vary across disciplines, areas of research, and modes of scientific and scholarly inquiry.  \\n\\nThe RDM Policy requires all postsecondary institutions and hospitals eligible to administer Tri-Agency funds to develop an institutional research data management (RDM) strategy that reflects the institution’s size, research intensity, and existing RDM capacity. Additionally, the Tri-Agency RDM Policy, establishes new data management requirements for researchers applying for federal funding. For  certain funding competitions, the agencies will require data management plans (DMPs) to be submitted during the application process. The quality of these plans will be considered in the merit review process. Further, after reviewing the institutional strategies and in step with the readiness of the Canadian research community, the agencies will phase in a data deposit requirement. The RDM policy acknowledges that “determining what counts as research data, and which data should be preserved, is often highly contextual and should be guided by disciplinary norms.”2  \\n\\n## II.   Importance of Research Data Management  \\n\\nRDM enables researchers to organize, store, access, reuse and build upon digital research data. RDM is essential to Canadian researchers’ capacity to securely preserve and use their research data throughout their research projects, reuse their data over the course of their careers and, when appropriate, share their data. Furthermore, as an acknowledged component of research excellence, strong RDM practices support researchers in achieving scientific rigor and enable collaboration in their fields (Tri-Agency Research Data Management Policy - Frequently Asked Questions).  \\n\\n## III.   Institutional Context  \\n\\nHuron University College’s RDM strategy reflects its current research activities, intensity, and context as a small undergraduate liberal arts university, affiliated with a large research-intensive university. Research and research-learning are vital to the culture and mission of Huron University. Huron is committed to research excellence and recognizes that strong research data management is a key component of research excellence.  \\n\\nData management planning and the new Tri-Agency requirements represent a significant change for Huron researchers and for the institution. We are in the early stages of creating the supports and awareness necessary to foster a culture of research data management. Huron recognizes data as an important research output and is committed to promoting responsible RDM that will enable our researchers to establish and implement RDM practices most appropriate to their disciplinary context.  \\n\\nHuron will support researchers in adopting the FAIR Principles to make research data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. The FAIR principles are complemented by Tri-Agency Framework: Responsible Conduct of Research and the TCPS 2 (2022), which provides guidance on data management in areas of consent, privacy and confidentiality, and secondary use of data.  \\n\\n## IV.   Indigenous Data Considerations  \\n\\nHuron is committed to decolonizing our curriculum, practices, and relationships with the Indigenous peoples of Canada and particularly of southwestern Ontario. This includes research conducted in partnership with First Nations, Métis and Inuit communities, collectives, and organizations. Huron recognizes that Indigenous communities themselves must “guide and ultimately determine how the data are collected, used and preserved, and have the right to repatriate the data.”3 Huron is committed to working in partnership with Indigenous stakeholders to implement a distinctions-based approach to ensure that the unique rights, interests, and circumstances of First Nations, Métis, and Inuit peoples are acknowledged, affirmed, and implemented  \\n\\nHuron supports the use of data management practices, such as the First Nations Principles of OCAP® (Ownership, Control, Access, Possession), and the CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance (Collective benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, Ethics), to support Indigenous data sovereignty. In addition, Chapter 9 of the TCPS 2 (2022) details considerations in research with Indigenous Peoples. Huron’s Indigenous Initiatives Coordinator is a key resource in ensuring appropriate and meaningful application of RDM principles and strategies to Indigenous data.  \\n\\n## V.   Ethics Considerations  \\n\\nResearch projects involving human participants are reviewed by Huron’s Research Ethics Board. The REB has recently incorporated research data management in the application form for ethics approval.  \\n\\n# VI.  Scope  \\n\\nThis strategy applies to all faculty, staff, and students who conduct research at Huron. It also applies to any person (including, but not limited to, affiliated faculty, visiting professors or students, adjunct professors and postdoctoral associates and fellows) appointed or invited to engage in research activity at, or under the auspices of, Huron.4  \\n\\n## VII.  Oversight and Review  \\n\\nThe Office of the Provost, with support from the Coordinator, Research & Learning, is responsible for the development and implementation of the RDM strategy. As a living document, the RDM strategy will be revised on an ongoing basis in consultation with Huron researchers, Library and Learning Services, Information Technology Services, the Research Ethics Board, and other institutional stakeholders.  \\n\\n# VIII.   Institutional Strategy  \\n\\nHuron wishes to foster a research data management culture where researchers are aware of data management planning tools, repositories, and resources and incorporate them throughout the research lifecycle. Our initial priorities are to increase awareness, support, and capacity for RDM practices, while leveraging, where appropriate, RDM resources available through Western University, the Digital Research Alliance of Canada (formerly Portage) and other organizations.  \\n\\n### Objective 1: Build RDM Awareness and Institutional Capacity  \\n\\nPromote the value and importance of data management   \\nIncrease awareness of the new Tri-Agency RDM requirements and the Tri-Agency Statement of   \\nPrinciples on Digital Data Management   \\nSurvey the Huron research community to evaluate current RDM practices, gaps, and capacity   \\nIdentify needs for data storage, data deposit, and data security   \\nDevelop and implement an institutional framework to support RDM  \\n\\n### Objective 2: Provide RDM Support and Training  \\n\\nDevelop a repository of resources focused on RDM needs in the social sciences and humanities Offer RDM workshops, Lunch and Learns, and other training opportunities Provide researchers with guidance to manage their data in accordance RDM best practices, including the development of data management plans for funding applications Increase awareness of RDM resources and training available through the Digital Research Alliance of Canada and Western Libraries, including the DMP Assistant and Borealis, the Canadian Dataverse Repository  \\n\\n### Objective 3: Support Indigenous Data Sovereignty  \\n\\nIncrease awareness of Indigenous data sovereignty, including the OCAP® and CARE principles Provide resources and training to support researchers in working responsibly with Indigenous partners and communities Collaborate with the Indigenous Initiatives Coordinator and Indigenous elders, knowledge keepers and communities to ensure that data are managed in close partnership with Indigenous communities  \\n\\n# IX.   Looking Ahead  \\n\\nHuron’s largest faculty, the Faculty of Arts and Social Science is about to launch a strategic planning exercise to develop its next five-year Academic Plan (2024-2029). The Faculty of Theology will embark on a similar process next year. It is anticipated that our institutional RDM strategy over the next five years will be informed by this work.  \\n\\n## APPENDIX A: DEFINITIONS  \\n\\n### Research Data  \\n\\nResearch data are data that are used as primary sources to support technical or scientific enquiry, research, scholarship, or creative practice, and that are used as evidence in the research process and/or are commonly accepted in the research community as necessary to validate research findings and results. Research data may be experimental data, observational data, operational data, third party data, public sector data, monitoring data, processed data, or repurposed data. What is considered relevant research data is often highly contextual and determining what counts as such should be guided by disciplinary norms (Tri-Agency Research Data Management Policy - Frequently Asked Questions).  \\n\\n### Research Data Management  \\n\\nResearch data management (RDM) refers to the processes applied through the lifecycle of a research project to guide the collection, documentation, storage, sharing and preservation of research data. RDM is essential throughout the data lifecycle—from data creation, processing, analysis, preservation, storage and access, to sharing and reuse (where appropriate), at which point the cycle begins again. Data management should be practiced over the entire lifecycle of the data, including planning the investigation, conducting the research, backing up data as it is created and used, disseminating data, and preserving data for the long term after the research investigation has concluded (Tri-Agency Research Data Management Policy - Frequently Asked Questions).  \\n\\n### Data Management Plan  \\n\\nA “data management plan” (DMP) is “a living document, typically associated with an individual research project or program that consists of the practices, processes and strategies that pertain to a set of specified topics related to data management and curation. DMPs should be modified throughout the course of a research project to reflect changes in project design, methods, or other considerations. DMPs guide researchers in articulating their plans for managing data; they do not necessarily compel researchers to manage data differently” (Tri-Agency Research Data Management Policy, Frequently Asked Questions, Government of Canada 2021).  \\n\\n### Data Deposit  \\n\\n“Data deposit” refers to when the research data collected as part of a research project are transferred to a research data repository. The repository should have easily accessible policies describing deposit and user licenses, access control, preservation procedures, storage and backup practices, and sustainability and succession plans. The deposit of research data into appropriate repositories supports ongoing data-retention and, where appropriate, access to the data. (Tri-Agency Research Data Management Policy, Frequently Asked Questions, Government of Canada 2021).  \\n\\n## APPENDIX B: POLICIES AND RESOURCES  \\n\\n### 1) External Policies  \\n\\nTri-Agency Research Data Management Policy:   \\n    \\nTri-Agency Statement of Principles on Digital Data Management:   \\n   \\ndata-management/tri-agency-statement-principles-digital-data-management   \\nTri-Agency Framework: Responsible Conduct of Research:   \\n    \\nTri-Agency Open Access Policy on Publications:   \\n    \\nTCPS 2 (2022) – Chapter 9: Research Involving the First Nations, Inuit, and Métis Peoples of   \\nCanada:    \\n\\n### 2)   External Resources  \\n\\nDigital Research Alliance of Canada, Research Data Management   \\n    \\nThe First Nations Principles of OCAP®   \\n    \\nThe CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance:   \\n    \\nResearch Data Management Terminology:   \\n   \\n\\n### 3)   Internal Policies  \\n\\nAcademic Integrity in Research Policies and Procedures   \\nInformation Technology Policy   \\nIntellectual Property Policy   \\nStatement of Principles on Research Involving Indigenous Communities   \\nStatement of Principles on Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion in Research   \\nResearch Ethics Board Policy and Procedures',\n",

INTRODUCTION  \\n\\nImperial College is committed to promoting the highest standards of academic research, including excellence in research data management. The College is developing services and guidance for its academic and research community in order to foster best practice in data management and to facilitate, by way of a robust digital curation infrastructure, free and timely open access to data so that they are intelligible, assessable and usable by others. The College acknowledges legal, ethical and commercial constraints with regard to sharing data and the need to preserve the academic entitlement to publication as the primary communication of research results.  \\n\\n### 1.1 Description  \\n\\n#### Application:  \\n\\nThe aims in this document apply to all data generated through research undertaken by Imperial College staff and students solely or in collaboration with others.  This includes, but is not limited to, research sponsored by grants or contracts awarded to Imperial College and where Imperial is a partner on awards held by other institutions.  \\n\\nThis framework will aid Imperial’s transition to best practice in Research Data Management and to compliance with funders’ requirements.  \\n\\n### 1.2 Aims  \\n\\nThe aim of this document is to provide a framework within which the College, through its academic and research community, and support services can adhere to the rules and mandates of its funding and regulatory bodies and to ensure that research data are maintained and preserved as identifiable, retrievable and reusable assets as part of the overall research project cycle.  This is achieved by allocating roles and responsibilities across the institution and will be reviewed once the College has finalised its analysis of requirements.  \\n\\nThis document supports academics retaining the choice of where to deposit their data and their entitlement to publish their findings first within the constraints specified by the funder (where one exists) though also taking account of the socioeconomic benefits of promptly sharing the outcomes of research.  \\n\\nManagement of data generated from a research grant or contract must also comply with the policies of the relevant grant funders.  Where these conflict with the College policy, the policies of the funders take precedence unless specified.  \\n\\nManagement of data obtained under licence must also comply with relevant licence agreements.  The terms and conditions of any licence agreements take precedence over this policy.  \\n\\n## 2. DEFINITIONS  \\n\\n.1 Research Data:  \\n\\nData that are collected, observed, generated, created or obtained from commercial, government or other sources, for subsequent analysis and synthesis to produce original research results.  For the purposes of this policy, this is limited to digital data.  \\n\\nShareable Research Data: The subset of Research Data that must be preserved for long-term storage and shared.  \\n\\n2.3 Data Management Plan (DMP):  \\n\\nPlans typically state what data will be created and how, and outline the plans for protecting against loss, sharing and preservation, noting what is appropriate given the nature of the data and any restrictions that may need to be applied.  More details are available on the College RDM webpages1.  \\n\\n2.4 Data Repository: A place where data may be stored and made available. This includes but is not limited to a College Repository, a discipline specific repository, a funder repository or a commercial system.  \\n\\n### 2.5 Funder:  \\n\\nAn organisation that provides a financial contribution to support a research project.  \\n\\n# RESEARCH DATA MANAGEMENT POLICY  \\n\\n2.6 Principal Investigator (PI):  \\n\\nThe person ultimately responsible for the research project; as such the PI takes responsibility for the intellectual leadership of the research project and the overall scientific and financial management of the research.  \\n\\n2.7 Digital Object Identifier (DOI): A reference that enables permanent identification and location of digital objects, such as datasets and journal articles. This means a reference to a dataset elsewhere (e.g. in the journal article it supports or in the College's catalogue) is not going to break or become outdated as a web address might do.  \\n\\n## 3. PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES  \\n\\n3.1 Principal Investigators have overall responsibility for the effective management of research data generated within or obtained for their research, including by their research groups. The Library and ICT will provide training, guidance and services to support PIs in the following roles and responsibilities.  \\n\\n3.2 Principal Investigators will provide a data management plan (DMP) for all research grant and contract proposals from the date mandated by the funder where applicable, and in any case by 1st January 2016. This should be in the DMP format provided by the funder if one has been defined, and otherwise the College standard format2 should be used. See 5.1 and 5.2 for details of the support provided by the Library for this task.  \\n\\n3.3 During the course of a research project, the PI must ensure their own and their group’s data (and use reasonable endeavours to ensure their collaborators’ research data) are stored and described in ways that will minimise the risk of loss and maximise the likelihood of future discoverability and re-use.  \\n\\n3.3.1 Minimum standards of data safety to be followed are published by ICT3.  \\n\\n3.3.2 ICT will provide shared network storage that complies with these standards (see 6.1).  \\n\\n3.3.3 Research data are to be accompanied by adequate metadata and/or documentation to facilitate its identification and re-use. See 5.1 and 5.6 for details of the support provided by the Library for this task.  \\n\\nPrincipal Investigators are responsible for identifying and preserving all their research data (whether shareable or not) that would be required to validate published research findings in the future.  \\n\\nPrincipal Investigators are responsible for determining what their shareable research data comprises in view of the considerations in 3.6. The minimum requirement is to share all relevant data to support and underpin published findings including e-theses.  Any funder requirements must also be met.  \\n\\n.6 Principal Investigators must deposit their shareable research data in a publicly-available repository of their choosing no later than the time of publication of the findings.  Where the funder requires deposit earlier, the timeframes specified by the funder take precedence.  Where the funder requires the data to be deposited in a different repository, the funder’s requirements must also be followed although deposit in multiple repositories is acceptable.  \\n\\n3.6.1 Publication – the PI’s entitlement to be the first to publish based on data they have generated must be preserved.  If the PI will not be able to publish their findings by the funder’s deadline for data sharing, the PI should request an extension of the embargo period from the funder.   \\n3.6.2 Copyright – the PI will not share any data that would infringe any right of title or copyright. Where third party research data are used, access conditions should be sought and followed and the source of that data will be acknowledged where required.  \\n\\n# RESEARCH DATA MANAGEMENT POLICY  \\n\\n3.6.3 Licences – the PI is entitled to select the licence under which they publish their data provided the chosen licence permits sharing and re-use in accordance with the appropriate funder’s terms and conditions (if any exist) and this policy.  \\n\\n3.6.3 Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) – the PI will not share any data that would infringe the IPR of others.  \\n\\n3.6.4 Commercial Interests – the PI is entitled to delay sharing of their data where early release may harm commercialisation opportunities arising from their research until appropriate protection is in place.  \\n\\n3.6.5 Privacy – the PI will take all appropriate steps to ensure the anonymity of any personal data prior to sharing.  For patient data, further requirements are detailed in “Data Protection Policy – Code of Practice 2: Handling of Patient Data”4 and must be met.  \\n\\n3.6.6 Ethical Concerns – the PI should bear in mind potential ethical considerations in making the decision to share their data.  \\n\\n3.6.7 Cost Effectiveness – where computer-generated data may be reliably recreated at a cost less than that of storing raw output data, then the inputs and human-readable outputs of the relevant programme may be stored instead along with a reference to or copy of the software version used.  \\n\\n3.6.8 Legal Safeguards – where data are shared with restrictions, e.g. if they identify human subjects, they would normally be stored in repositories located in the EU to prevent their full disclosure via Freedom of Information and Data Protection safeguards.  See 5.6 for details of the support provided by the Library for this task.  \\n\\n3.7 If software is developed as part of a research project, Principal Investigators must archive the particular version of the software used to generate or analyse the data in a repository and inform the Library of its location, taking account of the points raised in 3.5 above. Principal Investigators are encouraged to follow the Sustainability and Preservation Framework of the Software Sustainability Institute.5.  \\n\\nPrincipal Investigators will inform the Library of the location of their shared research data and specified metadata including the Digital Object Identifier (DOI) for that data package at the time of deposit.  \\n\\nPrincipal Investigators will ensure that all journal articles include a means to obtain the supporting data by referencing the appropriate DOI.  \\n\\n3.10 Appropriate funding for RDM should be requested at application stage where this is an eligible cost item allowed by the funder [TBC based on most effective means of covering these costs under FEC methodology].  \\n\\n.11 Principal Investigators will ensure that shareable research data are made publicly available for 10 years after publication or for the minimum period required by the funder if longer than 10 years.  \\n\\n3.12 If the PI leaves Imperial College or circumstances (such as death, incapacitation or leaving academia) mean the PI is no longer able to fulfil their responsibilities then:  \\n\\n3.12.1 If there is an Imperial College Co-Investigator, they inherit the responsibilities of the PI;  \\n\\n3.12.2 Otherwise, if the PI and the award move to another institution, the responsibilities follow the PI;  \\n\\n3.12.3 Otherwise, whom so ever is appointed by the department to complete any of the PI’s requirements for the research project will become the PI from an Imperial College perspective and as such inherit the responsibilities outlined in this section.  \\n\\n# RESEARCH DATA MANAGEMENT POLICY  \\n\\n## 4. FACULTY ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES  \\n\\n4.1 As part of the routine approval of grant applications, Faculty Research Services and Contracts / Joint Research Office will ensure that all research grant and contract applications include a DMP and that this is attached to the relevant record in the appropriate College management system.  They are not, however, responsible for ensuring the content is appropriate for the research.  \\n\\n4.2 Faculty Research Services and Contracts / Joint Research Office must ensure that data management responsibilities reflected in this policy are also applied to research partner organisations and the data they generate on research undertaken in collaboration with the College in research partner contracts.  \\n\\nFaculties are responsible for ensuring their PIs adhere to their obligations as detailed in this policy.  \\n\\n## 5. LIBRARY ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES  \\n\\n5.1 With the support of ICT, the Library will provide training and advice on all aspects of research data management including minimum standards of metadata description, the writing of DMPs, copyright and licences.  \\n\\nThe Library will provide guidance and support towards the generation of generic DMP templates to aid PIs, and will maintain a library of the latest recommended version(s).  \\n\\nThe Library will maintain a College data catalogue using the information provided to them.  \\n\\n5.4 The Library must be able to reassure the College that it has confidence in the longevity of any external repository used for data sharing purposes.  Where the Library is not confident in the longevity of a repository, Imperial data stored within it may be copied into an Imperial-approved data storage facility for safe-keeping.  \\n\\n5.5 The Library will publish sufficient appropriate metadata describing every shared dataset on a publiclyavailable catalogue for that dataset to be discovered, accessed, understood and re-used.  Where research is externally funded, the funder of the grant that generated the data and the funder’s grant reference number must be included within the metadata.  \\n\\n5.6 The Library will provide assistance in determining the physical location of discipline repositories where a dataset should not be shared without restrictions.  \\n\\n### INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY (ICT) ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES  \\n\\nICT will make available appropriately resilient storage for research data during their collection and throughout the data lifecycle.  \\n\\nICT will provide technical advice and support data management including data storage, backup and archiving.  \\n\\nICT will ensure a system is available for storing and sharing of research data for which there is no appropriate external publicly-available repository.  \\n\\nICT will support the Library in the technical aspects of development and provision of training and advice.  \\n\\nAt Library’s request, ICT will provide advice on if a repository is suitably robust and may need to facilitate copying of the data from this external storage to an approved storage facility should this not be the case.  \\n\\n6.6 ICT will ensure software to support effective research data management is available.  \\n\\n# RESEARCH DATA MANAGEMENT POLICY  \\n\\n## 7. RESEARCH OFFICE (RO) ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES  \\n\\nRO is responsible for quality assurance of the College’s research data curation processes.  \\n\\nRO is responsible for ensuring stakeholders understand their obligations.  \\n\\n7.3 RO is responsible for ensuring funder and College requirements are communicated to stakeholders.\",\n",

Introduction  \\n\\nThe Faculty of Geo-Information Science and Earth Observation (ITC) has committed to promoting open and transparent research practices. Proper Research Data Management (RDM) that is in accordance with FAIR data principles, i.e. ensuring findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable research data, is a key requirement to achieve this mission. Upholding the best research data management practices is essential for fostering efficient, reproducible, transparent, and highquality research.  \\n\\nBuilding upon the solid foundation provided by UT's overarching Research Data Management Policy, the policy outlined below provides tailored guidelines and the best practices specific to ITC.  \\n\\nThis ITC-specific policy is intended to ensure that all research data is handled with the utmost care by all ITC researchers and students in order to, among other things:  \\n\\nDemonstrate academic integrity, upholding transparency and ethical practices in research;   \\nSafeguard research data security and the privacy of research subjects;   \\nEnable research reproducibility, allowing for the verification and validation of academic findings;   \\nComply with relevant regulations, policies, and Code of Conduct regarding research data management, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), The Netherlands Code of Conduct for Research Integrity;   \\nEnsure the availability of data and facilitate the re-use of research data by the research community.  \\n\\n## 2. Scope of the policy  \\n\\nThis policy is intended for all members of ITC engaged in research activities, including master students and academic researchers (PhD candidates, postdoctoral fellows, researchers, and senior academic staff, i.e. assistant professors, associate professors, and full professors) and all other staff involved in the generation, collection, processing, and dissemination of research data. In accordance with UT’s RDM policy, it covers roles, responsibilities, and ITC’s working rules in accordance with the best RDM practices.  \\n\\nIn the subsequent sections, we will delve into specific aspects of RDM, including data management planning, data storage, data sharing and transfer, data documentation, preservation, and registration, and specific considerations regarding handling personal data in research. Each section will provide detailed working rules and information on the best practices for managing research data effectively.  \\n\\n## 3. Definitions  \\n\\nResearch data: the term ‘research data’ refers to all forms of information, commonly accepted in the academic community, that is collected, observed, generated, or created as necessary to validate research findings and conclusions. Examples include geospatial and remote sensing data, statistics, field and laboratory measurements, experimental and observational data, surveys, interviews, video and audio recordings, photos and images, analysis scripts, etc. (Kruse & Thestrup, 2018). Research data also include secondary documents such as policy reports and data obtained from literature review. Research data do not include the following materials: drafts of academic papers, plans for future research, peer reviews, or communication with colleagues.  \\n\\nResearch project: In this policy, a research project refers to a detailed study of a subject aimed to solve specific research questions or objectives. It involves the collection, analysis, and interpretation of data in order to discover new facts or develop new concepts, generate new findings, and instigate progress. Research projects explicitly include research carried out by master students and academic researchers (PhD candidates, postdoctoral fellows, researchers and senior academic staff, i.e. assistant professors, associate professors, and full professors).  \\n\\nData management plan (DMP): A DMP is a formal document that describes all data that are to be used in the project, the documentation and organisation of data, data storage during the research process, preservation of data after the project is completed, and finally, the future availability of data for sharing and re-use. The DMP should also provide information on the planned measures to safeguard and protect sensitive data such as personal data (Berez-Kroeker et al., 2022).  \\n\\nMetadata: the term ‘metadata’ refers to structured information about data. Such information makes it easier to understand, discover, use, or manage data. It includes information such as the description of said data, their origin, temporal coverage, geographic location, creator, access conditions, and other descriptive elements (Riley, 2017).  \\n\\nPersonal data: In accordance with GDPR, the term ‘personal data’ refers to any information that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person, such as a name, an identification number, a geographical location, an online identifier, or one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person (European Union, 2016).  \\n\\nClassified data: the term ‘classified data’ refers to data that have been classified to a certain level of sensitivity, considering properties such as availability, integrity, and confidentiality, in order to decide the related level of security and protection measures.  \\n\\n## 4. Roles and Responsibilities in Research Data Management  \\n\\nIn accordance with UT’s RDM policy, ITC identifies the following individual or (groups of) stakeholders and their responsibilities with regard to RDM:  \\n\\nThe Faculty Board is responsible for maintaining good RDM practices as part of the research vision within ITC. Therefore, the Faculty Board is accountable for the implementation of this faculty policy and facilitating that implementation by warranting the availability of infrastructure, tools, and research data management support and expertise, including the presence of a Faculty Data Steward, a Privacy Contact Person, an ICT account manager and an Ethics Committee.  \\n\\nHeads of academic departments are responsible for ensuring that all students in the specializations administered by their departments and all researchers are aware of the Faculty’s policy, and for stimulating them to acquire the necessary information and training to manage research data effectively.  \\n\\nAcademic researchers and students hold the primary responsibility for taking care of the data that they produce. They must warrant proper data management and adhere to the Faculty’s policy.  \\n\\nSupervisors/principal researchers and team leaders are directly responsible for making sure that researchers and students under their supervision are aware of the importance of good data management practices and adhere to the expectations outlined within this faculty policy. More specifically, they must warrant that the research projects under supervision have a DMP in place and that all data underlying the completed research are appropriately documented and preserved as outlined within this policy.  \\n\\n## 5. Faculty Guidelines and Working Rules  \\n\\n### 5.1 Data Management Planning  \\n\\nPlanning data management is essential for every research project and should be an integral part of good research design. Quality research starts with a good DMP. Therefore, for every research project conducted within ITC, a DMP must be written and regularly updated during the project.  \\n\\nMaster students must write a DMP for their research and include it in the documents required for the proposal. The DMP has to be reviewed by the supervisors as part of the proposal’s assessment. PhD candidates must follow a Data Management Bootcamp (1 ECTS) offered by UT to learn how to write a DMP for their PhD projects. The DMP must be written within the first year of their PhD trajectory, reviewed by the Faculty Data Steward, and included in the documents required for the PhD Qualifier. The DMP for a PhD project must be reviewed annually by the supervisors during the annual interview and updated where necessary. Any other research project must have a DMP before the start of the said project, but no later than four months after the start of the research, and it must be reviewed by the Faculty Data Steward. The DMP has to be reviewed regularly and updated where necessary and it must be adhered to by all research team members.  \\n\\nA DMP template is available at UT’s DMP-tool. The template has been accepted by the Dutch Research Council NWO, the independent governmental body Care Research NetherlandsMedical Sciences ZonMW, and the EU (e.g., the European Research Council ERC). Therefore, the UT DMP template should be used unless the funding body or their partners require the use of a different template.  \\n\\nFor support regarding writing a DMP, contact the Faculty Data Steward  \\n\\n### 5.2 Data Storage  \\n\\nEffective research data management is essential for maintaining the accessibility and security of research data. This section outlines the best practices and guidelines for storing data during research. In principle, all research data collected and generated should be stored safely and protected against unauthorised access, accidental disclosure, and loss. The choice of storage facility depends on many factors, such as the type of data, size, the need for collaboration with research partners, etc.  \\n\\nA copy of key research data (key files of the data collected and generated) and the related materials (e.g. documentation, protocols, models, or questionnaires) must be stored in facilities offered by UT, unless exceptions apply.   \\nIn case researchers wish to use their own storage facilities for primary storage, note that UT has strict requirements when it comes to acquisition of research data storage. It is required to ensure that the storage facility is at least ISO 27001-certified and in the case of health data NEN 7510-certified. These two certificates prove that the way data, especially personal and privacy-sensitive data, are stored complies with current security standards. If you need advice regarding the storage certification, please contact the Faculty ICT Account Manager   \\nPortable devices (e.g., external hard drives, USB sticks, or personal laptops) should not be used as the primary storage facility of research data.   \\nNon-digital research data and related materials, such as physical samples, lab notebooks and printed informed consent forms, must be stored in accordance with clearly described procedures and standards within the research group and/or project and must be digitised where possible.  \\n\\nTake a look at the UT storage decision tree which provides an up-to-date overview of UT storage facilities and all other secure storage solutions offered by UT.  \\n\\nContact the Faculty Data Steward in case you have questions or need support.  \\n\\n### 5.3 Data Sharing and Transfer  \\n\\nData sharing refers to providing access to data in a way that maintains the data's availability, accessibility, and confidentiality. This section outlines the best practices and guidelines for data sharing with colleagues within or outside ITC during research.  \\n\\nStored research data should be accessible to at least one other member of the research team other than the main researcher, ideally the principal researcher or a daily supervisor for Postdocs, PhDs, and Master students. Access to the stored data by other research team members is vital to ensure data availability. For collaborative projects involving data sharing, a data sharing agreement, which establishes the terms and conditions under which data are shared and clarifies the roles and responsibilities of both parties regarding the management of the data, should be drawn up in consultation with the Faculty Privacy Contact Person and should be signed by the Faculty Dean prior to sharing research data with external parties.  \\n\\nThe UT storage decision tree also offers a range of facilities for data transfer and data   \\nsharing.   \\nThere are several types of data sharing agreements, depending on the research project and type of data:   \\no A data transfer agreement is generally used when sharing non-personal data with third parties;   \\no A joint controllership agreement is used to establish shared responsibilities regarding the processing of personal data with collaborators. Consortium agreements and Grant Agreements (e.g., Horizon 2020) provide a legal basis for this type of agreement;   \\no A data processing agreement is used when a third party is involved in the processing of personal data on behalf of the data controller (such as collecting, storing, or analysing the data on your behalf);   \\no A non-disclosure agreement is typically used for trade or commercial data, including trade secrets and patent-related data.  \\n\\n### 5.4 Data Documentation  \\n\\nData documentation is crucial to ensure that research data are understandable and re-usable by yourself or by others. In accordance with the FAIR principles,  as a minimum requirement a definite version of research data should be well documented. However, best practice is to start documenting data and record metadata early during the research process and to update these regularly throughout research in order to warrant completeness and accuracy.  \\n\\nResearch data, both digital and non-digital, should always be accompanied by metadata to ensure findability and re-usability. Research data must be accompanied by additional documentation (e.g., in the form of a README file, data paper, etc.) to enable correct interpretation and re-use. Clear, concise language and standard terminologies should be used to ensure comprehensibility.  \\n\\nResearch data must be accompanied by at least one set of metadata for the entire dataset. However, for comprehensive documentation, metadata should be provided for each distinct type of data or file where applicable or necessary.   \\nSince the data repositories provide machine-readable forms of metadata, most often based on a generic metadata standard such as Dublin Core, it is recommended to provide additional documentation in the form of a README file. This documentation should encompass, but not be limited to the data contents and structure, along with all relevant methodological information (e.g., the collection, processing, and quality control aspects of said data), records of different versions of the data files, and details on sharing and access.   \\nDiscipline-specific metadata standards (e.g., the ISO 19115 geographic information metadata standard) can be used to decide on additional information aimed at enhancing the data documentation.   \\nFor the local management of your research datasets and related metadata and for publishing them easily to different research data repositories, you can use the fairly toolset. This toolset includes a command line tool and a JupyterLab extension that facilitate creating, uploading, and downloading research datasets together with metadata without requiring programming skills.  \\n\\n### 5.5 Data Preservation  \\n\\nData preservation refers to the long-time storage of research data to enable the verification and reproduction of research and the re-use of data. Publishing and archiving data are the two most practical ways to preserve data after research.  \\n\\nDigital research data needed for verification and reproduction (at least those underlying all types of academic publications, such as journal articles, reports, theses, etc.) have to be preserved in one of ITC’s approved data repositories or archive facilities for at least ten years after completion of the project (in accordance with The Netherlands Code of Conduct for Academic Practice).   \\nPreserved in a repository, research data can be published publicly, with restricted access, or embargoed. In accordance with the ITC’s Open Science Strategic Plan, the data should be published as open as possible and as closed as necessary, i.e., in case of legitimate reasons, such as ethical reasons, reasons concerning privacy protection and national security reasons, knowledge safety and export control, confidentiality, commercial interest, legal and contractual obligations reasons. However, the metadata must always be made available publicly.   \\nDigital research data that cannot be shared with third parties, including trusted data repositories, must be archived in UT’s archive facility.   \\nResearch data underlying master's and PhD research projects must be preserved before graduation. Research data underlying other types of research projects must be preserved no later than one month after completion of the research project. Non-digital research data, wherever possible and appropriate, should be digitised. If the data is to be preserved in non-digital format, they should be stored securely in accordance with the respective department’s common practices.   \\nThe primary author and co-authors of academic publications share the responsibility of controlling access and making any decision with respect to the data and, therefore, should all be acknowledged in the metadata of the archived or published datasets as contact persons.   \\nFor research projects run by ITC researchers, access to the data with restricted access is controlled by the principal investigator. In situations where the original researchers are not available or no longer affiliated with ITC, access to the data is determined and granted by the department chair.   \\nArchived or published digital and non-digital research data require sufficient documentation to enable proper interpretation and re-use, as described in the section on Data Documentation.  \\n\\nFor publishing research data, UT and ITC recommend two trusted research data repositories: DANS and 4TU.ResearchData.  \\n\\nTrusted repositories are the repositories that have received a Core Trust Seal Certification, which warrants the reliability and durability of data repositories and, hence, the potential for storing data over a long period of time.  \\n\\nFor archiving research data, UT has a certified facility for long-term research data archiving known as AREDA. It is required to contact the Faculty Data Steward before archiving data in AREDA.   \\nFor archiving research data from master research projects, ITC has a separate archive facility.  \\n\\n### 5.6 Data Registration in PURE  \\n\\nThe registration of research output in Pure, including research data, is essential for consolidating information from various sources at one single platform in order to offer a comprehensive overview of ITC research activities and their impact.  \\n\\nAll archived or published digital and non-digital data must be registered in Pure (UT Research Information), where their metadata information is recorded to increase visibility.  \\n\\nStep-by-step guidelines, including a Demo and more guidance on registering research output, are available on the UT Research Information Website  \\n\\n### 5.7 Personal, Confidential, and Classified Research Data Management  \\n\\nWarranting the protection of confidential data, privacy, and the rights of research subjects is paramount in all research activities conducted within ITC. This section outlines key principles, ctices, and compliance measures related to the handling of personal and confidential data in research:  \\n\\nAll research activities involving personal data must adhere to the principles and requirements outlined in the GDPR;   \\nResearchers should only collect the minimum amount of personal data necessary for research purposes. Collecting unnecessary or excessive personal data should be avoided; Researchers and students must report any processing of personal data through GDPR registration using the online UT DMP+GDPR tool;   \\nA Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA), i.e, risk assessment, should be carried out prior to processing any personal data likely to result in high risks to the rights and freedom of data subjects;   \\nPersonal data, confidential and classified data must be protected against unauthorised access and loss as much as possible. More particularly, personal data should be stored in a GDPR-compliant data storage facility and, where needed, additional security measures such as encryption should be applied;   \\nPersonal data should be anonymised or pseudonymised as soon as possible, preferably immediately after collecting those data. Similarly, secondary datasets containing personal data should be pseudonymised or anonymised immediately after receiving them. Note that unlike anonymised data, pseudonymised data are still personal data;   \\nPrior to sharing research data containing personal data, a data processing agreement should be drawn up in consultation with the Faculty Privacy Contact Person and should be signed by the Faculty Dean. A non-disclosure agreement is required in the case of sharing confidential and classified data; see more details under the “Data Sharing and Transferring” section in this policy;   \\nPersonal data needed for verification and reproduction (at least those underlying all types of academic publications, such as journal articles, reports, theses, etc.) have to be preserved in one of ITC’s approved data repositories or archive facilities for at least ten years after completion of the project (in accordance with The Netherlands Code of Conduct for Academic Practice);   \\nInformed consent forms used to collect personal data, either in digital or non-digital form, have to be archived for at least ten years after completion of the research project; Researchers must report any data breaches immediately. Examples of potential data breach include devices containing personal, confidential and classified data being lost or stolen, sharing these data with the unauthorised persons, etc. For more information on data breach, see Cyber Safety at UT;   \\nResearch involving human subjects or potentially sensitive data about or from individuals, groups or organisations must be reviewed by the ITC Ethics Committee before the work commences. For other types of research, it is strongly recommended to identify potential ethical issues related to, for instance, the environment, dual-use aspects, low-income countries, or artificial intelligence, through an ethics review.  \\n\\nMore information on the appropriate use of personal data in research, including a flowchart and practical guidance, can be found on the UT Cyber Safety Website.  \\n\\nThis  pre-DPIA assessment form should be used to find out whether a full DPIA is required.  \\n\\nUT network storage facilities (e.g., P-drive, Unishare,) are ISO 27001-certified, NEN 7510-certified and GDPR-compliant; therefore, they guarantee maximum security for storing and sharing personal data, confidential and classified data during research.  \\n\\nFor personal data stored in non-UT cloud storage (e.g., MS Teams, OneDrive, etc.) or on portable devices (e.g., USB sticks, external hard drives, tablets, etc.), encryption is required.  \\n\\nPersonal data stored on portable devices must be deleted as soon as possible and no later than at the end of the part of research for which the data are needed (e.g., after fieldwork).  \\n\\nThe encryption key must be kept safe and stored in a separate location. Furthermore, it should be shared with at least one other employee in the research group. Generally, this person will be the principal researcher or the chair of the research group.  \\n\\nNon-digital informed consent forms should be digitised where possible. However, UT has an archive service for non-digital informed consent forms. Please contact the Faculty Data Steward for support.  \\n\\nTo submit your application for ethics review, visit the ITC Ethics Committee website or contact the Faculty’s Research Support Officer.  \\n\\nFor support regarding the handling of personal data in research contact the Faculty’s Privacy Contact Person (PCP).  \\n\\n#### References  \\n\\nBerez-Kroeker, A.

(FCT), through the POLEN project5 developed by the FCT National Scientific Computing Unit (FCCN), aims to meet the needs of the scientific community in the area of Research Data Management. It seeks to promote the principles and practice of Open Science, ensuring the sharing and preservation of the research data generated within publicly funded projects.  \\n\\n## Principles  \\n\\n1. Iscte-Instituto Universitário de Lisboa is committed to promoting science and the dissemination of knowledge for the benefit of society, adopting research practices that are open, reproducible, and responsible.   \\n2. It encourages and supports the use of processes and tools that boost collaboration, promoting the dissemination of knowledge and the accessibility and reuse of research results.   \\n3. It enables data and research management in conformity with the FAIR principles,6 ensuring that the research data are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable.   \\n4. It ensures the research data’s availability under open access, with possible duly justified exceptions, in accordance with the principle of as open as possible, as closed as necessary.  \\n\\n## Scope  \\n\\n1. This policy is applicable to all research data generated or managed under research projects and activities pursued on behalf of Iscte-Instituto Universitário de Lisboa. In cases where the research is funded by third parties, any agreement with that third party on rights of access, deposit or storage takes precedence over this policy.  \\n\\n### Requirements  \\n\\nIscte-Instituto Universitário de Lisboa:  \\n\\n1. Requires the deposit, within the Zenodo repository Iscte community,7 of the necessary research data for the validation of the scientific research results produced at Iscte. The data should not only be accompanied by persistent identifiers (for example, Digital Object Identifier (DOI), Open Researcher and Contributor Identification (ORCID ID)), but must also be related to the publications and other outputs whenever possible (through DOI and/or Handle).8   \\n2. Requires that the research data be managed in accordance with the FAIR principles, ensuring that they are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable.   \\n3. Requires the research data’s availability under open access, with possible duly justified exceptions, in accordance with the principle of as open as possible, as closed as necessary. If the access to the data is not open, due to constraints of legal nature, privacy or other, the legitimate reasons justifying the restricted access should be described in the Data Management Plan. In any case, the metadata that ensure the data’s location must be provided.   \\n4. Requires the availability of anonymous or anonymised research data, whenever the envisaged purposes of the research may be achieved in that form or, where it is necessary to make data of personal nature available, their provision in conformity with the General Data Protection Regulation and following the Guidelines for Researchers9 on Personal Data Protection in Scientific Research Activities at Iscte.   \\n5. Requires the submission of the Data Management Plan10 within six months after the project starting date, on the respective Ciência-IUL project page, ensuring that the final version is up-to-date.   \\n6. Requires the research data to be accompanied by all the necessary metadata for its reuse and validation. If applicable, information should be provided on the tools and instruments required for their reuse and validation (and, whenever possible, the actual tools and instruments should be provided).   \\n7. Requires the definition of the rights of use of the research data through assignment of the appropriate licenses – CC BY or CC0 – or equivalent licenses.11   \\n8. Requires the research data’s storage and processing in a secure environment, preferably using the institutional infrastructures,12 in order to prevent losses and unauthorised alterations, ensuring confidentiality whenever necessary.   \\n9. Requires the preservation, for a period of 10 years after the project\\'s completion, after the publication or public presentation of the research work, of the research data required for the validation of the research results or considered of value to the researcher or scientific community. However, the specifications of the funder, publisher, patent, legal requirements or other regulatory requirements should be fulfilled.   \\n10.

Objective  \\n\\nThe Johannes Kepler University (JKU) acknowledges the fundamental significance of managing research data and related records needed to attain high-quality research and scientific integrity. Correct and easily accessible research data form the basis and essential component of any research activity. They also enable the research process or research results to be reviewed and justified, as well as subsequently used. The JKU strives to promote the highest standards in this respect in compliance with the FAIR principles in order to ensure the long-term value of research data for science, research and society. This policy guideline is designed to advise JKU scientists on how they handle research data.  \\n\\n### 2. Scope & period of validity  \\n\\nThis guideline covers the collection, processing, storage and subsequent use of research data. It applies to the entire academic staff of the JKU for an indefinite period. If research activities are promoted or financed or sponsored by a third party and the underlying contract requires specific provisions regarding research data (in particular intellectual property rights, access rights, exploitation rights), the provisions of the specific contract shall take precedence over the provisions of this policy guideline. The same applies to cooperation agreements with external research partners.  \\n\\n### 3. Definition of terms  \\n\\nALCOA+ principle: ALCOA is an acronym that describes the five most important aspects of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) in the handling of clinical research data. These are: Attributable, Legible, Contemporaneous, Original and Accurate. The plus stands for CCEA. This is an extension of the ALCOA principle and stands for Complete, Consistent, Enduring and Available.  \\n\\nData clearing: Data clearing involves checking the permissibility of the transfer of personal data by the JKU to third parties with regard to the latest edition of the data protection act and the basic data Protection ordinance, as well as the protectability of research data, especially in terms of the applicable copyright law. The tasks of data clearing are performed decentrally at the JKU:  \\n\\nThe Legal department is responsible for specific legal matters relating to data protection and copyright, unless these can be fulfilled by one of the following departments.   \\nThe Research service and knowledge transfer department at the JKU is responsible for information and advice on third-party funded projects, research funding and support in the application process.   \\nThe Data protection officer performs their tasks in accordance with article 39 of the GDPR, in particular advising and informing in connection with the processing of personal data and monitoring compliance with the applicable data protection regulations by the JKU and its employees. In addition, pursuant to article 38 (4) of the GDPR, the Data protection officer is a point of contact for data subjects in connection with the processing of their personal data and the exercising of their rights according to the GDPR.   \\nIn addition, JKU researchers are supported by the JKU IPR management department in the field of intellectual property rights (IPR), in particular in connection with patent and licensing matters, and in the drafting of corresponding contracts.   \\nThe Competence Centre for Clinical Studies (KKS Linz) at the Centre for Clinical Research (ZKF) at the medical faculty provides consulting services regarding the processing of personal data in clinical research.  \\n\\nData management plan (DMP): The objective is to describe all activities performed within the context of research activities involving research data throughout their life-cycle by specifying which data are collected, processed and stored for how long and for what purposes, and ensuring that these activities are performed in accordance with the relevant legal (in particular data protection, copyright), contractual and intra-university requirements, in particular the Guideline for safeguarding good scientific practice1, the FAIR principles and ethical principles.2  \\n\\nAustrian privacy law: Federal law regulating the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of their personal data (latest edition of Federal Law Gazette I No. 14/2019).  \\n\\nGDPR: Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council dated 27 April 2016 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, replacing directive 95/46/EC (basic data protection regulation).  \\n\\nThird parties: Natural or legal persons, authorities, institutions or other bodies that are not attributable to the Johannes Kepler University Linz.  \\n\\nFAIR principles: Principles implemented within the framework of research data management to ensure the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability and Re-usability of research data.3  \\n\\nAustrian research organisation law: Federal law concerning general research in accordance with article 89 of the GDPR and research organisation (latest edition of Federal Law Gazette I No. 31/2018).  \\n\\nResearch data: Data resulting from scientific research, experiments, measurements, simulations, surveys or interviews. They include structured mass data as well as unstructured data in a wide range of formats and contents, including process data such as processing steps, algorithms and programs developed during a research project.4 This is all information required to support or validate the history, outcome, observations and findings of research activities (e.g. raw data, processed data, released data, published data).  \\n\\nResearch data management: Process covering the entire life cycle of research data, in particular the planning, acquisition, collection, publication, documentation, provision and storage and archiving of research data.5 Advice and information for researchers in connection with research data management and the preparation of data management plans is provided by staff of the JKU University Library.  \\n\\nResearch documentation (FoDok): Database that stores metadata relating to research performed by JKU employees.  \\n\\nOpen licence: According to article 24 paragraph 1 of Austrian copyright law, the author of a copyrighted work may allow other (natural or legal) persons in the form of a work use licence to use the work for one-off, or all types of exploitation, reserved for the author. Furthermore, the author can also grant others an exclusive (absolute) right to use the work. The transfer of these rights takes place in the form of licenses within the framework of copyright contracts.6 Open licenses (open content) generally allow free or open use, distribution, reproduction and processing of the data as long as the author is named;7 in research, the Creative Commons core licenses (CC BY and CC0) are often used.  \\n\\nAustrian patent law: Patent law 1970, Federal Law Gazette I No. 37/2018.  \\n\\nPersonal data: According to Article 4 No. 1 of the GDPR, personal data is all information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person; an identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier, or one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of the natural person.  \\n\\nRepository: Databases operated by research institutions, in particular universities, for the storage, archiving, management and availability of scientific materials and research data.8  \\n\\nAustrian university law: Federal law on the organisation of universities and their studies (University act 2002 – UG) Federal Law Gazette I No. 3/2019.  \\n\\nAustrian copyright law: Federal law on copyright applying to literary and artistic works and related property rights, Federal Law Gazette I No. 105/2018.  \\n\\n### 4. Rights of use  \\n\\n#### 4.1 General information  \\n\\nThe JKU is entitled to the rights of use of copyrighted works created by people at the university in the course of their university activities, based on the corresponding employment contract regulations. In all other respects, the provisions of article 106 in Austrian university law and Austrian copyright law in their respective valid versions shall apply.  \\n\\nIn accordance with section 106(1) sentence 1 of Austrian university law, scientific members of staff at the university shall be entitled to publish their own academic research work and results; this shall also apply to doctors during medical specialist training in accordance with section 96 of Austrian university law as well as to academic staff working on externally funded projects (project staff).9  \\n\\nIn addition, in accordance with section 106(1) sentence 2 in conjunction with sections 11 and 20 of Austrian copyright law, academic members of staff at the university who have made their own academic contribution to a research project shall have the right to be named as co-authors. Scientific members of staff who independently create copy-righted works are therefore entitled to be named as the sole author.10 If a computer program or a database (section 40f paragraph 3 Austrian copyright law) is created by an employee in fulfilment of tasks for which they are employed, the right to copyright designation according to section 40b Austrian copyright law - unless agreed otherwise - belongs to the employer.11  \\n\\nIn the case of an employee invention in accordance with section 7 paragraph 3 of Austrian patent law, the rectorate must be informed of the invention and the JKU has a right of access to it in accordance with section 106 paragraph 3 Austrian university law. In accordance with section 8 paragraph 1 Austrian patent law, the researcher is entitled to special remuneration for transferring their invention to the employer and for granting right of use with regard to such an invention (cf. SOP 8209). According to Section 20 paragraph 1 Austrian patent law, the inventor is entitled to be named as the inventor.  \\n\\n#### 4.2  Special provisions relating to the Faculty of Medicine  \\n\\nIn the case of employee inventions made by employees of the JKU or Kepler Universitätsklinikum GmbH (KUK) and the JKU, the cooperation agreement between the JKU and KUK stipulates in sections 23.1. and 28.1. that both KUK and the JKU will ensure that inventions made by their employees in the course of their work for the clinical department of the medical faculty are directly or indirectly adopted and, depending on cost bearing capacity, can be utilised for the benefit of KUK or the JKU. The costs of the special remuneration for the invention to be paid by the employer in accordance with Austrian patent law are borne by the contracting parties in proportion to the exploitation revenues they earn.  \\n\\n### 5. Principles of research data management  \\n\\nResearch data are stored and made available in a suitable repository or archiving system and are referenced using persistent identifiers.  \\n\\nWhen depositing data in a repository, researchers are required to declare their affiliation to the JKU in accordance with the provisions of the \"Guideline for the declaration of affiliation for publications and research projects\"12. In order to maintain the integrity of research data, it must be stored correctly, completely, unaltered and reliably, and must be findable, accessible, traceable, interoperable and, where possible, made available for re-use in accordance with FAIR principles. To enable the re-use of research data or research results by citing the original sources, the currently valid citation rules must be applied.  The storage must be dated, and subsequent changes must be stored as separately as possible from the original data. When dealing with clinical research data, it is recommended that the ALCOA+ principle of good clinical practice be applied.  \\n\\nWhenever personal data is handled, it must be in compliance with the applicable data protection regulations. When handling health data, the increased data protection requirements must be met. According to article 2 paragraph 1 of the GDPR in conjunction with article 4 paragraph 1 of Austrian privacy law, the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation and the Austrian privacy law apply to the fully and partially automated processing of personal data. If data are not processed automatically, but manually instead, the GDPR only applies if the data are stored or are to be stored in a structured file system that is organised according to specific criteria, so that access to the personal data it contains is not only possible by sequentially going through the entire collection, but there is a simplified method of indexing and locating its contents.13 Files and collections of files and their cover sheets which are not arranged according to specific criteria - and are therefore unstructured - are not covered by the GDPR; paper files, for example, such as court files in particular, are not covered.14 Also excluded are data obtained purely orally, acoustically or visually, provided they are not to be stored.15  \\n\\nIn the absence of any particular creative achievement (since the implementation and display of results is usually the task of a computer program) - individual data, raw data or results of the mere evaluation or analysis results are in principle not works in accordance with section 1 paragraph 1 of Austrian copyright law and are therefore not protected by copyright, so there is also no provision for licensing.16  \\n\\nHowever, data collections may constitute databases protected by copyright in accordance with section 40f paragraph 1 of Austrian copyright law (database works). But, if the collection of data does not achieve the necessary level of creativity (simple database), it is not protected as a collective work (section 6 Austrian copyright law); in this case ancillary copyright in accordance with section 76c onwards of Austrian copyright law applies if a substantial investment was required for the procurement, verification and presentation of the contents of the database.17 Whether or what kind of protectability applies to research data requires verification in each individual case by the department responsible for data clearing.  \\n\\nProvided that there are no third-party rights, legal obligations, ethical aspects or property regulations to the contrary, research data should be freely licensed and made openly available for re-use, while respecting intellectual property rights.  \\n\\nIn accordance with section 2f paragraph 3 of Austrian research organisation law, the minimum archiving period for research data is 10 years from publication of the research results or completion of the research activity. The administrative documents accompanying the research activities must also be archived. If research data and records are to be (or have to be) erased or destroyed, this may only be performed using a standardised process, taking into account all legal regulations, especially internal university regulations and ethical aspects. Principal investigators or their legal successors must be informed and offered the opportunity for the research data to be handed over. All measures taken must be documented and be accessible for possible later assessment.  \\n\\n### 6. Responsibilities  \\n\\n#### 6.1. Responsibilities of the JKU  \\n\\nThe JKU is committed to creating the conditions for fulfilling this policy guideline by promoting research support practices.  \\n\\nThe JKU is responsible for the following areas:  \\n\\na. The provision of technical assistance, subject to financial constraints, and advice on the collection, documentation, storage, availability, archiving and, where appropriate, destruction of research data and external repositories.   \\nb. The provision of guidelines and directives for the uniform handling of research data, taking into account the principles of research ethics and scientific integrity, etc.   \\nc.

The responsible handling of research data ensures replicability, verifiability and reusability of research results and is thus a fundamental aspect of good scienƟfic pracƟce. Justus Liebig University acknowledges the importance of sustainable research data management and regulates the handling of research data for all members of the university in the following principles, irrespecƟve of data protecƟon requirements and the guidelines for ensuring good scienƟfic pracƟce.  \\n\\n1. Research data refers to all data that are gained in the process of doing research through observaƟon, collecƟon, measurement, experiment, simulaƟon and processing or that are the result thereof. This also includes the documentaƟon and soŌware necessary for the understanding of such data. Depending on scienƟfic discipline and faculty culture, research data can exist in different types, aggregaƟon levels and formats.   \\n2. Research data management includes all handling of research data, ranging from planning the data collecƟon and storage to assuring data quality and processing data to making data available or publishing it. Research data management is oriented towards the current professional standards and takes discipline-specific requirements into account. Handling research data will be documented in a research data management plan at an early stage of a research project and, if necessary, is to be adjusted to the process of the respecƟve project.   \\n3. According to research data management, researchers are required to secure research data safely, appropriately process and document research data, and store research data in the long-term (at least for 10 years). The protecƟon of personal data as well as compliance to copyright and legiƟmate interest of third parƟes must be ensured. The principal invesƟgators of research projects are responsible for guaranteeing these processes.   \\n4. Justus Liebig University recommends you give access to your research data as early as possible using relevant disciplinary or interdisciplinary repositories according to the principles of Open Access. The point in Ɵme and the condiƟons of giving access to research data fall under the responsibility of the researchers.  \\n\\n1 Please note that only the German version of the regulaƟons is official and legally binding.

Introduction  \\n\\nKarlstad University is responsible for ensuring that all research data are reliable and managed in a legal, appropriate and secure manner in conformity with standard research practice. The university advocates the implementation of a clear structure in how data, material and documents are organised through the research process, in order to avoid time-consuming work in connection with archiving, sharing and reusing the vast amount of data generated by research.  \\n\\nKarlstad University takes active measures to ensure that research data and related meta data are findable, accessible and re-usable for further research purposes in accordance with the recommendations of the EU commission1 and the Swedish government.23  \\n\\n## 2. Definitions  \\n\\nAccording to the ethics review act,4 research refers to ”scientific experimental or theoretical work designed to obtain new knowledge and research-based development projects, excluding projects carried out as part of undergraduate or master level studies”.  \\n\\nThe term principal research institution  refers, according to the ethics review act, to ”a public authority or physical or legal body in whose organisation the research is carried out.”  \\n\\nAccording to the National Archives’ general directives on deletion of research-related documents in public authorities,5 a research project is defined as ”a research activity delimited in time and purpose related to a certain assignment and/or certain persons.” A research project can comprise several sub projects and can be externally or internally funded.  \\n\\nIn terms of these guidelines, research data can refer to all forms of stored data collected or created to be analysed for research purposes and on which results and conclusions generated through the research are based. Some examples of research data are statistics and measuring data, transcribed interviews and questionnaire answers, results of experiments, field study observations, audio-video recorded interviews and visual images/art.  \\n\\nThe term meta data refers in these guidelines to a structured description of research data, i.e. “data about data”. Meta data can consist of a descriptive or contextual information on the provenance of data, such as how variables are defined, how data are structured, how various data sets are related, information on  how and by whom the data were collected or if a special software was used to read or analyse the data.  \\n\\nThe term data citation refers, in these guidelines, to the practice of referring to research data in the same way that researchers provide references to journal articles, reports, conference contribution and other publications.  \\n\\n## 3. Foundational principles for research data management  \\n\\nKarlstad University is the principal research institution for the research carried out by staff or affiliated staff at the university. Research data collected by researchers or doctoral students belong as a rule to Karlstad University. This means that the university has ownership6 to research data, and also responsibility for managing research data in a legal, appropriate and secure manner.  \\n\\nAn important principle regarding research data is that it shall be preserved and accessible so that primary material and data analysed can be used without problem to support and verify the methods and results of the research.  \\n\\nAll research projects at Karlstad University shall undergo ethical review and be registered in the university registry, according to the review process decided by the vice-chancellor.  \\n\\n### 3.1 Public documents  \\n\\nKarlstad University is a public authority under the government. This means that research data management must comply with the basic principles applying to all public authorities’ handling of public documents.  \\n\\nResearch data collected outside of Karlstad University become public documents when submitted to the university. Research data created at the university as a rule are to be seen as drawn up public documents when the data are finalised in the research process.7  \\n\\nResearch data shall be stored in an easily accessible way as long as they are deemed valuable for  further research and also be prepared for long-term storage and archiving in accordance with the regulations of the National Archives and the university’s guidelines.  Research data can only be disposed of if there is a rule allowing it. Disposal must follow the local rules on procedures at Karlstad University.  \\n\\n### 3.2 The principle of public access to information  \\n\\nThe principle of public access means that the public and the media have the right to insight into governmental authorities’ operations.  In principle, this means that Swedish as well as foreign citizens have the right to request reading the documents held by Swedish authorities. Generally speaking, this also applies to research data collected or created at Karlstad University.  \\n\\nThe right to request documents is, however, restricted in two ways. First, not all documents held by an authority are public documents; second,  certain information in public documents can be confidential (secrecy marked).  Before research data are provided under the public access principle, a secrecy assessment must be made in each individual case.  \\n\\n### 3.3 Data protection management and ethical review  \\n\\nThe General Data Protection Regulation8 (GDPR), in brief, means that personal data may only be collected for certain justified reasons, that no more data than necessary may be treated, that data may not be stored for longer than necessary, and that treatment should be justified and reasonable in relation to the individual’s basic rights and freedoms. It is also important to ensure that personal data are handled in a secure way and that no more people than those authorised have access to the data.  \\n\\nIf  sensitive personal data (article 9 GDPR) or information of criminal offences (article 10 GDPR) are treated for research purposes, also the rules stipulated in legislation pertaining to ethical review of research on humans must be considered. When these types of personal data are treated, the approval of the Ethical Review Authority is always required. Applicants are first  to be submitted to the local ethics board at Karlstad University.  \\n\\n### 3.4 Information security  \\n\\nInformation security involves protecting information against various forms of threat by adapting the technical, physical and administrative environments in which the information is handled. With regard to the delicacy of information and the risks involved in the handling, Karlstad University has a general responsibility for implementing appropriate technical and organisational protective measures to ensure and be able to demonstrate that the information is handled appropriately and in compliance with current legislation.  \\n\\nResearch data must therefore be handled to ensure that information is protected against unauthorised access (confidentiality), erroneous changes (accuracy), and that the information is accessible when needed  (accessibility). It is also important to make sure that the information cannot be changed, requested by or provided to any unauthorised persons (traceability).  \\n\\nThe two most important measures for achieving appropriate information security for research data is either to classification of information to be treated (i.e. completely insignificant information, sensitive information,  personal data, sensitive personal data or confidential information), or to use the IT resources available for the purpose at Karlstad University. As a rule, research data shall only be handled in the IT systems and cloud services provided by Karlstad University with the appropriate and adapted technical and organisational protection measures.  \\n\\n### 3.5 Research projects with several principal research institutions  \\n\\nKarlstad University is principal research institution and responsible for research data generated by various researchers and research groups at the university.   However, the situation is more complex when it comes to collaboration projects with four principal research institutions. For such projects, agreements regulating the collaboration should as a rule be drawn up, including how research data will be handled in the project.  How to handle research data can also be documented by drawing up a data management plan for the project.  \\n\\nResearch data collected and created at Karlstad University normally belong to the university. If  there are plans to move a research project, or parts of it,  to or from Karlstad University, the  possibilities to transfer, copy or borrow research data should be investigated.9 If research data will be transferred from Karlstad University the National archives must be notified. A researcher who moves from Karlstad University needs to investigate the conditions for transferring data in consultation with Karlstad University and the receiving university before the transfer.  \\n\\n### 3.6 Data management plans  \\n\\nThe process of handling research data continues through the whole life cycle of a research project. The process includes collecting, documenting, processing, storing, sharing, archiving and deleting documents.  Proceeding in a structured way and making data accessible will ensure a future reuse of  the material.  \\n\\nSome funders require a data management plan for the research projects receiving funding. The plan shall describe how the data used in the course of research are collected and/or created will be handled after the project completion. Karlstad University recommends that a plan be drawn up for all projects generating research data, also if not required by the funder.  \\n\\n## 4. Open access to research data  \\n\\nOpen access to research data means that electronic research data and related meta data shall be easily accessible via the internet with as few restrictions as possible. In July 2012, the EU commission recommended the member state to contribute to increased access to research information.  As part of Horizon 2020, further recommendations were issued for open science comprising publications as well as research data. The recommendations were updated in the spring of 2018 and describe how member states should promote sharing research data via national action plans and joint storage solutions, as well as inventive programmes, reward systems and, instruction for researchers.10  \\n\\nIn its research strategic proposition,  \"Knowledge in collaboration: for societal challenges and reinforced competitiveness\" the Swedish government states that  ”research results, such as research data and research publications generated through publicly funded research should be open and accessible as far as possible.  Certain types of data, however, require restricted access to protect personal integrity, national security, for example.  Openness for research with an innovation potential may need to be restricted for reasons of intellectual property rights.  However, it is an important position that open access is the norm and that restrictions in this regard are exceptions\".11  \\n\\nKarlstad University actively works towards promoting open access to research data according to the EU commission\\'s and the government\\'s recommendations.  Research data which are the result of partly or wholly public funding should without charge make data accessible to further research on condition that there is no legal (e.g. secrecy or rules on personal data handling), ethical, technical or commercial reasons. Access to research data shall, at Karlstad University, follow the principle \"as open as possible and as restricted as necessary.\"  \\n\\nCertain types of data, however, may not be made accessible, not even with restrictions. For obvious reasons, it is not, for example, permitted to publish confidential information openly on the internet, which means revealing secrets, which is a crime.  This prohibition also applies to research data containing personal data. There are many occasions on which research data may not be made open and accessible, and an assessment must be made in every individual  \\n\\nResearchers at Karlstad University are responsible for making research data accessible in an appropriate way. There is no requirement that the data should be made accessible before the researchers have published their results. Karlstad University recommends that researchers as a rule make data accessible in an established data repositorium –– completely open or with restrictions based on assessment of appropriateness ––  with data citation requirements.  \\n\\n## 5. FAIR principles  \\n\\nThe FAIR principles12  (F - Findable, A - Accessible, I - Interoperable, R - Reusable) play an important part in efforts towards open science.  They describe some of the most central guidelines for sound data management and open access to electronic research data.  Research data do not need be in digital form originally, but efficient accessibility and FAIR implementation require data in digital form.  The FAIR principles were published for the first time in 2016 and since then the EU and a number of research funders, universities and research infrastructures have endorsed them. In Sweden,  the Research Council and the Royal Library have the government\\'s mandate to develop criteria for assessing the extent to which research data and scholarly publications meet the FAIR principles.13 Altogether, FAIR comprises 15 principles which can be applied to research in all disciplines.  \\n\\nHandling digital research data at Karlstad University should follow the international FAIR principles to the extent it is practicable.  Karlstad University strives to make research data with related meta data findable, accessible and reusable for new research purposes long-term, which generally means several generations of the hard and software required for the processing.  \\n\\nHowever, it is important to note that the FAIR principles do not entail that digital research data should always be open and accessible to everyone. Research ethical assessments, information provided to research participants, personal data protection legislation, and secrecy are factors that always warrant attention before research data can be made accessible beyond the research group, as described under section 5 above.  \\n\\n## 6. Responsibility for research data management  \\n\\nKarlstad University is principal research institution for the research carried out at the university. This means that the university is responsible for ensuring that all research data are reliable and managed in a legal, appropriate and secure manner in conformity with standard research practice.  \\n\\nAs head of the authority, the vice-chancellor has the main responsibility to ensure that operations are carried out according to legislation and efficiently. The vice-chancellor decides on all overarching regulatory documents at Karlstad University.  \\n\\nAt faculty level, the dean is responsible for faculty adherence to current legislation and approved regulatory documents regarding research data management. The dean may delegate the responsibility to department heads.  Heads of departments are responsible for ensuring that departmental research data are archived and disposed of in compliance with the law.  \\n\\nHowever, researchers always have the main responsibility for their research and must comply with standard research practice, current legislation and procedures.  This also applies to sound and appropriate handling of research data.  \\n\\nResearch projects with several researchers from Karlstad University the main responsible researchers should normally be responsible for the research data management. If the main responsible researchers should leave Karlstad University or for some other reason should be unable to perform the task, the responsibility is transferred to the head of department hosting the research project. until a new project leader has been appointed. If research data are transferred to another part of Karlstad University, so is the responsibility for the data.  \\n\\n## 7. Research data management support  \\n\\nAt Karlstad University there is a research data group for issues relating to research data management, data management plans and open access to research data.  \\n\\nThe research data group\\'s duty is to inform about research data issues at the university and to ensure that concerned target groups are updated and have the opportunity to get instruction regularly.  The research data group also has a supportive and consultative function in terms of advice and recommendations on research data management, data management plans and open access to research data.  \\n\\nThe research data group consists of representatives from the central service functions. There is also a reference group with researchers from the faculties. The research data group can be reached at the following address: forskningsdata@kau.se  \\n\\n### 6.

Purpose & Scope  \\n\\nKing’s College London is dedicated to the advancement of knowledge, learning and understanding in the service of society. This policy sets out King’s College London’s requirements for the curation of research data in pursuit of this goal. The policy outlines a framework of support to enable the management of research data so that the benefits of open research data can be realized, subject to compliance with legal, ethical, regulatory, contractual, intellectual property protection and other legitimate requirements.  \\n\\nThe policy applies to all employees, honorary staff and affiliate staff of King’s College London who conduct research and research-related activities, and to postgraduate research students.  \\n\\nIn addition procedure statements 1.2, 1.3 and 1.4 apply to:  \\n\\nundergraduate and postgraduate taught students who have obtained ethical approval for their research projects   \\nsupervisors of those students specified above who are conducting high-risk research as per the university’s research ethics guidance Persons meeting this specification shall be referred to as ‘Researchers’.   \\nThe policy does not apply to King’s Health Partners staff, although they are also encouraged to follow the policy’s principles.  \\n\\nThis policy takes into account the requirements of researchers at King’s College London; evolving policy and practice in scholarly communications; relevant legislation; the ethical conduct of research; and institutional strategies for research and innovation. These are described in more detail in the Research Data Management Procedure.  \\n\\n# II. Principles  \\n\\nResearch data is a valuable resource in its own right. It validates research findings and has long term value as a potential resource for future research and teaching. Good practice in research data management benefits the wider research community and enhances the public value of research by:  \\n\\nenabling the publication, sharing and citation of research datasets   \\nmaximizing the impact of scholarly outputs   \\nenhancing the public visibility of funded research   \\nfacilitating the reuse of data by future researchers   \\navoiding duplication of data collection   \\nreducing the risk of data loss and corruption   \\nreducing the vulnerability of data due to file and software obsolescence   \\nenabling greater scrutiny of published research to affirm the robustness of findings  \\n\\nThis policy adopts the principle of making research data as open as possible, as closed as necessary1, recognizing that there may be legitimate reasons why certain data cannot be published openly. This policy also adopts the FAIR guiding principles, to enable data to be findable, accessible, interoperable and re-usable2.  \\n\\n# III. Definitions  \\n\\nResearch data:  \\n\\nWhile there is no single definition of data, research data can generally be defined as any representation or other objects that are created or gathered for the purposes of producing research or scholarship, and which can be used to validate or reproduce original research findings. The underlying research materials which support research publications can be described as research data. Research data can cover a diversity of form and content, including (but not limited to) numbers, text, images, audio, simulations, models, interview recordings, questionnaires, laboratory notebooks, videos, algorithms, codebooks, test results, specimens, databases or any combination of these. Data objects can be physical or print as well as digital. Research data held within King’s or hosted in external repositories is subject to this policy.  \\n\\nLife cycle:  \\n\\nDifferent elements of this policy apply to the way in which data is managed at different stages of research: during a research project; when research findings are published - either during or after a project; and when the project comes to an end.  \\n\\nDataset: Metadata: Repository: Open data:  \\n\\na set of files containing both research data, and documentation   \\ndata or information about data which describes or contextualizes the data   \\na system for storage and access of research data   \\ndata that anyone can access, use and share  \\n\\n# IV. Policy  \\n\\nThis policy requires that all King’s researchers (with some exceptions), whether externally funded or not, should:  \\n\\nCreate and maintain a data management plan for all projects handling research data   \\nRecord sufficient metadata and documentation about research data during the course of the   \\nresearch   \\nManage research data in compliance with legal, ethical, regulatory, contractual and   \\nIntellectual Property Rights (IPR) requirements throughout its life cycle   \\nRetain IPR in research data where possible and respect IPR contained in third-party data or   \\nthat arising from multi-party collaborations   \\nInclude a data access statement within research publications giving details of how data   \\nsupporting the published results may be accessed   \\nDeposit research data in a repository or archive to ensure long term preservation and   \\nappropriate access   \\nMake research data which supports published research or that which has been retained   \\nfollowing the end of a project openly accessible with as few restrictions as possible unless   \\nthere are compelling legal, ethical, regulatory, contractual or IPR reasons not to   \\nCreate and make publicly available a metadata record describing the data, to enable data   \\ndiscoverability  \\n\\nFurther detail on these requirements is provided in the Research Data Management Procedure.',\n",

In case of a discrepancy between the Swedish original and the English version of the decision, the Swedish original will prevail.  \\n\\n## Guidelines on managing research data  \\n\\nThis regulation has been approved by the President (ref. V-2020-0678) and is valid as of 1 January 2021. The policy document regulates research data management in accordance with international principles of good research practice and in accordance with current legislation for various kinds of data in the field of research. KTH Library is responsible for reviews and questions about the policy document.  \\n\\n### 1 Managing research data  \\n\\nKTH strives to ensure that the results of KTH’s research shall be digitally available and usable for researchers and society. Research data that has been fully or partially financed by public funds and forms the basis of published results must therefore be openly available, to the extent possible with due reference to legal, ethical and possible commercial aspects. KTH supports the internationally adopted FAIR principles to ensure that research data shall be findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable. These principles are compatible with the motto “As open as possible, as closed as necessary”.  \\n\\n#### 1.1 Creating a data management plan  \\n\\nResearchers must create a data management plan at an early stage in the research process in order to facilitate the management of research data.  Such a plan must state who is responsible for data management and for ensuring that management takes place with due consideration to ethical aspects and in accordance with current legislation. The technical solutions and work methods selected must satisfy the requirements of applicable regulations. It must in particular be clarified whether any stage of the research process involves the management of datasets that  \\n\\nare a public document in accordance with the Swedish Freedom of the Press Act   \\n(1949:105) and how this information is to be made available;   \\nare a general document subject to confidentiality in accordance with the Swedish Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act (2009:400) and that management takes place to ensure that confidentiality is not prejudiced;   \\nare security-protected and that in such cases management takes place in accordance with security protection legislation;   \\nare collected in such a way that an ethical review needs to take place in accordance with the current Swedish Ethical Review Act (2003:460);   \\ncontain personal data and that in such cases processing takes place in accordance with data protection legislation and that processing is recorded in KTH’s personal data processing register;  \\n\\nhave a future research value and should be preserved in the long term in accordance with the Swedish National Archives’ regulations (RA-FS 1999:1).  \\n\\nThe regulatory framework for research data management with regard to preservation is described in KTH’s information management plan. The data management plan shall be designed on the basis of this.  \\n\\nThe data management plan can be revised continuously throughout the research process.  \\n\\n#### 1.2 Research data management in collaborations  \\n\\nWhen research takes place in collaboration with other actors, data management must be clarified in, or in connection with, the research collaboration agreement that should be concluded between the parties. This must specify who is responsible, whether there are any reasons for confidentiality and, in cases where intellectual property values arise, who has the access rights and ownership rights. If there is processing of personal data, responsibility for this must be clearly specified.  \\n\\nKTH strives to ensure that exclusive ownership rights to publish and reuse research data are not assigned to other actors, and that KTH retains access rights to use research data in future research and education.  \\n\\n#### 1.3 Publication of research data  \\n\\nAs a basic principle, research data that forms the basis of published research results should be made publicly available and be findable in such a way that data can be reused. When publishing research data or metadata about research data, KTH Royal Institute of Technology should be given as affiliation in the same way as for any other publication (see also Guidelines on Scientific Publications). It is also appropriate for the dataset to be assigned a persistent identifier and for there to be an opportunity for versioning when data is made available in connection with publication.  \\n\\nMetadata must state clearly what conditions apply for access and reproduction of the dataset. If there are legal, ethical or commercial obstacles to complete digital availability, it is recommended that metadata be published describing the dataset including the conditions for access. If the publication of metadata is also considered inappropriate with regard to the protection of critical infrastructure or with regard to Sweden’s national security or information security in general, publication must be avoided.  \\n\\n### 2 Responsibility for research data management  \\n\\nKTH has ultimate responsibility for  \\n\\nensuring that the necessary digital infrastructure and appropriate services for good research data management are available; ensuring that KTH’s researchers can obtain advice and guidance on matters concerning the management, documentation, storage, preservation and sharing of research data.  \\n\\nA person responsible for research data management should be appointed in the relevant data management plan. The person who is responsible for research data management should be sufficiently knowledgeable in the field of research to be able to make sure that the documentation of research data that is managed in the research process takes place in accordance with good research practice. If no responsible person has been appointed in the data management plan, the researcher responsible for the project is also the responsible for research data management. If the responsible person ceases to be employed at KTH, the head of school or the person delegated by the head of school assumes responsibility until a new person responsible for research data management is appointed.  \\n\\nThe person who is appointed is responsible for managing research data in accordance with good research practice, current legislation, commitments to research funding bodies and KTH’s policy document; drawing up necessary and adequate documentation of research data; ensuring that research data is made available in connection with publication with sufficient documentation to be findable and reusable.',\n",
       " '# Research Data Policy  \\n\\n## Background  \\n\\n1. Management of data is an essential part of good research practice and all researchers in the University have an obligation to record, store and archive their data appropriately.  This brings with it the assurance that data supporting publications are available for analysis and will enable access by other researchers who could use the data, thus maximising the effectiveness of our research funding. The precise requirements of this and the procedures that should be used is a very complex issue when considering the wide range of information generated in research.  Thus the primary responsibility for research data management lies with individual researchers, and it is these staff who need to consider each individual project, whether it is appropriate to archive data and exactly what data should be stored.  However, this policy sets out our expectations, support and processes that are aimed at ensuring that research data from Lancaster is managed in the best possible way.  \\n\\nIT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THIS IS A RAPIDLY EVOLVING ENDEAVOUR SO THAT THE UNIVERSITY WILL BE CONTINUALLY AIMING TO DEVELOP THESE GUIDELINES.  \\n\\n### What should researchers do?  \\n\\n2. Researchers at Lancaster University will identify which projects are appropriate and which data are to be archived.  In this context they will then manage their data in such a way that they:  \\n\\nensure research data and records are accurate, complete, authentic and reliable;   \\nmeet funding body grant requirements;   \\nensure that confidentiality and anonymisation requirements are achieved;   \\ncomply with the Data Protection Act and Freedom of Information legislation;   \\nmaximise research efficiency by enabling others to use the data;   \\nminimise the risk of data loss (e.g. by data backup).  \\n\\n3. More specifically, Lancaster University expects that:  \\n\\n(I) all research will be carried out according to the principles laid out in the University Research Ethics Code of Practice;   \\n(II) primary responsibility for research data management during any research project or programme lies with the principal investigator;   \\n(III) the principal investigator will be responsible for clarifying responsibilities where data ownership may be ambiguous (e.g. in a multi-partner collaboration).  If a PI leaves Lancaster their Head of Department should ensure that appropriate provision has been made for data access;   \\n(IV) every member of a research team should be familiar with the data requirements of the organisation funding their research and of this University policy;   \\n(V) each project will have a data management plan that is produced at funding application stage or at the beginning of the project.  Note that some funders will have more rigorous conditions than those described here;   \\n(VI) as a minimum, research data directly associated with publications should be archived;   \\n(VII) all research data to be archived must be associated with metadata which meets minimum standards set out in guidelines given on RSO website.  The metadata should be sufficient to enable other researchers to understand how it was created or acquired, and, if it is to be made openly available, to discover it and assess its reuse potential;   \\n(VIII) all research data will be stored in either electronic or paper form for a minimum of 10 years after the end of a project, unless ethical considerations, participant confidentiality, FOI requirements or external agencies e.g. NHS, specifically require otherwise;   \\n(IX) research data will be submitted to national or international data services and repositories where available or required by either funders or publishers and this will replace the need for local archiving;   \\n(X) exclusive rights to reuse or publish research data should not be handed over to commercial publishers or agents without retaining the rights to make the data openly available for re-use, unless this is a condition of the funding.  \\n\\n### What will the University do?  \\n\\n4. In order to support researchers and satisfy the requirements of the funders the University will:  \\n\\n4.1 store research processes/governance information and research management documentation in accordance with the Record Retention and Disposal Schedule Guidance.  The Research Support Office will store the following information in accordance with the Schedule and funders’ requirements: funders’ award letters, contracts and collaboration agreements, financial statements, claims and their relevant evidential documentation, audit certificates and ethical approval documentation;  \\n\\n4.2 aim to provide mechanisms whereby research data that may be useful for other researchers but is not suitable for national repositories, can be archived appropriately.  The University will not provide central storage for physical items such as notebooks, artefacts etc. Individual researchers will be responsible for this;  \\n\\n4.3 provide guidance and training where necessary, through our web site and Research Support Office, on the following:  \\n\\n(a) access to external repositories;   \\n(b) access to information on requirements of funders;   \\n(c) appropriate formats for data storage;   \\n(d) appropriate meta data for stored data;   \\n(e) decisions on what data to store;   \\n(f) the production of data management plans;   \\n4.4 establish a review group, chaired by the Pro-Vice-Chancellor (Research and Enterprise), that will act as a point of advice and reference on decisions over the nature of data that needs to be archived;   \\n4.5 review annually, through the University Research Committee, this policy and the progress of the implementation plan;   \\n4.6 consider collaborative approaches to data storage with other Universities.  \\n\\n## Supporting resources  \\n\\n5. Guidance on how to store data and the current requirements of major funders can be found at the Research Support Office Website.  \\n\\n## Definitions  \\n\\nResearch:  The HEFCE definition of research in relation to the REF is:  ‘Research’ is understood as original investigation undertaken in order to gain knowledge and understanding.  It includes work of direct relevance to the needs of commerce, industry, and to the public and voluntary sectors; scholarship [\\\\*]; the invention and generation of ideas, images, performances, artefacts including design, where these lead to new or substantially improved insights; and the use of existing knowledge in experimental development to produce new or substantially improved materials, devices, products and processes, including design and construction.  It excludes routine testing and routine analysis of materials, components and processes such as for the maintenance of national standards, as distinct from the development of new analytical techniques.  It also excludes the development of teaching materials that do not embody original research.  \\n\\nResearch Data:   This is not easy to define in a comprehensive way it is therefore important for each researcher to consider this in detail in the context of their own project.  To give a broad view the University of Melbourne uses the following definition:  “Research Data are facts, observations or experiences on which an argument, theory or test is based.  Data may be numerical, descriptive or visual.  Data may be raw or analysed, experimental or observational.  Data includes:  laboratory notebooks; field notebooks; primary research data (including research data in hardcopy or in computer readable form); questionnaires; audiotapes; videotapes; models; photographs; films; test responses.  Research collections may include slides; artefacts; specimens; samples.  Provenance information about the data might also be included: the how, when, where it was collected and with what (for example, instrument).  The software code used to generate, annotate or analyse the data may also be included”.  \\n\\nResearcher:  In this context a researcher is a member of staff or student of Lancaster University who is performing research in the name of the University.  \\n\\n### Funders policies  \\n\\nMany funders now require that data management and sharing plans form part of the research application.  The Digital Curation Centre (DCC) has summarised the requirements of UK funders and also provides full details of funders’ data policies.

It will ensure that research data is managed to high standards throughout the research data lifecycle.  \\n\\nThe effective management of Research Data will help us to:  \\n\\nmeet the requirements of our funders   \\nrecognise the value and impact of our research data, to ourselves and others   \\nimprove the visibility of and our reputation for research and create opportunities for further research collaboration   \\nencourage open enquiry and allow results to be independently tested, improving the overall quality of research.  \\n\\n## Definition of Research Data  \\n\\nResearch data means information in digital, computer-readable format or paper based that:  \\n\\nis contained or presented in various ways including notes, facts, figures, tables, images (still and moving), audio or visual recordings; and   \\nwhich is collected, generated or obtained during the course of or as a result of undertaking research (which includes but is not limited to   \\nconducting field or laboratory experiments, conducting trials, surveys, interviews, focus groups or analysis of data); and   \\nwhich is subsequently used by the researcher as a basis for making calculations or drawing conclusions to develop, support or revise theories, practices and findings.  \\n\\nThis policy encompasses data from research that has the potential for publication, regardless of whether or not the research is funded. It applies to research carried out by academic staff and Postgraduate Researchers, but is unlikely to apply to Undergraduate research except in exceptional circumstances.  \\n\\n# Policy  \\n\\n1. Research data will be managed in accordance with funder, legislative and ethical requirements throughout the research data lifecycle.   \\n2. Use of others’ data should always conform to legal, ethical and regulatory frameworks including appropriate acknowledgement.   \\n3. Responsibility for research data management during any research project or programme lies with responsible owners such as Principal Investigators (PIs   \\n4. A Data Management Plan that explicitly addresses the capture, managemen integrity, accessibility, usability, confidentiality, preservation, sharing and publication of research data must be created for each proposed research project or funding application at the outset. Sufficient metadata shall also be created and stored to aid discovery and re-use. Data management plans should take account of and ensure compliance with relevant legislative frameworks which may limit public access to the data (for example, in the areas of data protection, intellectual property and human rights).   \\n5. If there are sound reasons why the openness of research data may need to be restricted (eg to protect commercial interests, protect individual confidentiality and privacy, avoid security risks, protect sensitive sites, etc), then justification for this must be included in the Data Management Plan.   \\n6. The University will provide mechanisms and services for storage, backup, registration, deposit and retention of research data assets in support of current and future access, during and after completion of research projects.   \\n7. Where possible, researchers should seek to recover the direct costs of managing research data generated by projects from the research funder.   \\n8. All research data should be offered for deposit and preservation in the University’s PURE Research Information System in a citable form, unless specified otherwise in the Data Management Plan.   \\n9. Data should not be deposited with any organisation that does not commit to its access and availability for re-use. Exclusive rights to reuse or publish research data should not be handed over to commercial publishers without retaining the rights to make the data openly available, unless this is a condition of funding.   \\n10. At the completion of each research project, the PI should ensure that all relevant research data are made available, subject to meeting appropriate requirements, in the location specified in the data management plan.   \\n11. Research and Knowledge Exchange Committee will be responsible for reviewing and updating this policy.  \\n\\n## Further Advice and Guidance  \\n\\nRCUK Draft Concordat on Open Research Data    \\n\\nDepartment: Research  \\n\\nRCUK Common Principles on Data Policy:    \\n\\nDigital Curation Centre    \\n\\nDCC tool for Data Management Planning    \\n\\nUniversity of Edinburgh Research Data Management Guidance',\n",
       " \"# Guidelines for Handling Research Data at Leibniz University Hannover  \\n\\n## PREAMBLE  \\n\\nLeibniz University Hannover recognises the importance of research data in the process of scientific research.  \\n\\nThese guidelines and the principles outlined in them are based in particular on the Alliance of German Science Organisations’ “Principles for the Handling of Research Data”1 and on the German Research Foundation’s (DFG) “Guidelines on the Handling of Research Data”.2  \\n\\nThe reliable and responsible handling of research data is indispensable for the traceability of research and the dissemination of scientific findings. The production, processing, documentation, safeguarding, preservation and sustainable provision of research data should therefore take place in accordance with the recognised standards for each discipline and be based on the FAIR data principles.3 This guarantees that data and metadata are findable, accessible, interoperable and re-usable. At the same time, legal and ethical requirements, as well as the characteristics of and differences between scientific disciplines, should be observed.  \\n\\nLUH encourages the development of proper recognition for its researchers, who provide access to their high-quality research data in recognised repositories and archives in accordance with the FAIR principles.  \\n\\n## DEFINITION OF RESEARCH DATA AT LEIBNIZ UNIVERSITY HANNOVER  \\n\\nResearch data refers to all data that is collected and processed during the scientific research process. It forms the basis for scientific research findings. Depending on the scientific discipline, this can include very different types of data. Leibniz University Hannover adopts the DFG's definition of research data, which includes, among others, the following types of data: “measurement data, laboratory results, audiovisual information, texts, survey data, objects from collections, or samples […]. Methodical forms of testing such as questionnaires, software and simulations may also […] be categorised as research data.”4  \\n\\nResearch-data management ensures the accessibility, re-use, reproducibility and quality of research findings. It includes both the planning and the implementation of a process for the handling of research data. The cross-linking of research data with metadata throughout the research process ensures that data can be easily located and reused. An overview of subject-specific and cross-disciplinary metadata schemas is available in the RDA Metadata Directory.5  \\n\\n### PRINCIPLES  \\n\\n1. Research project heads and independent researchers are obligated to observe the principles of good scientific practice in order to prevent data loss, prepare research data for sustainable use, and document and archive this data.6 They are responsible for data management for their research activities and projects and for the integrity of the data collected.   \\n2. Leibniz University Hannover requests that its researchers store, archive and publish research data in subject-specific repositories or in the university's existing institutional infrastructure – provided that this complies with legal and ethical requirements. This ensures that research data is freely accessible to the public, in accordance with the Leibniz University Hannover Open Access Policy.7, 8 At a minimum, research data should be freely available for scientific use, and to ensure reusability it should be assigned an open licence.9 The citation should likewise be assigned a persistent identifier, e.g. DOI (digital object identifier). Leibniz University Hannover recommends that its researchers use CC0 or CC BY licences to enable the extensive reuse of their work. This is in accordance with the requirements of the funding bodies as well as the FAIR data principles.   \\n3. Leibniz University Hannover advises its researchers to develop internal institute and/or project guidelines which establish detailed rules for handling research data. Researchers should also systematically draft and implement data management plans within the scope of project planning.  \\n\\n4. Leibniz University Hannover recommends that its faculties and research schools integrate the subject-specific handling of research data into their teaching.  \\n\\n### SUPPORTING THE IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS  \\n\\nLeibniz University Hannover supports its researchers throughout the entire research-data management process, from project planning to publication, with an advising and training programme. It also provides an institutional data repository.10 The advisory and training offers also cover issues related to ethical and legal requirements. This service combines the expertise of the TIB – Leibniz Information Centre for Science and Technology, the Leibniz University IT Services, and the Research and Innovation Services department. Up-to-date information about research-data management at Leibniz University Hannover is available on the university's research-data management website: www.fdm.uni-hannover.de/en  \\n\\nThis version of the guidelines was approved by the Presidential Board and the Senate on 15 July 2020.   \\n\\n\\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Versionnumber</td><td>3.0</td></tr><tr><td>Dateoflastrevision</td><td>June 2020 (weblinks checked June 2024)</td></tr><tr><td>Revisedbythe</td><td>ResearchDataSupportTeam</td></tr></table></body></html>\\n\\nInformation about this version of the guidelines\",\n",
       " '# Research Data Management Regulations Leiden University  \\n\\nFocal points and explanations of the various articles appear in italic.  \\n\\n## A. Definitions and basis  \\n\\n1. These regulations are intended as a framework for a University research data management policy and require further elaboration at disciplinary level. Each Faculty Board must decide how the regulations will be further elaborated upon within the faculty and which role the institutes will play.  \\n\\n2. Research data is understood to mean the following: all data that is gathered and generated during academic research. This also includes the data that is acquired by processing and analysing (raw) research data. We follow NWO here, which states, ‘we understand “data” to mean both gathered, unprocessed data and analysed, generated data.’ This does not mean that all data must also be preserved. The decision concerning which data to preserve is recorded at the disciplinary level (see article 16).  \\n\\n3. These regulations apply to all digital and non-digital research data.  \\n\\nWe follow NWO policy here. Non-digital data can mean, for instance, preserved bio-material, audio recordings, paper questionnaires and paper lab journals. NB: this stipulation does not mean that all non-digital data must be digitised per se, but it does mean that the same requirements apply to non-digital data concerning findability, reusability, long-term preservation, etc.  \\n\\n### Before the research  \\n\\n4. A data management plan (DMP) must be drawn up before data collection for a research project begins. The DMP elaborates upon the data management policy of the faculty/institute for the specific research project in question.  \\n\\n### During the research  \\n\\n5. During the research, research data must be securely preserved. This means that the integrity, availability and – if required – confidentiality of the data must be guaranteed. Please note: once the research has been completed, the research data must be preserved for the long term together with the metadata, software and other documentation required for reuse (Article 7). This must also be borne in mind during the research, for instance because it will generally be impossible to provide satisfactory metadata for all the data once the research has been completed.  \\n\\n### After the research  \\n\\n6. Research data must be managed in such a way that, at the latest, - at the point in time of the last publication arising from the research, or at the point in time of the formal completion of the research project it is preserved so that it is at least findable, accessible, comprehensible and reusable in the long term.  \\n\\nTwo instances are mentioned here because not all research culminates in a publication. However, it   \\nis then also important that the research data is preserved and is findable. Externally funded   \\nresearch projects will generally formally conclude upon their financial-administrative completion. n explanation of the criteria that are used: Findable The data must be findable for other researchers and involved parties. Its findability improves if it is deposited in a (discipline-specific) data archive or repository. The information about the data (metadata) is then registered in a standardised manner and is findable, also for search engines. Future findability is guaranteed by assigning a persistent identifier to the data. A commonly used identifier for data is DOI (digital object identifier). A DOI is assigned by a data archive or data publisher and is a unique number for a digital object, in this case a dataset. The DOI remains the same even if the location of the dataset (URL) changes. A DOI or other persistent identifier is used in citations or references to the dataset. Accessible: Data accessibility does not necessarily mean that the data must immediately be made fully open. The data will have to be made accessible in some instances, for example for verification by a grant provider or journal, but will remain inaccessible to the wider public. With sensitive data, full publication will never be an option. Research data can be retained under embargo; then only those who have deposited the data have access to it. The duration of the embargo is determined in consultation with the data archive. A further option is only to grant access if a request for access is submitted to the researcher. The researcher then knows who is consulting the data and can reach agreements about its use and reuse. NB: if the decision is made to limit access to the data, it is essential that the metadata (description of the data) is findable. Comprehensible Metadata and any supplementary documentation must describe the data in such a way that other researchers will also be able to understand and use it. Reusable This criterion is further elaborated upon in Article 7. Long-term retention This criterion is further elaborated upon in Article 8. Research data must be stored together with the metadata, other documentation and   \\npossibly the software and version of the software required for its potential reuse.  \\n\\nResearch data must be stored in such a way that it is independent of the underlying equipment/hardware, such as microscopes, scanners or recording equipment. Long-term data formats that are supported by data archives should be used if possible. Retention of hardware can be considered in certain cases, for instance in the case of software that is only compatible with an obsolete computer operating system. Close attention must be paid to the cost/benefit ratio here. 8. Once the research has been completed, the research data must be retained securely for the long term. This means that the integrity, availability and – if required – confidentiality of the data must be guaranteed. The data should be retained according to international guidelines. For digital data this can be achieved by preserving it in a Trusted Digital Repository (an online depot). Non-digital research data must be preserved according to the prevailing standards in the discipline.  \\n\\nA Trusted Digital Repository possesses equipment, hardware and software for the long term and reliable retention of digital information. This facility must be embedded in a reliable organisation that has a long-term mission and funding. There are three prevailing international standards for Trusted Digital Repositories and the manner in which they retain digital data for the long term. In ascending order of reliability requirements these are: the Data Seal of Approval1, the Nestor Seal2 (also known as DIN 31644) and the RAC standards3 (also known as ISO 16363). Data preservation at a repository with a Data Seal of Approval (the lowest category) currently suffices for NWO and Horizon 2020. It is recommended to digitise non-digital data as far as possible for long-term retention.  \\n\\n9. The minimum retention term for research data is ten years.  \\n\\nHere we follow The Netherlands Code of Conduct for Scientific Practice of the VSNU (2014 version).  \\n\\n## B. Responsibilities  \\n\\n10. The Faculty Board is responsible for the further elaboration of these regulations and determines the level at which this takes place: at faculty and/or institute level. These regulations are a framework within which the faculty can determine its own policy. This will be sometimes only at faculty and sometimes only at institute level; sometimes a combination of both will be the most appropriate. With regard to the latter, this could mean general faculty regulations that have a specific appendix for each institute.  \\n\\n11. The academic director of the institute is responsible for the correct implementation of the policy. The DMPs for the research projects in the institute describe how the policy is implemented in practice (see below).  \\n\\n12. The DMP for a research project must record which data-management responsibilities are assigned to the various members of staff who are working on the project.  \\n\\nMany research projects involve several researchers, for instance PhD candidates, postdocs and members of the permanent staff. The DMP records which responsibilities have been assigned to whom. Projects in which researchers from multiple institutes and/or external parties are involved require special attention. It is also important to record what will happen to the data and the responsibility for it if one of the researchers leaves.  \\n\\n13. All DMPs must be stored centrally within the faculty or institute for at least 20 years.  \\n\\nPlease note: if a DMP is destroyed, the researcher or institute can no longer demonstrate how certain decisions concerning the destruction of data were made (with regard to academic integrity). The retention term is longer for a DMP than for the data, because the DMP can then be used in any instances that arise to demonstrate that the destruction of a certain dataset (for instance after the standard ten years) was in line with the DMP.  \\n\\n14. A data protection officer is appointed at university level who is responsible for adherence to the policy with regard to the security of research data.  \\n\\nIf research proposals are being granted funding within the Horizon 2020 framework, the data protection officer may be asked to provide a statement to the effect that the ‘technical data protection procedures’ will be adhered to within the project. The data protection officer is thus responsible for the protection of the research data during the project.  \\n\\n15. The Executive Board is responsible for providing the facilities and support that make reliable data management possible.  \\n\\nThis does not mean that all facilities and support must necessarily be offered within the University; if required and beneficial, agreements can be reached with national or international parties who offer facilities and/or support in the field of data management.  \\n\\n## C. Elaboration  \\n\\n16. In the elaboration of these University regulations, the following aspects at least must be addressed. Derogations from these regulations must be recorded and well-motivated. The elaboration of the regulations should correspond with the standards that currently prevail in the discipline. How data-management responsibilities are assigned within the institute; Which data needs to be retained, given the type of research conducted in the institute; What the policy is concerning data arising from bachelor’s, master’s and research master’s programmes (and theses in particular); How the requirement that the integrity, availability and confidentiality of the data must be guaranteed will be met during the research; How, once the research has been completed, the requirement will be met that at the time of the research’s publication the data must be retained in such a way that it remains findable, accessible, comprehensible and reusable in the long term. A possible maximum retention term for data and DMPs.  \\n\\n### 17. The following aspects at least must be covered in the DMP for a research project:  \\n\\nHow data-management responsibilities are assigned within the project and what will happen if the researcher, or one of the researchers, leaves;   \\nThe types of data that will be generated and collected (with format and scope);   \\nThe collection method(s) or origin of the data (including hardware and software);   \\nThe standards and metadata for the documentation of the data (discipline-focused and/or in line with standards set by the repository where the data is preserved);   \\nWhere the data will be preserved during the research and how security and access will be arranged;   \\nThe measures that will be taken for the long-time preservation of and access to the data; Who will have access to the data at which point;   \\nHow sensitive or otherwise confidential data is dealt with.   \\nResearchers can use the templates that grant providers such as NWO and the European   \\nCommission use to draw up a DMP. The University has also created such a template. In the DMP,  \\n\\nresearchers can in part refer to or draw upon the data management policy of their faculty or institute.  \\n\\n18. All the above articles have an implementation term of three years from the time of establishment, with the exception of the appointment of the data protection officer. The proposed policy has such an impact that it is not realistic to make it compulsory within the short term. Opting for an extended implementation period means that faculties and institutes each have the opportunity to apply their own phasing-in plan. This does not alter the fact that in particular researchers who wish to submit grant proposals will probably already need to follow the greater part of this policy in the short term.  \\n\\n19. These regulations do not have retroactive effect.  \\n\\nIn principle, data collected in research projects that have already been completed therefore does not fall under the regulations. There is a grey area here if a new project builds upon previously collected data; it will be necessary to examine on a case-by-case basis whether it is possible to preserve the old data for the long term.  \\n\\n20. If there is due cause, these regulations will be revised by the Executive Board during the implementation phase above. At least the Research Council, the ICT and Research Steering Group and the Information Managers Platform must be consulted for such a revision.  \\n\\nThe Research Data Management Regulations were established by the Executive Board on 19 April 2016.',\n",

This includes, but is not limited to, employed and honorary staff, research students and visiting academics. It is expected that all collaborative research partners should be made aware of this policy. The group to whom the policy applies are referred to collectively in this document as ‘Researchers’.  \\n\\n1.2 LSHTM expects the principles set out in this policy to be understood, observed, and followed by all researchers.  \\n\\n1.3 Where research is undertaken as part of a research project, primary responsibility for ensuring compliance rests with the senior researcher, typically the Principal Investigator (PI) or Supervisor. Responsibility may be delegated to a named researcher as necessary.  \\n\\n1.4 Where research is conducted with other institutions and/or external researchers, LSHTM researchers are responsible for the management of research data that are under their own control. If the senior researcher is not a member of LSHTM, LSHTM researchers should make their collaborators aware of the policy to facilitate compliance.  \\n\\n1.5 If all researchers associated with the research have left LSHTM, responsibility for compliance will devolve upwards, resting with the Head of Department in the first instance.  \\n\\n1.6 Exemption to specific principles may be granted in circumstances where compliance will breach legislative, regulatory, contractual, ethical, and/or other obligations. Such cases should be discussed with the Research Data Manager within Library, Archive & Open Research Services (LAORS) in the first instance. The decision will be escalated to the Research Governance Committee in more complex cases.  \\n\\n## 2 PURPOSE AND OVERVIEW  \\n\\n2.1 The London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) recognises research data as a valuable asset that forms the basis for rigorous scientific enquiry, serves as evidence of research conduct, and has the potential to support equitable partnerships and enable new and innovative research in public health.  \\n\\n2.2 This Research Data Management Policy (henceforth RDM Policy) sets out expectations for how researchers should manage and share research data under their control in accordance with good research practice.  \\n\\n2.3 The RDM Policy forms a component of LSHTM’s over-arching research governance framework, which regulates the research undertaken at LSHTM. It should be read in conjunction with institutional, national, international, and other requirements that apply to research data. This includes, but is not limited to, ethical and legal conditions that apply to the handling of human data.  \\n\\n2.4 The RDM Policy establishes LSHTM’s commitment to complying with the Concordat on Open Research Data, a framework for best practice within UK HEIs with respect to research data management. It forms a component of LSHTM’s research governance framework and should be read in conjunction with the policies and procedures outlined in the References section.  \\n\\n## 3 POLICY  \\n\\nThe London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) defines the following principles to be followed by researchers in order to ensure research data are managed and disseminated in accordance with good research practice.  \\n\\nGuidance on addressing the principles can be found on ServiceDesk   \\n(  and the intranet (  One-to-one support is available from the Research Data Manager within the Library, Archive & Open Research Services.  \\n\\n### 3.1. LSHTM-led research projects working with research data must create a Data Management Plan  \\n\\nA Data Management Plan (DMP) is a formal document that outlines how research assets, such as data, code, and other support material, will be obtained, managed and shared during the research lifecycle and following its completion. It outlines how the researcher will address requirements that apply to the research and steps that will be taken to ensure it can be verified and reused.  \\n\\nLSHTM-led research projects working with research data must prepare a Data Management Plan (DMP) before the commencement of research, even if not required by their research funder.  \\n\\nA Data Management Plan should be written at the appropriate stage:  \\n\\nPublic/private funded research should prepare a Data Management Plan prior to submission of a research application or within the first 3 months of project funding, as required by the funder.   \\nPhD/DrPH students should agree a Data Management Plan with their Supervisor and submit it as part of their Upgrading or Review Report.   \\nResearchers that are unfunded, working with 3rd party data only, performing consultancy, undertaking an MSc project solely in pursuit of a qualification are encouraged to prepare Data Management Plan, but are not covered by this mandate.  \\n\\nIt is advisable to develop a Data Management Plan in conjunction with other relevant documents, such as the research plan/protocol and Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA), where appropriate.  \\n\\nAll researchers associated with a research project must be made aware of and abide by the Data Management Plan.  \\n\\nThe Data Management Plan should be reviewed and updated at appropriate stages during the research lifecycle. It is recommended that it is reviewed and updated when significant changes are made to the project work plan or every six months, as a minimum.  \\n\\nFunder-specific templates and guidance for writing a Data Management Plan should be followed, where applicable. If no funder template exists, LSHTM provides templates that may be used (see Related Policies & Procedures).  \\n\\n### 3.2. Data management costs should be recovered from the research funder, where permitted  \\n\\nCosts associated with the capture, management, archiving, and sharing of research data during the project lifetime and following its completion should be considered at the earliest opportunity, preferably when preparing the research application, so that suitable arrangements can be made.  \\n\\nResearchers should review research funder guidelines on allowed costs and, where permitted, write these into the justification of resources and budget of the research application. Common examples of data management costs include hardware and software purchases, data-related training, staff time for data preparation, and use of third-party services.  \\n\\nAdvice on research data costs may be obtained from the Research Data Manager.  \\n\\n### 3.3. Data rights should be recognised and agreed at the earliest opportunity  \\n\\nResearchers should clarify intellectual property rights and custodianship for research data and other research assets that are used in research at the earliest opportunity. This will ensure that it can be collected, stored, managed and shared in compliance with relevant conditions that apply to research. This includes ethical, legal, regulatory, contractual, and/or other requirements.  \\n\\nThe rights of research participants to engage with decision-making is recognized as important for ensuring they benefit from work undertaken, in line with guidelines such as the CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance. Research participants must be provided with sufficient information to understand and influence how their information will be stored, analysed and shared as part of the research process. Guidance may be found in the LSHTM Standard Operating Procedure on Informed Consent (LSHTM-SOP-005) and relevant SOPs at the respective MRC Units in Gambia and Uganda.  \\n\\nResearch partners should agree on a collaboration agreement that clearly indicates the rights they possess and permissions they provide to ensure research data can be used for current and future research. Rights will often be owned by the host institution(s) in which researchers are based, rather than the researcher themselves, therefore it is important that this agreement is reviewed and approved by the relevant institution’s legal team. Advice on preparing collaboration agreements and sample templates can be obtained from the LSHTM Legal Services Office.  \\n\\nExclusive rights to ownership or use of research data should not be handed over to a third party, unless it is a condition imposed by contractual or other obligations, without first consulting the Research Data Manager or LSHTM Legal Services Office for advice. Instead, researchers are encouraged to apply a non-exclusive licence that enables research data to be accessed and used by many parties.  \\n\\nFurther information can be found in the LSHTM Good Research Practice Policy and LSHTM Intellectual Property Policy.  \\n\\n### 3.4. Research data must be securely stored and managed throughout the time period they are retained  \\n\\nResearch data and other research assets must be securely stored and managed throughout the time period that they are held. This must ensure the confidentiality of information, protect against data loss and corruption, and comply with requirements that apply to the research. This includes ethical, legal, contractual, or other requirements, most notably the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 (UK DPA 2018).  \\n\\nThe managed storage environment may be operated by LSHTM and/or a trusted third party. Advice and guidance on classifying research data by its sensitivity level and selecting appropriate storage methods are available in the LSHTM Data Classification and Handling Policy and LSHTM Data Storage Options document.  \\n\\nIn circumstances where a managed storage environment is not available (e.g. when working in the field), researchers must take all reasonable steps to ensure adequate measures are in place to protect research data and ensure they are not held in a jurisdiction that offers lower levels of protection than available in the UK. The research data must be transferred into a managed storage environment at the earliest opportunity.  \\n\\nAdvice on LSHTM storage systems may be sought from LSHTM IT Services.  \\n\\n### 3.5. Documentation should be sufficient to access, understand, verify and reuse research data  \\n\\nThe ability to access, understand and use research data for the purpose of research verification or new research, is dependent upon the existence and availability of documentation that is full, clear and accurate.  \\n\\nResearchers should ensure that they produce documentation that complies with research practices and reporting guidelines appropriate to the scientific domain(s) in which their research is conducted.  \\n\\nResearch data that are made available should be supported by documentation that enable others to access, understand and use it, without the need to contact the study authors. Documentation that may be shared include: data collection tools, research protocols and procedures, participant informed consent forms, processing scripts, software code, data dictionaries and other outputs.  \\n\\nFurther information on documentation practices can be found in the LSHTM Standard Operating Procedure on Good Documentation Practice (LSHTM-SOP-022).  \\n\\n### 3.6. Research data that contribute to research findings must be retained for the time period that they are needed  \\n\\nResearchers are responsible for ensuring research data necessary to verify and reproduce research findings are retained for the time period that they are needed.  \\n\\nResearch data produced by a researcher must be kept in digital and/or physical form for a minimum of 10 years following funding completion, in accordance with LSHTM’s Records Retention and Disposal Schedule.  \\n\\nA minimum retention period longer than 10 years may be specified by third parties for specific types of research. For instance, research data produced as part of a clinical trial must be kept for a minimum of 25 years. Similarly, research data that underpins published research findings must often be made available for a minimum of 10 years after the date that it was published, in accordance with journal requirements.  \\n\\nData provided by a third party that contains a contractual condition that it is held for a shorter time period are exempt from this requirement.  \\n\\nA decision to dispose of research data or other research assets under the researcher’s control may be made after the retention period has passed, in consultation with relevant staff. Appropriate documentation should be maintained on any research assets that are selected for disposal, in compliance with guidance outlined in the LSHTM Records Retention and Disposal Schedule and its supporting documents.  \\n\\nFurther information can be found in the LSHTM Standard Operating Procedure on Data Destruction (LSHTM SOP 043) and the LSHTM Records Retention and Disposal Schedule. Advice on retention requirements that apply to research data may be sought from the Research Data Manager or the Archives & Records Manager within Library, Archive & Open Research Services.  \\n\\n### 3.7. Research data that substantiate research findings should be made available at the earliest opportunity, in accordance with conditions that apply to the research  \\n\\nResearch data that substantiate research findings should be shared through a managed repository or enclave in a manner that is compatible with the ethical, legal, contractual, and/or other requirements that apply to research.  \\n\\nResearch data suitable for sharing should be made available within 12 months of the grant closure or at the point when research findings based on the work are published, whichever is sooner. Funder policies and community practices that stipulate more rapid sharing supersede this requirement.  \\n\\nAccess mechanisms applied to research data must comply with good research practice and conditions that apply to the research. Open access is encouraged where possible. However, controls upon access and use may be applied where necessary to fulfil ethical, legal, contractual or other requirements.  \\n\\nResearchers should take appropriate steps to identify and address barriers that may limit the ability to share research data. This may include ensuring that ethics and contractual documents recognise the need to share data with others, developing procedures and allocating resources to prepare data for sharing.  \\n\\nAn exemption may be sought for research data covered by ethical, legal, contractual, or other conditions that prohibit sharing. Researchers that have not obtained explicit consent to share data within participant informed consent forms and/or collaboration agreements and who are subsequently required to make data available should seek advice from the Research Governance & Integrity Office and/or the Research Data Manager.  \\n\\nFurther information can be found in the LSHTM Standard Operating Procedure on Informed Consent for Research (LSHTM SOP 005), LSHTM Standard Operating Procedure on Confidentiality and Anonymisation of Research Data (LSHTM-SOP-036) and LSHTM Data Access Procedures.  \\n\\n### 3.8. Research data that are made available for access must include details of institutional affiliation, funder, and author identifiers  \\n\\nResearch data that are made available for access must provide the name and institutional affiliation of each author/contributor, as well as any research identifiers that are associated with the research.  \\n\\nResearchers must use the correct institutional affiliation when publishing research to which they have contributed so that it may be identified as an institutional output. This will be either ‘London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine’; ‘Medical Research Council Unit The Gambia at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine’; or ‘Medical Research Council/Uganda Virus Research Institute and London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine Uganda Research Unit’.  \\n\\nResearch data must clearly acknowledge the funding source(s) and grant or programme number(s) in order to ensure that grant conditions are met and to enable research assets to be clearly linked to funders.  \\n\\nResearchers should have an ORCID identifier to enable robust linking between research assets and their creators.  \\n\\n3.9. Research data must be registered with LSHTM, irrespective of whether it is hosted there or elsewhere  \\n\\nResearch data intended for sharing must be registered with LSHTM on completion of funding or at the point when it is made available, whichever is sooner.  \\n\\nThis requirement applies to all LSHTM-led research, research in which LSHTM has been assigned formal responsibility for data collection, management, or sharing in a contract or subcontract, and research data that lists LSHTM researchers as a named contributor to the work.  \\n\\nResearchers undertaking consultancy work are encouraged to register research data that they produce if it does not breach confidentiality, contractual, or other obligations.  \\n\\nLibrary, Archive & Open Research Services maintains a digital repository, LSHTM Data Compass (  which may be used to register research data and other relevant research assets.  \\n\\n### 3.10. Published research should include information on how to access research data and other supporting material  \\n\\nGood research practice is built upon the recognition of all source material used in research. Researchers should ensure that all research assets that underpin research are cited in published research, following citation guidelines appropriate to their scientific domain.  \\n\\nResearchers must include a data access statement in published research where mandated by a research funder, sponsor, or publisher, even where there is no research data associated with the research or the research data cannot be shared.  \\n\\nAn access statement should be included that outlines where research data may be obtained and any associated conditions for access and use. A persistent identifier, such as a Digital Object Identifier (DOI), should be included where one is available.  \\n\\nAdvice is available from the Research Data Manager within Library, Archive & Open Research Services.  \\n\\n## 4 CONTACTS  \\n\\nQuestions related to the Research Data Management Policy and its implementation should be directed to the Research Data Manager within Library, Archive & Open Research Services.  \\n\\n## 5 DEFINITIONS  \\n\\nData Access Statement: A statement provided in published research that describes where research assets that underpin the paper are hosted, how they may be accessed, and any conditions of access and use.   \\nData Management Plan (DMP): A document that describes how research data and/or other research assets will be obtained, managed and shared during the research lifecycle and following its completion.  \\n\\nDigital repository: A system for storing, managing and sharing research assets, such as data and code. LSHTM Data Compass is an example of an institutional digital repository.  \\n\\nMetadata: Information that describes one or more research assets. Metadata may describe the content of a research asset, how it was obtained, and how it may be accessed and used.  \\n\\nNon-Exclusive Licence: A licence that grants the same rights to several licensees. This differs from an exclusive licence, which assigns rights to a specific licensee, to the exclusion of others.  \\n\\nPersistent Identifier (PID): A unique, stable, permanent reference to a digital object. Examples include the Open Researcher & Contributor ID (ORCiD) system to identify authors, and Digital Object Identifier (DOIs) system applied to journal articles and datasets.  \\n\\nPrincipal Investigator: The lead researcher or scientist for a project.  \\n\\nResearcher: Any person conducting research or involved in the creation, collection, or generation of research data for or on behalf of LSHTM. This may include, but not be limited to, employed staff, research students, and honorary staff.  \\n\\nResearch Asset: A resource produced as part of the research process. This includes research data, code, scripts, collection tools, participant consent forms, and other resources.  \\n\\nResearch Funder: An agency responsible for the financial support of research activities.  \\n\\nResearch Project: A unit of work performed by one or more researchers that has been established for the purpose of addressing specific aims and objectives.  \\n\\nRetention Period: The time period for which the research data must be kept. The LSHTM Records Retention & Disposal Schedule states research data must be retained for a minimum of 10 years following project completion, with the recognition that third-party requirements that have a longer retention period will take precedent.  \\n\\n## 6 REFERENCES  \\n\\nConcordat on Open Research Data   \\n    \\nConcordatonOpenResearchData.pdf  \\n\\nCARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance',\n",

The University is committed to research excellence and integrity. As such, it seeks to promote high standards of research data management throughout the research data lifecycle.   \\n2.   New research proposals from 9th September 2016 should include research data management plans or protocols in line with funders’ policies. In other instances, research data management plans are encouraged. All plans should include responsibilities for data collection, documentation and metadata, ethical and legal compliance, storage and backup, selection of data of long-term value, preservation and data sharing.   \\n3.   Research data management plans should ensure that research data are available for access and re-use wherever appropriate and under appropriate safeguards.   \\n4.   To enable research data to be discoverable and effectively re-used by others, sufficient metadata should be recorded and made openly available via the University data repository. The link to the repository can be found here:     \\n5.   All research data of continuing value to the researcher and the wider research community, or specified by funding bodies, or required for legal or other regulatory purposes should be registered with the University, even that which is retained elsewhere, for example in an international data service or domain repository.   \\n6.   Research data that may be of future historical interest, including data that substantiate research findings, should normally be offered and assessed for deposit and retention in an appropriate data service or domain repository, or the University data repository.   \\n7.   The legitimate interests of the subjects of research data must be protected.   \\n8.   Exclusive rights to reuse or publish research data should not be handed over to commercial publishers or agents without retaining the rights to make the data openly available for reuse, unless this is a condition of funding.   \\n9.   Where any research is subject to any associated contractual arrangements and/or grant conditions that conflict with this policy, the provisions of such contractual arrangements and/or grant conditions will take precedence.  \\n\\n#### Researchers’ responsibilities  \\n\\nResponsibility for the creation of a research data management plan, the updating of that plan (where necessary), and the implementation of that plan throughout the research lifecycle during any research project or programme lies with Principal Investigators (PIs). Heads of Departments and Centres and others responsible for research staff and students should ensure that researchers in their areas are aware of the University’s policy regarding research data management and its associated guidelines and procedures.  \\n\\nResearchers are required to comply with the conditions of their of their research funders’ data policies.   \\nResearchers should ensure published results always include information on how to access the supporting data.   \\nPIs should review their data holdings assessing their research value e.g. for potential future use in research and education, and wider applications for policy, commerce or public interests.   \\nPIs should notify the University of their data holdings and supply the Data Asset Register (currently the University data repository) with metadata relating to their data.  \\n\\n### University’s responsibilities  \\n\\nThe University will provide access to training, support, advice and, where appropriate, guidelines and templates for research data management and research data management plans.   \\nThe University will provide access to mechanisms and services for storage, backup, registration, valuation, deposit and retention of research data assets in support of current and future access, during and after completion of research projects.   \\nThe University reserves the right to appraise and review its data holdings in consultation with PIs and appropriate experts.   \\nThis policy will be reviewed and updated through the Research Committee in consultation with appropriate stakeholders.  \\n\\n### Relationship with existing policies  \\n\\nResearch data will be managed in accordance with the University’s other policies and guidelines, such as:  \\n\\nEthics Approvals (Human Participants) Sub-Committee   \\n(   \\nparticipants/additionalinformation/)   \\nIntellectual property (    \\nData Protection Policy (    \\nCopyright (    \\nFreedom of Information (    \\nIT Acceptable Use Policy (    \\nInstitutional Repository Policy – Open Access Policy   \\n(\",\n",
       " '# Lund univeRsiTy  \\n\\nJoint Faculties of Humanities and Theology  \\n\\nWorking committee of the Faculty Board  \\n\\n## Guidelines concerning research data storage at the Faculties of Humanities and Theology  \\n\\nLund University is a public authority and is therefore obliged to preserve, organise and maintain all public documents from the University’s activities (Swedish Archives Act 1990:782, section 3). As documents resulting from research at the Faculties of Humanities and Theology are increasingly digital, it is of the utmost importance to establish procedures to ensure that the data will remain available in a way that corresponds to the current paper documents.  \\n\\nThe long-term goal of introducing these new procedures is to promote:  \\n\\nopen research   \\ngood research practice and good data management in the research process good regulatory compliance   \\nfuture access to research data.  \\n\\nResearch data1 refers to all types of research documents defined in Lund University’s document management plan2, i.e. both those to be preserved and those to be disposed of after a specified retention period. Any disposal must be in accordance with the Swedish National Archives’ regulations. The rules that apply can be found in the document “Gallrings- och bevarandeplan för forskningshandlingar inom de Humanistiska och teologiska fakulteterna” (Disposal and preservation plan for research documents at the Faculties of Humanities and Theology), reg. no V 2019/2171. Storage of research data should also take into account current rules regarding e.g. information and IT security, personal data processing and ethical principles.  \\n\\nDoctoral students’ research documents are considered part of Lund University’s portfolio of public documents and are therefore also covered by these guidelines.  \\n\\nWhen the term “researcher” is used below, it refers all research staff, regardless of the type of employment, and thus also all research students.  \\n\\nThe short-term goal of introducing these procedures is to clarify the organisation’s requirements and expectations of researchers, and to:  \\n\\nsupport researchers in their data management by providing storage space   \\nfor research data during and after the project period   \\nensure that the faculty’s research data can always be found, without help   \\nfrom the researcher   \\nprepare for the possibility of somewhat automatically transferring data and   \\nmetadata to a planned e-archive at Lund University, without requiring each   \\nresearcher to participate in the process  \\n\\nIn addition to having a clearly identified location for research project data3, we need to be able to distinguish between active data and archived data. We also need to organise the data in a structured manner. Long-term preservation must take place in open file formats that make the data accessible even in the long term.  \\n\\nThe legal rights and obligations apply, irrespective of the choice of storage solution. The same rules apply as long as the document is stored with the public authority – regardless of where or how it is stored.  \\n\\nBear in mind that there are other requirements that apply to research data, in addition to these storage guidelines. If, for example, the project processes personal data, this must be reported via the PULU4 form. Ethical review may also be required, etc.  \\n\\nBy following the research data storage procedures below, we also:  \\n\\nsatisfy the Swedish Archives Act’s requirement to preserve and keep research documents organised   \\nare able to link research projects in LUCRIS to their research data   \\nenable secure storage during the project period and prepare for e-archiving ensure that research data remains at LU, even after the researcher’s employment has terminated   \\nenable responding, if necessary, to suspicions of research misconduct by being able to produce evidence in the form of preserved research data facilitate the creation of well-organised data sets that can easily be cited, shared and re-used by the researcher or others to answer new research questions, if needed.  \\n\\n### Research data storage procedures at the Faculties of Humanities and Theology  \\n\\nThe procedures apply to all researchers working at the Faculties of Humanities and Theology and to all research projects that have their main residence at one of the faculty organisations. In brief, this means that the research data during the project period should, and at the end of the project must:  \\n\\nbe stored in a project folder associated with the applicable storage solution be organised according to the standard structure   \\ncontain metadata about the project and its data   \\ncontain the necessary documentation   \\nbe stored in open file format   \\nbe given file names that facilitate understanding of the content   \\nbe disposed of5, if possible, at the end of the retention period.  \\n\\nThe research project manager in charge is also responsible for ensuring that the project’s research data is stored securely throughout the project period and that the right people have access to the project data. You must also ensure that the necessary decisions on disposal/preservation are taken no later than at the end of the project (see below).  \\n\\nBelow are more detailed descriptions of the requirements and related comments.  \\n\\nDuring the project period, the project data must be stored in a work folder specifically intended for the project, in the storage solution provided by the IT unit.  \\n\\nThis ensures secure storage of data during the project period. If another storage solution is chosen, for example, if an equivalent solution is provided by another IT provider, an assessment of information security must be made. In cases where the research data is of such a sensitive nature that the storage solution does not meet all the information security considerations or ethical principles, another storage solution must be chosen6.  \\n\\nThe project folder shall contain the following four main subfolders:  \\n\\nAdministration Method   \\nData   \\nResearch output  \\n\\nOnly research documents that are not suitable for LUCRIS may be added to the Research output folder.  \\n\\nThe requirement applies primarily to the archived project folder, but in order to avoid further work in connection with the archiving process, we recommend that you apply this structure in the project folder already during the project period. The research project manager is free to determine the organisation of the data within these folders, but consideration should be given to making the structure understandable and logical for other researchers.  \\n\\nMetadata on the project and its data shall be stored in the Data folder.  \\n\\nAt least one README file shall be placed at the top of the folder. The text should explain what can be found in the folder, how different files relate to each other, etc. in order for other researchers to understand and possibly utilise the research data.  \\n\\nThe minimum requirement for project metadata is based on the “OpenAIRE guidelines for Data Archives”7, which in turn are based on the Dublin Core8. Metadata is important for future indexing, searching and possibly also statistics. Text elements that are part of the metadata structure must be written in either Swedish or English. The libraries at the Faculties of Humanities and Theology provide a template for this. The template includes requirements for a link to the project in LUCRIS.  \\n\\nIf necessary, additional README files or other information documents may be added to the structure if deemed necessary by the research project manager.  \\n\\nRequired documentation in addition to metadata.   \\nOther documentation that is necessary for an outside researcher to understand and interpret the contents of the folder may be e.g. method descriptions, field journals and manuals for applied software or hardware. The files in the folder must be stored in open file format.   \\nThe choice of file format for digital documents is very important in order to ensure that the data will remain accessible in the future. Non-proprietary open formats shall be used as far as possible. The choice of format shall be based on the Swedish National Archives’ regulations and general advice on technical requirements for electronic documents9.  \\n\\nFile names that facilitate understanding of the content shall be used.  \\n\\nThe choice of file name is important, but what constitutes a good file name depends on the context. Use names that make the content understandable as well as logical to external researchers.  \\n\\nOn completion of the project, the project data shall be stored in a designated project folder in the archived storage solution provided by the IT unit. The data to be preserved shall be kept separate from the data deemed eligible for disposal.  \\n\\nThe research project manager is responsible for archiving any documents in the project folder that are to be preserved and that a decision on possible disposal is taken no later than at the end of the project period – which does not necessarily coincide with the termination of funding. Decisions on disposal must always be taken in accordance with current regulations (see “Gallrings- och bevarandeplan för forskningshandlingar vid de Humanistiska och teologiska fakulteterna” (Disposal and preservation plan for research documents at the Faculties of Humanities and Theology), reg. no V 2019/2171)10, i.e. disposal of documents requires approval from the head of department.  \\n\\nFor research ethical reasons, research data shall be stored for at least 10 years after publication, in order to enable critical review of the research findings.  \\n\\nIf the project processes personal data, this must be reported to the data protection officer at the end of the project, as the register (the PULU system) must only contain ongoing processing of personal data.  \\n\\nData eligible for disposal are automatically disposed of at the end of the retention period.  \\n\\nAfter assessing the preservation value, which is done in consultation between researchers and the head of department (see above), the IT unit transfers the documents deemed disposable after the retention period by the head of department to the corresponding folder at the intermediate archive of the Faculties of Humanities and Theology. The documents will automatically be disposed of at the end of the retention period. The documents that are to be preserved remain in the project folder, which is then transferred in its entirety to the storage solution for archived material.  \\n\\n#### Further information in related instructions  \\n\\nFor more detailed instructions on how to apply these procedures in practice, for example, which files to store and which file formats are approved, see the Instructions for research data storage at the Faculties of Humanities and Theology (“Anvisningar för forskningsdatalagring vid HT-fakulteterna”). The research support offered by the faculty libraries, in collaboration with the IT unit, also includes support with regard to research data storage and the procedures laid down in the present guidelines.',\n",
       " \"# Manchester Metropolitan University Research Data Management Policy  \\n\\n## 1. Introduction  \\n\\n1.1 Manchester Metropolitan University firmly believes that good research data management is the foundation of good research, since it allows for the verification of findings and supports digital preservation.  \\n\\n1.2 Publicly funded research data are a public good, produced in the public interest, which should be made openly available with as few restrictions as possible in a timely and responsible manner.1  \\n\\n1.3 The benefits of opening up research data for scrutiny and reuse are potentially very significant; including economic growth, increased resource efficiency, securing public support for research funding and increasing public trust in research. However, openness requires more  \\n\\n1.4 than disclosure of data. All those engaged with research have a responsibility to ensure that the data they gather and generate is properly managed, accessible, intelligible, and usable by others unless there are legitimate reasons to the contrary2.  \\n\\n1.5 The University supports FAIR Principles for data sharing making data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable.    \\n\\n## 2. Purpose  \\n\\n2.1 Manchester Metropolitan University has a clear strategy to develop the research environment and ensure research excellence. This policy demonstrates the University’s commitment to adhering to and promoting research data management best practice throughout the research lifecycle and is in accordance with the Concordat on Open Research Data and its principles. This policy outlines the responsibilities of both the  \\n\\nUniversity and its researchers in relation to research data management and sets out the support and guidance that is available.  \\n\\n## 3. Scope  \\n\\n3.1 This policy applies to any individual engaging in research as part of their employment or studies at the University, involving in the creation, collection, generation, processing or destruction of research data, regardless of whether or not the research is funded.  \\n\\n3.2 Researcher leaders, supervisors and mentors should ensure that their collaborators, colleagues and students are aware of the relevant research data management requirements and have a clear understanding of appropriate practice.  \\n\\n## 4. Definitions  \\n\\n### 4.1 Researcher  \\n\\nA Researcher references any individual engaging in research as part of their employment or studies at the University.  \\n\\n### 4.2 Research Data  \\n\\nUK Research and Innovation (UKRI) defines research data as 'the evidence that underpins the answer to the research question, and can be used to validate findings regardless of its form (e.g. print, digital or physical).  \\n\\nThese might be quantitative information or qualitative statements collected by researchers in the course of their work by experimentation, observation, modelling, interview or other methods, or information derived from existing evidence. Data may be raw or primary (e.g. direct from measurement or collection) or derived from primary data for subsequent analysis or interpretation (e.g. cleaned up or as an extract from a larger data set), or derived from existing sources where the rights may be held by others.  \\n\\nData may be defined as 'relational' or 'functional' components of research, thus signalling that their identification lies in whether and how researchers use them as evidence for claims.  \\n\\nThey may include, for example, statistics, collections of digital images, sound recordings, transcripts of interviews, survey data and fieldwork observations with appropriate annotations, an interpretation, an artwork, archives, found objects, published texts or a manuscript.3  \\n\\nManchester Metropolitan University recognises three main states for research data:  \\n\\nActive research data (e.g. live digital project data in the research data storage platform) Archived research data (e.g. ‘finished’ / ‘end of project’ data prepared for long-term preservation. This may contain sensitive personal information. This is archived for legal, regulatory or contractual purposes and is not publicly accessible) Reusable research data (e.g. a dataset that has been made findable, sharable and available for reuse through the most appropriate repository / data archive. This is subject to ethical, legal  \\n\\nand contractual requirements)  \\n\\nFor the purposes of this policy ‘research data’ refers to active, archived or reusable data, that is created, collected, generated, processed or destroyed by any researcher at the University.  \\n\\n### 4.3 Data Management Plans (DMPs)  \\n\\nA Data Management Plan (DMP) is a formal statement describing how data will be managed and documented throughout a research project. A DMP should address the capture, handling, integrity, confidentiality, preservation, sharing, publication and destruction of the research data. DMPs are living documents and therefore should be periodically reviewed and updated to ensure their effectiveness. Manchester Metropolitan University expects all research data to have an associated and proportionate DMP.  \\n\\n### 4.4 Metadata  \\n\\nMetadata are defined as information about data. In the context of research data management this concerns any descriptive or contextual information related to research data that contributes towards its discoverability, long-term preservation, and reuse. Metadata can range from simple explanatory text documents to extensive structured metadata schemas.  \\n\\n## Roles and Responsibilities  \\n\\n### 4.5 Researcher’s Responsibilities  \\n\\n4.5.1 The Principal Investigator (PI) is responsible for ensuring ethical approval is obtained for all research projects beforeany data collection takes place.  \\n\\n4.5.2 The PI has overall responsibility for research data management before, during and after any project or programme. Research data management duties may be shared or delegated but should be clearly outlined in a DMP.  \\n\\n4.5.3 All researchers are responsible for familiarising themselves with the research project DMP and complying with all legal4, contractual, ethical or regulatory requirements that are associated with the data in their research project.  \\n\\n4.5.4 All researchers are responsible for ensuring their project data are processed, transferred and stored in a secure manner that preservesits integrity. Active data must be securely stored on the University’s research data storage platform, or an appropriate alternative, in accordance with the specified contractual requirements.  \\n\\n4.5.5 Where data ownership may be ambiguous (e.g.in collaborative projects with external organisations), the PI will be responsible for clarifying responsibilities.  \\n\\n4.5.6 The PI is responsible for appraising and preparing active data for archiving and reuse. Data that is shared should align with FAIR principles, use a suitable format to allow verification of published research findings, and be of long-term academic value.  \\n\\n4.5.7 The Pl is responsible for ensuring the research dataare suitably archived and shared in the University’s research repository (or appropriate alternative), subject to specific legal, contractual, ethical or regulatory requirements.  \\n\\n4.5.8 The PI is responsible for destroying data that cannot be retained due to legal requirements or that is not of long-term value as specified in the DMP.  \\n\\n### 4.6 The University’s Responsibilities  \\n\\n4.6.1   The University is responsible for providing appropriate infrastructure for secure data storage through a centralised storage solution in order to ensure the safety, integrity and accessibility of live research data.  \\n\\n4.6.2   The University provides an archive and research repository for the archiving, sharing, and long-term preservation of research data.  \\n\\n4.6.3   The University is responsible for the provision of training, support and advice on research data management.  \\n\\n## 5. Sharing and Discoverability  \\n\\n5.1 Data sharing should be considered at the beginning of the project and provision outlined in the DMP.  \\n\\n5.2 Appropriate mechanisms must be in place before sharing sensitive and confidential research data. This includes, but is not limited to, anonymising and pseudonymising data, obtaining correct permissions, and carefully controlling access to data. These issues should be explicitly addressed in a DMP.  \\n\\n5.3 Research data and associated metadata which substantiate published research findings should be made openly available, where possible, no later than the date of first online publication or the end of the research project, whichever is sooner.  \\n\\n5.4 Research data deposited in the University’s research repository will be securely archived in line with requirements specified in the University’s Retention and Disposal schedule5, unless specific legal, contractual, ethical or regulatory requirements apply.  \\n\\n5.5 If the data are stored elsewhere, such as in a national or disciplinespecific repository, a metadata record must be created in the University’s research repository to facilitate discovery and reuse.  \\n\\n5.6 Research data should be assigned an appropriate copyright licence that encourages the sharing and reuse of the accessible dataset.  \\n\\n5.7 A Data Access Statement or Data Availability Statement (DAS) should accompany publications outlining the availability of the data.  \\n\\n## 6. Rights and Restrictions  \\n\\n6.1 It is not always possible or appropriate to make research data open, but any restrictions to access must be justified. Such as where the costs of preserving or supplying the data are disproportionate.  \\n\\n6.2 Access to research data via the University’s research repository can be restricted where necessary to comply with contractual, ethical, legislative or regulatory requirements.  \\n\\n6.3 The legitimate interests of research subjects must be protected. When gaining informed consent, researchers should include provision for data sharing and be fully transparent in how the data are to be used. Any personal data must be anonymised prior to publication and access to sensitive or confidential information must be carefully controlled.  \\n\\n6.4 All research data at the University are subject to the University’s Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) Policy.  \\n\\n6.5 Researchers involved in the creation of original research data retain the right to exclusive first use for an appropriate and well-defined period. Any period of exclusive use should be set out in the DMP and should be balanced against the public interest in release.  \\n\\n## 7. Associated Relevant Documents  \\n\\nThis policy should be read in conjunction with the University’s other policies and guidelines6  \\n\\n## 8.

Increased developments in computational advances,internationalization and data protection regulations present significant new opportunities and challenges in this regard.  \\n\\nThe purpose of this policy is to provide a framework that defines the responsibilities of the MDCmanagement and its researchers, and to provide guidance for the proper management of research data throughout its full life cycle.This includes promoting data sharing and re-use to the widest extent feasible, in order to maximize research transparency, quality and impact.  \\n\\nThe MDC is committed to a goal of making data created as part of the research process compliant with the FAIR principles[1] .Data should be: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable. Implementation of this policy also aims to ensure conformity with pertinent legal obligations, ethical responsibilities and the rules of funding bodies, including the:  \\n\\nHelmholtz Association position paper [2] and guidelines [3] on research data management   \\nresearch software   \\nGuidelines of the German Research Foundation for handling research data [4] and good   \\nscientific practice [5]   \\nFederal Data Protection Act [6]   \\nBerlin Data Protection Act [7]   \\nEU Open Science Policy [8]   \\nEU General Data Protection Regulation [9]  \\n\\n### 1.Jurisdiction  \\n\\nThis policy was developed based on consensus discussion among working group members from the Helmholtz Health Centers, and was approved by the MDC board of directorates on 01.03.2021.It applies to all researchers active at the MDC. In cases when research is funded by a third party, any agreements made with that party concerning intellectual property rights,access rights and the storage of research data take precedence over this policy.  \\n\\n### 2.Intellectual property rights  \\n\\nIntellectual property rights and ownership determine the basic conditions for use and sharing of research data. The MDC technology transfer office serves as the first point of contact regarding Intellectural Property Rights (IPR) questions about research data/results and initiates suitable protection measures where appropriate.  \\n\\n### 3.Handling research data  \\n\\nResearchers are strongly encouraged to develop a written Data Management Plan (DMP) at the design stage of each project, even when not specifically required with the assistance and support of the Research Data Management unit.  \\n\\n#### Data storage  \\n\\nResearch data must be stored in a correct, complete, unadulterated and reliable manner in order to preserve its integrity.Furthermore, data must be identifiable (including through use of persistent identifiers), accessible,traceable, interoperable and, whenever possible,available for subsequent use. All research data generated and elaborated at the MDC must be stored at the MDc, in the institutional storage systems, with secure backup storage.Data may be also archived/shared in reliable trusted external repositories, in addition to the institutional storage,under written agreement.Incoming data from other institutions or repositories to be stored at the MDC must be accompanied by appropriate written agreements in consultation with the Legal department and the Data Protection Office.Storage infrastructures should be compliant with best practices in the field as well as technical specifications per legal requirements.  \\n\\nWhere research involves the collection, processing and/or use of identifiable personal data, the storage and sharing of the data must comply with relevant ethical, legal,disciplinary and regulatory requirements and be in line with the consent under which the data was collected or provided.  \\n\\nResearch data and related material should be retained for a minimum of ten years after acquisition or generation based on the recommendation of the DFG (in English [10], German [11]).Longer or shorter retention periods prevail in accordance to legal regulations, funders\\' and other contractual requirements (e.g. clinical trials, patents).  \\n\\n#### Data access and re-use  \\n\\nThe MDC supports access to research data following the European Commission for Open Data principle [12], \"as open as possible,as closed as necessary.This includes not only the data/dataset itself, but also elements such as metadata, methods, protocols and software/code needed to support effective data use.The use of open-source software/code to support analysis is strongly encouraged in-line with European Open Science guidelines [13] and recommendations.  \\n\\nWhen licensing is indicated to allow data sharing and re-use, the data should be made available under an open license, unless legal obligations, third party rights, intellectual property rights and privacy rights preclude this (e.g.Creative Commons [14] and licenses approved by the Open Source Initiative [15]).  \\n\\nIn publications and any other presentations of data,the data sources (original and subsequently-used) must be acknowledged and traceable in accordance with the MDC publication policy, see table Related Documents.  \\n\\n#### Deletion of data  \\n\\nDeletion or destruction of research data and records,either after expiration of the retention period or for legal or ethical reasons, has to be carried out considering contractual obligations of third-party funders and other stakeholders, including collaboration partners.Such actions should be documented and be accessible for future audit. Backup data copies should also be deleted.Automated deletion of research data is to be avoided. Plans outlining data deletion and destruction should be documented and agreed upon between the principal investigators or data producers with the IT department; see section 5 for more details on roles and responsibilities.  \\n\\n### 4.Responsibilities, rights, duties  \\n\\nMDC-Management, Principal Investigators (PIs) and all researchers at the MDc, hold the primary responsibility for compliance with this policy and the responsibility for research data management during and after a research project.  \\n\\nFurthermore, compliance with the \"Guidelines for Safeguarding Good Scientific Practice\"of the German Research Foundation(DFG) and the \"Rules for safeguarding good scientific practice at the Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine (MDc) as well as relevant policies and guidelines, see table Related Documents, should be taken into account in all aspects of research activities.  \\n\\nIn cases where research is funded by a third party any agreements made with that party concerning intellectual property rights, access rights and the storage of research data take precedence over this policy.  \\n\\n#### Principal Investigators and Researchers are responsible for:  \\n\\na)Management of research data and data sets through their life cycle in adherence with principles and requirements expressed in the MDC\\'s policies, see table Related Documents.   \\nb) Definition of the DMPs including responsible person(s), general responsibilities and decisions (e.g.about sharing/access, central storage of datadata deletionquality of content, definition of formats).This responsibility lies with the Principal Investigator(s) generating the data.   \\nc) Allocation of appropriate resources (time and financial resources) for data management in grant proposals.   \\nd) Registration of proposals for third party funded projects with the Research Funding Department [16] of the MDC, to ensure appropriate institutional support.   \\ne Collection, documentation, archiving,access to and storage or proper destruction of research data and research-related records. This also includes the definition of protocols and responsibilities within a joint research project.Such information should be included in a DMP, as well as in protocols that explicitly define the collection, administration, integrity,. confidentiality, storage, use and publication of data that will be employed.   \\nf) Compliance with the general requirements of the funders and the research institution.   \\ng) Planning to enable, wherever possible, the continued use of data even after project completion. This includes defining post-project usage rights, with the assignation of appropriate licenses, as well as the clarification of data storage and archiving in the case of discontinued involvement of the researcher(s)at the MDC.  \\n\\nh)Acknowledgment of data sources and abiding by the terms and conditions under which original data was accessed.  \\n\\n#### The MDC is responsible for:  \\n\\na)Provisioning its researchers and research groups with a basic research infrastructure that includes tools and services for supporting the management, use,findability and sharing of data as well as with the capacity for appropriate storage, preservation, computing and processing. Provisioning of specific requirements by the researchers to carry out their research activities, are taken into consideration and require detailed discussions by all stakeholders involved (e.g. including the researchers, RDM, IT and purchasing).   \\nb)Providing support training, guidance and advice on research data management starting from planning to execution and thus enable researchers to exercise their responsibilities outlined above and to comply to requirements of third-party funders and other legal entities.   \\nc) Supporting retention of research data sets and related metadata and software in the appropriate format in line with its agreed policy and those of its research funders.   \\nd) Supporting the identification and resolution of legal issues to research data.   \\ne Allocation of appropriate and sufficient workforce as well as financial support for IT and RDM activities.  \\n\\n### 5. Definitions  \\n\\nResearch is any creative and systematically performed work with the goal of furthering knowledge, including discoveries regarding people, culture and society, in addition to the use of such knowledge for new applications.  \\n\\nPrincipal investigator is the most senior researcher associated with the research and the primary. individual responsible for the research project implementation, management and integrity of the design, conduct, and reporting. Additionally, the Pl holds the responsibility for the direction and oversight of compliance.  \\n\\nResearchers refers to all members of an institution including employed scientists students and support staff as well as others with a formal affiliation at [name of research institution], who have access to, generate and/or manage research data.Visiting researchers or collaborators may also be expected to comply with the policy.  \\n\\nResearch data refers to all information (independent of form or presentation) needed to support or validate the development results observations or findings of a research project,including contextual information. Research data include all materials that are created in the course of academic work, including digitization, records, source research, experiments, measurements, surveys and interviews.. This includes methods/protocols, metadata, software and code.Research data can take on several forms: during the lifespan of a research project, data can exist as gradations of raw data, processed data (including negative and inconclusive results), shared data, published data and Open Access published data, and with varying levels of access, including open data,restricted data and closed data.  \\n\\nMetadata [17] is data providing information about data that makes findable, trackable and (re)usable. It can include information such as contact information, geographic locations, details about units of measure,abbreviations or codes used in the dataset, instrument and protocol information,survey tool details, provenance and version information and much more.  \\n\\nData sharing is the practice of making scientific data used for scholarly research available to others, for research re-use or in knowledge transfer activities (e.g.researchers, institutions,the broader public).  \\n\\nThe general outline and some text in this policy were adopted from the resources of the LEARN Project (   \\n\\n### 6.References  \\n\\n1Wilkinson MDDumontier MAalbersberg JAppleton GAxton M Baak Aet al.The FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship.Scientific Data.2016;3: 1-9.   \\n2)  upload/01 forschung/Open Access/DE AkOs T G-Forschungsdatenleitlinie Positionspapier.pdf   \\n3)Helmholtz Open Science, External Organizations LibraryScientific Infrastructure and Platforms,GFZ Publication Database,Deutsches GeoForschungsZentrum.Empfehlungen fur Richtlinien der Helmholtz-Zentren zum Umgang mit Forschungsdaten.

It strives to promote the highest standard in this regard in accordance with the FAIR principles. Accurate, easily retrievable and traceable research data are a fundamental and integral part of any scientific research activity. These data are also essential in that they allow research processes and results to be reviewed and defended, among other things. Research data are of lasting value to research and teaching, opening up the potential for their broad use by members of society.  \\n\\nResearch data shall be handled exclusively in accordance with the applicable national and international legal provisions.  \\n\\nDue to the diversity of research data and processes, it is not possible to define uniform guidelines for the management of research data in detail (e.g. with regard to file structures, repositories, software, metadata). In addition, both the requirements and data management systems develop differently and extremely dynamically in specific research areas. For these reasons, this policy establishes general principles that are independent of research topics and will be continuously adapted as a living document to take into account current developments.  \\n\\n## 1. Scope  \\n\\nThis research data management policy refers to the collection, documentation, processing, utilisation, storage and further use of data and applies to all persons working at Med Uni Graz (e.g. researchers, non-scientific employees involved in the research process, students, doctors and employees of the University Hospital Graz and guest researchers) and their research activities. In principle, the policy also applies to those research activities that are promoted, financed, or materially supported by a third party and should be reflected in the corresponding contracts insofar as possible. If questions arise, the provisions established in the specific contract take precedence over the provisions of this policy.  \\n\\n## 2. Usage rights  \\n\\nMed Uni Graz is entitled to exercise the unrestricted right to use data generated on behalf of or in the interest of Med Uni Graz for commercial and non-commercial purposes of exploitation with regard to all types of exploitation, including the right to edit these data, without any restrictions in terms of time and place. Section 106 (2) and (3) of the UG (Universities Act, in German: Universitätsgesetz) and the applicable provisions of the Patent Act (in German: Patentgesetz) apply to service inventions. The authors or inventors retain the legally reserved right to be named, the right to receive remuneration for service inventions, the right of university staff to independently publish scientific work and the right to be named as a (co-)author in the publication of research results.  \\n\\n# MU Medizinische Universitat Graz  \\n\\nInsofar as the primary right to use the data is contractually granted to third legal entities (e.g. in the case of contract research agreements), it must be ensured that Med Uni Graz is in any case granted those rights of disposal over the data that are necessary to fulfil its data storage obligations to support good scientific practice. Furthermore, Med Uni Graz should be granted the right to use the results generated over the course of research activities for non-commercial research, teaching and, if possible, patient care.  \\n\\n# MU Medizinische Universitat Graz  \\n\\nIn order to comply with data protection regulations, the transfer of personal data to third parties is only permissible if the consent of a data clearing house is provided and with respect to legally compliant contractual agreements. The personal data to be reviewed should also include genetic and biometric data as well as data derived from biological material. The legality of the transfer of personal, pseudonymised, or anonymised data to third parties must be reviewed during the contractual review as part of the third-party funding process. If a data transfer is planned that is not regulated by a project contract, the research management must be informed in order to initiate a separate review, decision and, if necessary, contractual regulation process. The research management also represents the liaison to the Med Uni Graz data protection officer.  \\n\\nWhere possible and appropriate, research data must be provided with a corresponding licence to use the work in order to enable the re-use of these data, provided that no third-party rights, legal obligations, or disposal rights conflict with this re-use. In any case, compliance with any specifications issued by funding agencies regarding the type of licence to be granted must be ensured.  \\n\\n## 3. Handling research data  \\n\\n### 3.1. Basic information  \\n\\nResearch data and their metadata must be kept accurately, completely and reliably in accordance with good scientific practice to ensure the traceability of these data. Furthermore, efforts must be made to ensure the identifiability, findability, availability and, wherever possible, re-usability and interoperability of these data. If possible, the data should be given permanent identifiers.  \\n\\nRecords need to be kept of the methodology used to obtain the data, their processing (such as corrections, calculations, transformations, statistical analyses) and quality control measures. These records are considered as part of the data and should be archived together with these (metadata).  \\n\\nThe retention period for research data and records is – unless other legal regulations apply - dated least ten years either from the date of publishing the research results or, if no publication takes place, from the date of completing the relevant research activity. Justified deviations may result from the legal regulations (e.g. patent law, pharmaceutical law, requirements for the documentation of patient care), the requirements of third-party funding providers, or specific guidelines issued by the Rectorate.  \\n\\nIf research data and records are deleted or destroyed, this must be done in accordance with all legal and internal university requirements and in consideration of the aspect of traceability. The interests of other stakeholders (e.g. funding bodies) as well as aspects of confidentiality and security must be taken into account.  \\n\\nResearch data management must be organised at each organisational unit to ensure that individual persons can find and access certain data but also to guarantee the findability and accessibility of the data, even in the absence of individual persons involved in the research process. In justified cases and in accordance with good scientific practice, it must be ensured that direct access (e.g. for managers, project leaders) or indirect access (e.g. for co-authors of joint manuscripts/publications, project partners, research-supporting institutions, authorities) can be granted to relevant original data. Such access may be necessary, e.g. to complete manuscripts or  \\n\\n# MU Medizinische Universitat Graz  \\n\\nto answer questions that arise (e.g. with regard to validation, traceability and quality assurance). In any case, it is recommended that data management plans be drawn up at the beginning of specific research projects and that these plans also be developed independently of the funding bodies’ specifications with regard to their research projects. Data management plans for funded research projects should be deposited in the Research Portal (in German: Forschungsportal). The use of external repositories must be indicated in the data management plan.  \\n\\nIf third parties (e.g. funding bodies or journal editors) make requirements in this regard, research data must be stored and made accessible in a suitable repository, taking aspects of data protection into account.  \\n\\n### 3.2. Handling personal data  \\n\\nDuring research activities at Med Uni Graz, personal data are also processed (e.g. data from patients, test persons and employees). Personal data are placed under special protection by data protection regulations. Therefore, they should be processed and used properly, taking due care in accordance with the legal provisions. When dealing with health data and other sensitive data, the increased requirements of the data protection regulations must be met.  \\n\\nCompliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (in German: Datenschutzgrundverordnung, DSGVO), the Austrian Data Protection Act (in German: Datenschutzgesetz, DSG) and the Research Organisation Act (in German: Forschungsorganisationsgesetz, FOG) as well as any relevant Med Uni Graz guidelines (e.g. the guideline for data protection and IT security) must be ensured. This applies to the processing of electronic data as well as to information that is not processed through automation (e.g. on paper).  \\n\\n## 4. Responsibilities, rights and duties  \\n\\nThe responsibility with regard to research data management during and after a research activity is carried by Med Uni Graz and its researchers and the research support staff.  \\n\\n### 4.1. Responsibilities of the researchers  \\n\\nThe following tasks are the responsibility of the researchers:  \\n\\na. Management of research data within their own area of authority and in the sense of this policy   \\nb. Creation of data management plans   \\nc. Collection, documentation, storage, provision, archiving and, if necessary, destruction of the research data   \\nd. Fulfilment of the requirements of clients, sponsors, or funding bodies in this respect.   \\ne. Compliance with all legal, contractual and internal Med Uni Graz regulations regarding research data, data protection, IT security and good scientific practice  \\n\\n# MU Medizinische Universitat Graz  \\n\\n### 4.2. Responsibilities of Med Uni Graz  \\n\\nMed Uni Graz as an institution undertakes the responsibility to create conditions that enable staff to fulfil the requirements of this policy by promoting measures that support research. The following tasks are the responsibility of Med Uni Graz as an institution:  \\n\\na. Provision of policies and guidelines for the correct handling of research data   \\nb. Measures to raise awareness about the importance of research data management   \\nc. Training and continuing education offers in the field of research data management   \\nd. Advice on the collection, documentation, storage, provision, archiving and, if necessary, destruction of research data   \\ne.

Research data that are accurate and easily retrievable are the foundation and a fundamental component of any research activity. They are essential for reviewing and defending the research process and the research result, as well as for reuse of the data.  \\n\\nResearch data must be handled exclusively in accordance with the applicable national and international legal provisions.  \\n\\n### 2 Scope of Application  \\n\\nThis policy for the management of research data refers to the collection, processing, utilization, storage and reuse of research data and applies to all persons working at MedUni Vienna (e.g. researchers, employees, students and visiting researchers). If the specific research activity is promoted, financed or sponsored by a third party and the underlying contract contains special provisions regarding the research data, the provisions of the specific contract shall take precedence over the provisions of this Policy.  \\n\\n### 3 Rights of Use  \\n\\nUnless otherwise agreed in writing, MedUni Vienna shall be entitled to the scientific and commercial use of data collected and processed in the course of research activities. This shall not affect patent rights or other rights (of disposal). The authors or inventors retain the legally reserved right to be named, the right to service inventor remuneration, the right of university members to independent publication of scientific work as well as the right to be named as co-author in the publication of research results.  \\n\\nIf the primary right to use the data is contractually granted to a legal entity other than MedUni Vienna (e.g. in the case of contract research agreements), it must be ensured that MedUni Vienna is in any case granted those rights of disposal over the data that are necessary to fulfill its obligation of storing the data. Furthermore, it must be ensured that MedUni Vienna is granted the right to use the results generated in the course of the research activity for non-commercial research and teaching.  \\n\\nIn order to comply with data protection, the transfer of personal data to third parties is only permitted with the consent of the MedUni Vienna\\'s Data Clearing House and in compliance with contractual agreements in compliance with the law. The personal data to be reviewed by the Data Clearing House also include genetic and biometric data as well as data derived from biological material. Furthermore, the Data Clearing House reviews data that has already been anonymized or pseudonymized before it may be passed on to third parties.  \\n\\nIf required by the funding body, research data must be provided with a free license and made openly available for reuse, unless third-party rights, legal obligations or rights of disposal require otherwise.  \\n\\n### 4 Handling of Research Data  \\n\\n#### 4.1 General Principles  \\n\\nResearch data must be maintained in an accurate, complete, unaltered and reliable manner. Furthermore, identifiability, retrievability, availability and, wherever possible, reusability and interoperability must be ensured. If possible, the data must be provided with persistent identifiers.  \\n\\nRecords must be kept of the methodology used to obtain the data, its processing (such as corrections, calculations, transformations, statistical analyses), and quality control methods.  \\n\\nThe retention period for research data and records shall be at least ten years either from the publication of the research results or from the completion of the relevant research activity, unless provided otherwise by law. Justified deviations may result from legal provisions (e.g. patent law), requirements of third-party funding bodies or guidelines of the Rectorate.  \\n\\nIf research data and records are deleted or destroyed, this must be done in accordance with all legal and internal university requirements and under the aspect of traceability. The interests of other involved parties (e.g. funding bodies) as well as aspects of confidentiality and security must be taken into account.  \\n\\nResearch data must be made accessible within the MedUni Vienna\\'s area of disposition. If required by third parties (e.g. funding bodies or journal editors), research data must be stored and made accessible in a suitable repository, taking into account data protection. The use of an external repository must be reported to MedUni Vienna by means of a data management plan (DMP).  \\n\\nPersons working at MedUni Vienna (e.g. researchers, staff and students) and other authorized persons (e.g. institutions funding research; authorities) must have access to the original data in order to be able to answer questions that may arise (e.g. for validation, reproducibility and quality assurance).  \\n\\n#### 4.2 Handling of Personal Data  \\n\\nPersonal data are also processed in the course of research activities at MedUni Vienna (e.g. data of patients, test persons and employees). Personal data are specially protected by data protection regulations. They must therefore be properly processed and used with due care in accordance with the legal provisions. When dealing with health data, the increased requirements of data protection must be met.  \\n\\nThe Austrian Data Protection Act (Dsg) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDpR) must be obeyed at all times. This applies to the processing of electronic data as well as to information that is not processed automatically (e.g. on paper).  \\n\\nAware of its responsibility, MedUni Vienna has central facilities and internal guidelines (e.g. Good Scientific Practice) that aim to ensure the uniform handling of research data.  \\n\\n### 5 Responsibilities, Rights and Obligations  \\n\\nThe responsibility for research data management in the context of a research activity lies with both the researchers and the MedUni Vienna in accordance with the guidelines of the MedUni Vienna.  \\n\\n#### 5.1 Responsibilities of the Researchers  \\n\\nThe following duties fall under the responsibility of the researchers:  \\n\\nPreparation of data management plans\\'   \\nb. Management of research data   \\nAdherence to appropriate policies and guidelines with particular attention to data protection measures (e.g., defining access rights, storage locations, etc.)   \\nCollection, documentation, storage, provision, archiving, and, if necessary, destruction of research data   \\nMeeting the requirements of clients, sponsors, or funding agencies   \\nf. Compliance with all legal, contractual and internal MedUni Vienna regulations regarding research data  \\n\\n#### 5.2 Responsibilities of MedUni Vienna  \\n\\nMedUni Vienna undertakes to create the conditions for the fulfillment of this Policy by promoting research-supporting practices.  \\n\\nThe following duties fall under the responsibility of MedUni Vienna:  \\n\\na.  Measures to raise awareness of the importance of research data management (e.g. Third Party Funding Manual, Good Scientific Practice)   \\nb. Provision of directives for the uniform handling of research data   \\nOffering education and training in the area of research data management   \\nd. Provision of templates for data management plans, as well as guidance and training on creating and maintaining data management plans   \\nTechnical assistance, according to financial possibilities, and advice on the collection, documentation, storage, retrieval, archiving, and, if necessary, destruction of research data   \\nf. Provision of a processing directory in accordance with Art. 30 of the GDPR   \\ng. Advice and training on data protection with special attention to personal data   \\nh. Establishment of central institutions such as the intramural Data Protection Commission, the Data Clearing House, an ethics commission, and a data protection officer  \\n\\n### 6 Validity  \\n\\nThis policy was slightly adapted and confirmed by the Rectorate on January 13, 2021. It will be reviewed for validity by the Rectorate of the Medical University of Vienna at least every three years.',\n",

The guidelines can, through support and guidance, be a document that facilitates good and effective research data management in line with the increased demands of different actors within the research community. The guidelines complement Mid Sweden University’s policy for research data management.  \\n\\nPrevious versions: -  \\n\\n## Innehållsförteckning  \\n\\n### Guidelines for research data management at Mid Sweden University.  \\n\\nSubject matter. 3   \\nDefinition of research data 3   \\nDefinition of metadata. 3   \\nFAIR principles.. 3   \\nData Management Plans . 4   \\nResearch data in collaboration with others .5   \\nResponsibility for research data.. 5   \\nResearch data and results .6   \\nMaking research data accessible according to FAIR. .6   \\nScientific Ethical Consents.. 7   \\nResearch data as a public document.   \\nInformation security. .8   \\nPreservation and deletion of research data 8   \\nSupport function — DAU.. 9  \\n\\n# Guidelines for research data management at Mid Sweden University  \\n\\n## Subject matter  \\n\\nThe aim of the guidelines is to describe and explain the different aspects and principles that researchers at Mid Sweden University have to consider when managing research data. The guidelines are a document that, through support and guidance, facilitates good and effective research data management, in line with the increased demands of different actors. The guidelines complement Mid Sweden University’s policy for research data management (DNR: MIUN 2020/1906). See also our web resource about research data for more information.1  \\n\\n### Definition of research data  \\n\\nResearch data in this document refers to digital information that has been collected for analysis for a scientific purpose. Examples of research data are statistics and measurement data, transcribed interviews and survey responses, results from experiments, observations from fieldwork, recorded interviews (video/audio) and images.  \\n\\n### Definition of metadata  \\n\\nMetadata is structured information used to describe and categorise digital information, i.e., “information/data about data”. There are different types of metadata: descriptive, administrative, or structural. Descriptive metadata can be, for example, title or author, administrative metadata can be file formats, licenses, and rights, while structural metadata may be, for example, a static link such as a Digital Object Identifier (DOI).  \\n\\n## FAIR principles  \\n\\nAt EU and national level, there are requirements for publicly funded research to be made freely available. It includes both scientific publications and related research data. As a result, all research data funded in whole or in part from public funds shall be handled in accordance with the internationally accepted FAIR principles.  \\n\\nManaging research data according to the FAIR principles means making data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable. One benefit of managing data FAIR is that machine readability is considered. FAIR does not automatically mean that data should be made open access, but it should be described and made findable. FAIR data should be “as open as possible, as closed as necessary”.  \\n\\n### Data Management Plans  \\n\\nMid Sweden University recommends a data management plan for research projects containing research data. Several research funders require data management plans for projects that have been granted funding.  \\n\\nA data management plan is a document that aims to describe in a structured way the management of research data in a project. The data management plan should cover all phases of the project from planning and collecting, creating, or generating data, to analysis, publishing and archiving. The plan makes it easier to keep track of your data during the project and can also make it easier to comply with the FAIR principles. In addition, the data management plan may facilitate the preparation of an ethical review application.  \\n\\nDMPonline is a tool for creating data management plans recommended by research funders, including the Swedish Research Council. Mid Sweden University advises researchers to use DMPonline to create data management plans and offer support, review of data management plans and guidance.2  \\n\\n## Research data in collaboration with others  \\n\\nThe question of principality and who is responsible for research data can be complicated in collaborative research with other higher education institutions, organisations, private companies or healthcare.  \\n\\nWhen creating a data management plan, agreements should be established between the parties, which govern how the collaboration will work and how research data will be managed within the framework of the project. Agreements in that section may, for example, relate to who is responsible for which data, the handling of sensitive data or the costs associated with the data management.  \\n\\n### Responsibility for research data  \\n\\nAccording to the definition in the Ethics Review Act (Act on Ethics Review of Human Research (SFS 2003:460)), research principal is a government agency or a natural or legal person in whose activities the research is carried out. It is the research principal who, together with the individual researcher, is legally responsible for ensuring that the activities comply with the rules of the Ethics Review Act. In addition to the responsibility for data management Mid Sweden University is a public authority with archival responsibility.  \\n\\nArchiving legislation constitutes a mandatory legal framework and deals with issues relating to the preservation and deletion of documents at a public authority. It is also the higher education institution that assesses whether certain data should be disclosed upon request in accordance with the principle of public access to official records. Data protection legislation means additional responsibility for the higher education institution in the handling of research data containing personal data.  \\n\\nResearch data collected at Mid Sweden University belongs, as a general rule, to the university and the university therefore has the principal responsibility for data.  \\n\\nThere may be exceptions to the university´s property rights as a result of copyright rules. A document containing data relating to a work protected by copyright may nevertheless be subject to archiving liability, while at the same time subject to copyright protection. The university must consider copyright when applicable.  \\n\\n## Research data and results  \\n\\nThe Swedish “lärarundantaget” means that patentable inventions produced by university teachers are owned by the inventor. In addition, there are so-called “upphovsrättsliga lärarundantag”, which means that the teacher has the copyright in works produced in the service, such as publications and educational material. Mid Sweden University does not claim patent rights or any other intellectual property rights relating to the results of the research. The researcher is not expected to make research data available until the results of the research are published.  \\n\\nWhat is considered to be research data and research results should in most cases be clear. If questions arise regarding the demarcation between research data and research results, these issues should be addressed in consultation with Mid Sweden University’s support function DAU (Data Access Unit).  \\n\\n### Making research data accessible according to FAIR  \\n\\nIn what degree research data can be made open access or not is a case-bycase assessment. The assessment may be influenced by provisions in law and by research ethical considerations and carried out in consultation with the DAU function. Such an assessment is made before data have been collected and should be documented in a data management plan for each project.  \\n\\nA funder may require that research data be published openly available to grant applications for research funding, a funder may also have requested that data be treated confidentially. If such an agreement exists, data cannot be made open until any time embargo has expired. Such an agreement does not necessarily affect the possibility for someone to request data based on the principle of public access. In order to deny disclosure of a document or part of a document (data) upon request, the information must be protected by secrecy according in the Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act (SFS 2009:400).  \\n\\nData can be made accessible to varying degrees and still considered to be handled according to the FAIR principles. When data is confidential under the Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act, only metadata can be made available during the period of confidentiality. In other projects, aggregated data may be published openly, while raw data may only be released upon request. There are also projects where all data can and should be open access. It is possible to choose between different levels of accessibility for sharing data. The researcher, in consultation with the project leader, is responsible together with the DAU to indicate the appropriate level. Some examples of reasons why research data cannot be made open access are that it contains personal data, is subject to confidentiality under the Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act, is security protected or that there are ethical aspects that prevent open access to data.  \\n\\n## Scientific Ethical Consents  \\n\\nWhen research data consists of data from persons participating in a research study, the individuals have normally given their consent for participation in the research. This consent is in some cases limited to the individual research study. Such limited consent constitutes an obstacle to open sharing. If the research participant has consented to the use of research data in other research, it may be made open provided that it does not contain confidential information. Such data may, for example, be sensitive personal data.  \\n\\n### Research data as a public document  \\n\\nResearch data within the University’s activities is archived and can then be requested by everyone as a public document. The right of access to official documents is restricted by secrecy. It is therefore the secrecy rules that limit what can be kept confidential if someone requests access to stored research data. The question whether or not to make research data open access is relevant for dissemination and re-use, but it does not affect the question whether research data is public or confidential.  \\n\\n## Information security  \\n\\nInformation security is about protecting information from various types of threats, such as transparency from unauthorised persons or distortion of information. In accordance with the FAIR principles, research data shall be as open as possible but as closed as necessary while protecting all data from leaking, distorting or destroying. A security system for data protection consists of three different parts: a technical, a physical and an organizational. The three parts shall complement each other and create a secure system.  \\n\\nResearch data shall be handled in such a way as to ensure that the information is protected against unauthorised access (confidentiality), inaccurate changes (property), and that the information is accessible when needed (accessibility). It is also important to ensure that the information is not altered, sought, or disclosed to anyone who is not authorised to consult it.  \\n\\nInformation classification is an important part of achieving good information security for your research data. The information classification is crucial for which storage space can be used for the management of research data. At Mid Sweden University there are guidelines for how information classification should be done, see Modell för klassificering av information DNR: MIUN 2020/2488.  \\n\\n### Preservation and deletion of research data  \\n\\nResearch data shall be preserved and archived for as long as possible, but in some cases, it may be allowed to delete data earlier. Current information and valid deletion decisions can be found on Mid Sweden University’s web.  \\n\\n### Support function — DAU  \\n\\nMid Sweden University has a support function called DAU (Data Access Unit) consisting of representatives from central parts of the administration. This function shall support and consult the university’s researchers in research data management, data management plans and open data. The support function can provide advice and recommendations on issues such as metadata registration, law, archiving, storage, and technical solutions. The DAU function is part of a national network where the majority of Swedish higher education institutions are under the direction of SND (Swedish National Data Service). The University Library has a coordinating and delegating role at Mid Sweden University. The support function can be reached at the following address: researchdata@miun.se',\n",
       " '# Academic Policy Statement APs 27:  \\n\\n# Research Data Management  \\n\\n## 1. Introduction  \\n\\nMiddlesex University is committed to supporting and facilitating research excellence. Excellent research is underpinned by high quality data and as such it is essential that research conducted within the institution be subject to Research Data Management (RDM) best practice. Supporting the principles of the Universities UK concordat to support research integrity\\' and the Middlesex University Code of Practice for Research,? it is the institution\\'s responsibility to encourage and enable researchers to engage with this best practice.  \\n\\nThe benefits of managing research data effectively include:  \\n\\nImproving the integrity, longevity and utility of research data   \\nMitigating the risk of accidental data loss   \\nEnabling data sharing and re-use, increasing the visibility, impact and integrity of research.   \\nMitigating the risk of inappropriate release of sensitive data.   \\nEnsuring appropriate long term preservation of and access to data.  \\n\\nResearch Councils UK (RcUK) expect that \"publicly funded research data are a public good, produced in the public interest, which should be made openly available with as few restrictions as possible in a timely and responsible manner that does not harm intellectual property [while recognising] that there are legal, ethical and commercial constraints on release of research data.\"3  \\n\\nIndividual funding councils such as Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPsRc)\\' and Economic and Social Research Council (EsRc)\\' have updated research data policy statements to set out responsibilities of both the individual researcher and research institutions. While other funders are not explicit in their expectations there is an implicit  \\n\\n### understanding that researchers cannot meet expectations without support from their institution.  \\n\\n## Definitions  \\n\\nResearch Data Management can be described as \"..an explicit process covering the creation and stewardship of research materials to enable their use for as long as they retain value”6  \\n\\nResearch data can be defined as any digital object created during the course of research (which might include documents, still images, video and audio files, spreadsheets, software, computer code, databases or websites) in addition to physical objects such as sketchbooks, diaries, lab notebooks, portfolios, models or other artefacts. It also includes the documentation of Practice-as-Research.  \\n\\nOpen Data is that which \"..can be freely used, modified, and shared by anyone for any purpose.”7  \\n\\nResearch data lifecycle can include the planning, creating, using, appraising, depositing, publishing and preservation of research data enabling both discovery and re-use.  \\n\\n### This policy aims to:  \\n\\n1. Raise awareness of RDM best practice and funder requirements and the associated implications for both individual researchers and the University   \\n2. Acknowledge that RDM falls within the remit of a range of stakeholders and that they will need to work together to develop a comprehensive and cohesive RDM infrastructure and support service.   \\n3. Delineate what Middlesex University expects of its researchers and clarify the services that will be provided to assist them.  \\n\\n## 2. Researcher Responsibilities  \\n\\nAs part of best practice, the University expects researchers to manage their data to appropriate standards throughout the research data lifecycle.  \\n\\n2.1 All research proposals will include a Data Management Plan to be submitted with their grant application.  \\n\\n2.2 The senior researcher involved in a research project is ultimately responsible for the management of research data. In the case of research students, the supervisor is responsible.  \\n\\n2.3 Relevant ethics guidelines\\', intellectual property rights (including commercial implications),10 Copyright\\'1, and data protection12 must be considered.  \\n\\n2.4 Appropriate data should be selected to preserve post-project for 10 years unless funder or legal requirements specify otherwise at which point a review process will be triggered.  \\n\\n2.5 Data selected for preservation must be registered in the institutional data catalogue within 12 months along with any associated restrictions and conditions of access. Appropriate metadata records should be included in the catalogue record, this should include reference to any disciplinary standards that have been applied to the data.  \\n\\n2.5 The Dean of School is responsible for decision making about preserved datasets in the absence of a responsible individual.  \\n\\n2.6 Each researcher must make themselves familiar with and adhere to the requirements of their particular funder, publishers and other relevant stakeholders.  \\n\\n2.7 Research data should be made as open as possible unless there are legal, ethical, commercial, intellectual property or other reasons not to do so. An appropriate licence should be applied to manage the re-use of this data.  \\n\\n## 3. Institutional Responsibilities  \\n\\nA programme of guidance and training in all areas of RDM for all relevant stakeholders will be developed by Library & Student Support (Lss) in consultation with all Schools, the Research & Knowledge Transfer Office (RKTO) and the Computing and Communications Systems Service (Ccss) and Staff Development.  \\n\\nThe University will develop infrastructure and support to enable compliance with this policy.  \\n\\n## 4. Policy Implementation and Review  \\n\\nThis policy was approved by Academic Board on Thursday 25 June 2015.

       " '# Newcastle University Research Data Management Policy Principles & Code of Good Practice  \\n\\nThis document outlines the overall policy of the University and its expectations of its staff and key services. More detailed practical help and information can be found on the ‘Research Data oolkit’ website:    \\n\\nolicy Principles 1. The project Principal Investigator (PI) at Newcastle University has overall responsibility for the appropriate storage, treatment (including making data sets suitable for publication) and security of research project data. PIs may delegate discrete responsibilities to other members of the project team and this should be recorded. 2. All research projects are encouraged to create a data management plan at the earliest practical stage of a project. The plan should outline a project’s approach to data, including costs and be reviewed regularly to ensure that practice remains in-line with expected standards. 3. All University staff are responsible for making themselves familiar with and adhering to legislation, funder guidance and University policy governing their research data. 4. The University expects that data (particularly personal data) be protected in line with both external and internal standards and discipline specific practice. The PI has responsibility for ensuring the safeguarding of personal identifiable research data and compliance with all relevant legal requirements. 5. Researchers should deposit all significant archive research data in an appropriate funder mandated or discipline specific data repository. Where this is not available, data should be deposited in an approved centre / manner. 6. Published datasets should be comprehensive and have clear instructions for access, which adheres to data citation principles. Metadata (descriptive information) should be rich enough to facilitate discovery, reproduction and reuse. Personal data should be protected in line with the University’s Ethics Policy and Code of Good Practice. 7. Research data should remain available for 10 years following any publication (unless otherwise specified) after which retention will be reviewed. Metadata will be kept indefinitely. 8. Non-digital data or digital data that underpins a publication should be recorded in the University’s data catalogue as a metadata record. 9. The University undertakes to provide appropriate resources, training, support and guidance to researchers and research support staff around data management and data governance. Where appropriate, the University will also provide a mechanism to record research metadata and to manage access. 10. Where research data has a commercial value or supports a commercial output such as a patent then public disclosure of the data may be delayed (this should be agreed in consultation with Research Strategy and Development).  \\n\\n## Code of Good Practice in Research Data Management  \\n\\n### 1. Background & Purpose  \\n\\nThe Policy Principles and Code of Good Practice have been written to guide researchers towards the best practice in the area of research data management. The document brings together guidance from across the institution and is designed as a single point of reference for academic and support staff. A research data management digital toolkit has been created to provide up-to-date links to related policies, funder requirements and best practice guidance. Collectively the policy principles, code of good practice and toolkit aim to:  \\n\\nsupport good research data management practice   \\nensure that data is handled appropriately   \\nmaximise impact of open data by encouraging discoverability and reuse   \\nensure compliance with legislation and funder polices   \\nprotect sensitive / personally identifiable data   \\nprotect intellectual property and commercialisation opportunities  \\n\\nThe document sets out the best practice standards the institution expects of projects which it sponsors or which are undertaken in its name. It does not replace or override guidance from research funders; it should instead be considered as a complementary resource. If there are multiple guidelines then the most rigorous advice should be followed and / or advice sought from the Research Data Service (RDS).  \\n\\n### 2. Scope  \\n\\nThe Policy and Code of Good Practice covers all funded research projects undertaken by Newcastle University staff and postgraduate researchers. The policy applies to all data (including active and archive data) regardless of format and relates to projects active at / from the time of policy approval.  \\n\\nThe University acknowledges that a full implementation of this policy will be a long-term process.  \\n\\n### 3. Responsible Personnel / Bodies  \\n\\nResearch Active Staff, Research Active Postgraduates, Research Data Service, Research Strategy and Development (including Legal & Joint Research Office), Library, IT Service, Head of Academic Units, University Research Committee, PIs, and Project Team Members.  \\n\\n#### 3.1. Overall  \\n\\nUniversity Research Committee (URC) has overall responsibility for the institution’s research data strategy, its implementation and support. URC devolves responsibility for individual research projects to the project PI; however it recognises that for the PI to effectively perform their responsibilities they must be supported by other academic staff, academic units and the central services.  \\n\\nResponsibility for the implementation, operation and support of the policy as well as compliance to it is devolved to the Research Data Service (RDS). The RDS is also responsible for reviewing the policy and ensuring it remains suitable for the requirements of the institution, funders and data providers.  \\n\\n#### 3.2. Principal Investigators  \\n\\nPractical and operational responsibility for research data throughout the lifecycle of the project is in the hands of the project PI at Newcastle. Their key responsibilities are:  \\n\\nensuring data collection, storage, processing and dissemination are in line with legal and funder requirements   \\nensuring project research data management maps to best practice in their research field   \\ndelegating responsibility for research data management to other members of the project team e.g. to co-investigators or project administrators   \\nensuring that the team / individual is competent (i.e. aware of their data management responsibilities and able to discharge them) and noting this in project documentation having in place a data management plan or appropriate project documents   \\nnotifying the University of the location of and instructions on how to access archived research data   \\nincluding appropriate data access citations within their publications   \\nensuring that data, should it be requested, is in an appropriate format e.g.   \\nanonymised and accessible  \\n\\nShould the Principal Investigator leave the University or no longer be able to continue in the role of being responsible for the project’s data, a replacement should be appointed within the department/ research group.  \\n\\nIn the case of student projects, the PI is the academic supervisor rather than the student themselves. The academic supervisor’s is responsible for active data i.e. whilst the student is enrolled and archive data i.e. once the student has left.  \\n\\n#### 3.3. Other Project Team Members  \\n\\nAre responsible for:  \\n\\ndischarging their responsibilities as delegated by the PI and detailed in the project   \\ndocumentation   \\nproactively supporting the PI with data management practice and raising any   \\nconcerns to the PI in a timely manner  \\n\\n#### 3.4. Research Data Service (RDS)  \\n\\nThe Research Data Service (RDS) was established to provide support to researchers in managing their data and meeting the requirements of the University, funders and data providers. The RDS is a four-way partnership between the Library, Research Strategy and Development, University IT Service (NUIT), and Faculties.  \\n\\nAre responsible for:  \\n\\nproviding the guidance and support necessary to facilitate good practice in research   \\ndata management   \\nproviding advice and guidance on funder requirements   \\nprovision of guidance regarding data security   \\nthe provision of appropriate storage, back-up and where relevant the archiving of   \\nproject data   \\nadvising on the long term curation of research data outputs   \\nthe technical support of the research information management systems   \\nproviding guidance on the categorisation and classification of research output   \\nmetadata (i.e. descriptive information relating to the data)   \\nco-ordinating the necessary training to enable faculties and academics to discharge   \\ntheir responsibilities   \\nadvising on commercialisation   \\nacting as gatekeeper for any data access requests to University held data  \\n\\n#### 3.5. Research Directors / Unit Managers  \\n\\nAre responsible for:  \\n\\nthe promulgation of the policy principles and code of good practice   \\nensuring adherence to the policy principles in their unit   \\nwhere necessary establishing supplementary discipline specific guidance   \\nfeeding information on researcher development and support requirements to   \\nResearch Strategy and Development  \\n\\n### 4. Ownership of Data  \\n\\nResearch data may have significant ethical, confidentiality, intellectual property, funder and legal restrictions attached to it and therefore ownership of the data should be established as early as possible. An appropriate agreement should be in place before the project starts. The Research Data Service will be able to advise and, where necessary, negotiate with funders on behalf of PIs.  \\n\\nUnless explicitly agreed the University owns the intellectual property rights, including copyright, to the research data created by researchers during the term of their employment with the University. Where research is externally funded this may create additional obligations and this should be taken into account.  \\n\\nPostgraduate research students will ordinarily own the intellectual property rights, including copyright, to the research data created during their studies. Exceptions exist where they are working on a funded project – please see the Research Student Confidentiality and IP Policy for further clarification. Nevertheless as the research sponsor the University requires that research students follow this policy, including the good data management and reuse aspects.  \\n\\n### 5. Use of Third Party Data  \\n\\nWhere research involves usage of third party data, any terms and conditions associated with the data should be carefully scrutinised for potential copyright and / or licensing issues. These may have an impact on what data can be used for in the future. It is also important to ensure the data does not have any ethical restrictions associated with it e.g. it relates to nonanonymised personal identifiable data as this may affect the conditions of reuse.  \\n\\n### 6. Third Party Usage of University Data  \\n\\nAny data released for reuse should have a licence associated with its usage. This licence will ensure (at minimum) that the University and Academic Creator(s) are attributed in any reuse of the data. The University will provide standard agreements which should be signed before data is shared. Access will be arranged through the Research Data Service.  \\n\\nOnce data has been made available to the public, it should be noted that the data will then be available for further reuse. Therefore, the PI should ensure that the data is released at an appropriate point i.e. when opportunities for commercialisation and publication have been explored.  \\n\\n### 7. Sharing Data with Project Partners  \\n\\nA clear agreement regarding research data management and sharing should be put in place before any project start date. Special care should be taken where the project involves organisations outside the European Economic Area which may be governed by less robust legal frameworks and present a greater risk of unintended dissemination. Likewise when working with commercial organisations the increased intellectual property considerations should be taken into account when agreeing data sharing and publication. Research Strategy and Development will be able to assist in drawing up an appropriate agreement.  \\n\\nDetails of data sharing; type, frequency, format and transfer arrangements should be noted within your data management plan and agreed at the project outset.  \\n\\nLinks to Legal and Grants & Contracts  \\n\\n### 8. Commercialisation  \\n\\nWhere research data has, or may have, commercial value, Research Strategy and Development should be consulted at the earliest possible stage. They will assist in assessing the value of the data, provide advice on the exploitation of any opportunities and whether publication of the data should be delayed or access restricted.  \\n\\nLink to Research Strategy and Development Policies and Enterprise Teams  \\n\\n### 9. Active Storage & Data Security  \\n\\nEach project should create and maintain a data management plan that details all key information on the project. For advice on this please see the additional resources.  \\n\\nGiven the faculty based structure of the University, academic units are responsible for ensuring staff are aware of available options and use storage facilities that provide the required standards for their data. The Research Data Service will provide this information to the faculties.  \\n\\nFunded projects receive a data allowance of 0.5TB. Where project data needs are greater than this figure and funder requirements allow, additional resource should be costed into the project at the grant application stage.  \\n\\nFor requirements outside of this please consult the Research Data Service (RDS) or the Institute IT Support Officer.  \\n\\n#### 9.1. Digital Research Data  \\n\\nWherever possible and appropriate data should be stored in digital format using approved storage systems. Data should be stored in a secure location, in a robust format, backed up  \\n\\nregularly and access to data should be controlled to protect against theft, misuse, damage or loss. Data should be stored according to best practice in the relevant field of research.  \\n\\nThe IT Service provides a secure storage service; of which all staff receive a basic allowance and more can be requested although this may incur an additional cost. The IT Service can also provide guidance and advice on other external providers of data storage.  \\n\\nFor information and guidance on the storage of digital data please see the IT Service (NUIT) and Governance web pages.  \\n\\n#### 9.2. Non-digital Research Data  \\n\\nWherever possible and appropriate non-digital research data should be digitised. If they cannot be digitised they should be stored securely in line with discipline best practice and digital metadata (information of data location and access conditions) provided at publication / project end.  \\n\\n### 10. Storage at Project End / Data Retention  \\n\\nThe University mandates that the project data underpinning publications and data with acknowledged long-term value should remain accessible, and where appropriate discoverable, for at least 10 years.  \\n\\n#### 10.1. Archiving  \\n\\nThe responsibility for the archiving of the data lies with the PI and there are numerous national and data specific repositories. The PI should check that the sharing of the data is permissible and appropriate in light of confidentiality, ethical and legal concerns before depositing any data into a repository and making the data openly available.  \\n\\n#### 10.2 Registration of Archived Data with the University  \\n\\nThe University requires that the location of the data underpinning any publication be made available to the RDS (on request) if the funder requires or if the data is identified as being reusable.  \\n\\n### 11. Deletion  \\n\\nThe University requires that the data is kept 10 years from the last date of access. After this point the data will be reviewed and either retained or destroyed. Any destruction will be in accordance with legal and funder requirements.  \\n\\n### 12.  Breach(es)  \\n\\nWhere a breach of this Policy and Code of Good Practice results in the unauthorised release of identifiable personal information into the public domain or non-compliance with external funder or regulatory requirements, this should be reported to the Research Data Service at the earliest possible time. If you are unsure whether a breach should be reported please contact the relevant Faculty Dean of Research Innovation.  \\n\\nThe Research Data Service will then work with the Principle Investigator and project team to minimise any potential damage and to ensure that all relevant parties including participants, data providers and funders are appropriately advised.  \\n\\n## Additional Resources  \\n\\nThere are additional resources which support this document within the research data toolkit, these include:  \\n\\nRelevant Policies   \\nPlanning guidance and examples of data management plans   \\nData storage and security   \\nPreservation and sharing guidance   \\nTraining events and resources   \\nList of recommended repositories and storage providers   \\nFunder terms and conditions   \\nInformation Governance Toolkit   \\nContact details for relevant support  \\n\\n## Appendix A  \\n\\n### Security-sensitive Research Material  \\n\\nSecurity-sensitive materials in this case can be defined as:- a) Those which are covered by the Official Secrets Act (1989) and the Terrorism Act 2006. b) Materials which could be considered ‘extremist’ or incompatible with British values.  \\n\\nThe University supports both its academic faculty and student body in undertaking research utilising security sensitive materials but takes seriously its responsibility to protect them both from the potentially radicalising effects of viewing materials of this type and of misinterpretation of intent by authorities (which may result in legal sanction).  \\n\\nTo ensure the University is able to protect its researchers it must be aware of the research before it begins. Early notification is through the ethical review process; it is from this that the institution is able to ensure proper data governance and oversight.  \\n\\n### Ethical Review  \\n\\nThe University is clear that research involving the access, collection and use of securitysensitive materials carries a risk to researchers as well as the general public and therefore any such research should go through full ethical review.  \\n\\nThe University operates a two stage ethical review process for all its research. Within the preliminary stage, section six relates to data. The researcher should answer ‘Yes’ to the question.  \\n\\n1. Does the research involve the viewing, usage or transfer of Sensitive personal data as defined as by the Data Protection Act 1998, Terrorism Act (2006) or data governed by statute such as the Official Secrets Act, commercial contract or by convention e.g. client confidentiality? (If you are unsure please tick ‘Yes’ and complete the sub-questions).  \\n\\nThen answer ‘Yes’ to the relevant sub-question(s).  \\n\\nThe researcher will then be directed to the full ethical review form where they will be asked to provide additional information on the types of data being used and materials accessed.  \\n\\n### Data Governance  \\n\\nThe downloading of (particularly terrorism related) security-sensitive materials and visiting of security-sensitive websites can be seen by the authorities as prosecutable offences should the intent behind them be illegal.  \\n\\nResearch material which is security sensitive should not be kept on the researcher’s personal computer or on their standard University drive. Before beginning the research, a member of NUITs Information Security Team should be contacted, they will arrange for the set-up of an appropriately secure project drive. Material within this drive will be easy to access but in some cases there will may restrictions preventing its exchange.  \\n\\nLikewise if the research involves visiting security-sensitive websites, the researcher should be aware that many of these sites are under surveillance by the authorities. It is strongly recommended that their University profile (IP address) is used to access these sites, thereby ensuring that their activities are flagged as being a legitimate part of their research and ensure that enquiries come to the institution in the first instance.  \\n\\nPhysical data, e.g. manuals / reports should be scanned and a copy uploaded to the secure project file store.  \\n\\nBy using a secure file store (along with appropriate ethics approval) the researcher will ensure that, should the University be asked, it can confirm that the materials within it are for research. Please be aware that in order to effectively answer any queries from the security services the Research Strategy and Development will be able to access metadata on the files e.g. titles and date of creation within the secure project drive. It will not however be able to access the content.  \\n\\n### Oversight  \\n\\nThe university also has a responsibility to ensure that researchers are not adversely affected (emotionally and intellectually) by the research they undertake. If there are any concerns these should be raised as soon as possible.  \\n\\nStudent projects: In the first instance it is the project supervisor’s responsibility to ensure that the students are not adversely affected. Supervisors should be prepared to liaise closely with the student’s personal tutor and student welfare.  \\n\\nStaff projects: The Head of Unit will handle any concerns in consultation with Human Resources.  \\n\\n### External Queries  \\n\\nAny queries from legitimate bodies e.g. the police or security services will be handled by the Research Strategy and Development in conjunction with the Information Security Team. If an individual receives an inquiry from the Police then the University’s Research Strategy and Development tram should be advised of this.  \\n\\nThe email contact for this and any other enquiries is res.policy@ncl.ac.uk',\n",
       " '# Research Data Management Policy  \\n\\n## 1 Introduction/Context  \\n\\nThe effective management of research data is becoming increasingly important.  UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) has affirmed that making research data available to users is a core part of its remit.  UKRI’s Common Principles on Data Policy1 states that ‘Publicly funded research data are a public good, produced in the public interest, which should be made openly available with as few restrictions as possible in a timely and responsible manner that does not harm intellectual property.’  \\n\\nNorthumbria University recognises that data from its research should be wellmanaged to benefit the researcher, the University and the wider community.  As such, there is an obligation to record, store and archive research data appropriately, in a way that is proportionate in terms of security and retention, and allows for sharing of data to contribute to the impact of the research.  It is recognised that types of data used, collected and generated will vary between different disciplines. The approach taken in this policy is to be sensitive to these differences while ensuring that good practice is promoted and funder requirements are met.  \\n\\nThis policy should be read in conjunction with other University policies, notably the Records Management Policy2, the Research Ethics and Governance Handbook3, and the Data Protection Policy4.  \\n\\n## 2 Scope  \\n\\nThe policy applies to all research conducted by staff and postgraduate research students at the University, regardless of whether it is funded or unfunded.  The policy does not normally apply to activities such as surveys used to improve service provision, conducted by Students’ Union or Service Departments, or to undergraduate work, unless it is included in scholarly publications.  \\n\\n### 3 Definition of Research  \\n\\nResearch in the context of this policy is based on the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) Research Excellence Framework (REF) 2014 definition, contained in Annex C of the ‘Assessment Framework and Guidance on Submissions’5, which defines research as ‘a process of investigation leading to new insights, effectively shared.’  It includes work of direct relevance to the needs of commerce, industry, and to the public and voluntary sectors; scholarship; the invention and generation of ideas, images, performances, artefacts including design, where these lead to new or substantially improved insights; and the use of existing knowledge in experimental development to produce new or substantially improved materials, devices, products and processes, including design and construction. It excludes routine testing and routine analysis of materials, components and processes such as for the maintenance of national standards, as distinct from the development of new analytical techniques. It also excludes the development of teaching materials that do not embody original research.  \\n\\n### 4 Definition of Research Data  \\n\\nFor the purposes of this policy, research data refers to any material collected, observed or created for the purpose of analysis and on which research conclusions are based.  Research data may be numerical, descriptive or visual, and can be digital, paper-based or in other forms.  \\n\\n### 5 Definition of Researcher  \\n\\nFor the purposes of this policy, researchers are defined as members of the University, including all staff and postgraduate research (PGR) students, and those conducting research on University premises or using University facilities.  \\n\\nThe policy excludes Postgraduate Taught and Undergraduate students, unless their research findings are included in scholarly publications.  \\n\\n## 6 Governance  \\n\\ni) The policy is approved by Research and Knowledge Exchange Committee, and monitored through the Research Data Management Working Group. ii) The policy will be reviewed annually.  \\n\\n## 7 Principles  \\n\\nThe principles which underpin the use and management of research data by University staff and students are set out below. These principles are consistent with the principles of data protection set out in Article 5 of the General Data Protection Regulation6 and satisfy the requirements in Schedule 1, Part 4, 39 of the UK Data Protection Act 2018:  \\n\\ni) Research data will be managed throughout the research data lifecycle7 in accordance with the University’s policies, guidelines and standards, and funder, legislative and ethical requirements.   \\nii) Research data shall in most cases be collected for the purposes of creating new knowledge which is shared with others through publication and dissemination. In these cases, research is normally deemed to be ‘a task in the public interest’ (principles of lawfulness and purpose limitation Art.6 GDPR). In cases where special category data are being processed, then an additional condition will apply. For most research carried out by the University  \\n\\nthis will normally be that processing is necessary for ‘scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes’ (GDPR Art.9).  \\n\\niii) Data management plans should be written for all new research projects, regardless of whether submission of such plans is required when applying for research funding.  The plan must address how the data will be captured, managed, stored, retained, shared, published, and how any confidentiality and data protection issues will be addressed.8 See also Section 10 for further guidance on data management plans.  \\n\\niv) Personally identifiable data should be anonymised or pseudonymised where possible as soon after collection as possible. Where researchers can undertake some or all of their research activities without using identifiable personal data, they should make arrangements to do so (principle of data minimisation). Where research requires the processing of personal data, and where the University is the data controller, then there must be a clear legal basis for processing and this must be communicated to the data subject (principle of lawfulness, fairness and transparency).9  \\n\\nv) Where personal data are stored and processed for research purposes by University staff this must be carried out in accordance with the University’s information security policy (principle of integrity and confidentiality).10  \\n\\nvi) Data should be made available for access and re-use where legally, ethically and commercially appropriate.  \\n\\nvii) Researchers must provide sufficient metadata and explanatory documentation about their research data to ensure that data are discoverable, understandable and re-useable.  Such metadata will be published by the University, normally within 12 months of the data being generated.  If access to data is restricted, the metadata should outline the reasons for this and the conditions which need to be met for access to be granted.  \\n\\nviii) Data must be retained in an appropriate format for a period of at least 1 year from the end of the project for low risk projects, 3 years for moderate risk projects and 7 years for high risk projects, in accordance with the University’s Research Records Retention Schedule (principle of storage limitation)11, unless other funder regulations apply (for example, EPSRC stipulates a retention period of 10 years, plus an additional 10 from the last date at which access to the data was requested by a third party).  Where possible and applicable, research data that are not in a digital format will be digitised to facilitate access.  \\n\\nix) Where possible, or if mandated by the funder, retained data must be submitted to an appropriate archive or database for long-term preservation.  \\n\\nResearchers should avoid retaining data using methods that might not persist for 10 years, such as project websites.  \\n\\nx) All data which are created as part of research at Northumbria University must be registered with the University, even if the data are hosted elsewhere.  All reasonable steps must be taken to ensure that research data are not stored in a jurisdiction that offers lower levels of protection than are available in the UK.  \\n\\nxi) Published papers should include a statement describing how, and on what terms, supporting research data may be accessed.  \\n\\n## 8 Data Management Responsibilities  \\n\\ni) The most senior Northumbria researcher associated with a research project (whether funded or unfunded) is the Data Lead for that project and is ultimately responsible and accountable for research data management within that project.  \\n\\nii) For funded projects, the Data Lead will normally be the Principal Investigator.  \\n\\niii) For Postgraduate Research Students, the Data Lead will normally be the Principal Supervisor.  \\n\\niv) The Data Lead is responsible for ensuring that all research staff and students working on a project are aware of the University’s data management policy and supporting guidelines and procedures, and for reviewing data management plans annually.  The Data Lead may assign specific data management responsibilities to other researchers on a project.  \\n\\nv) In the absence of the Data Lead, responsibility for research data management devolves to the department Research and Innovation Lead.  \\n\\nvi) Stakeholders and Services across the University will work together to create a robust infrastructure for the research data lifecycle.  \\n\\n## 9 Implementation and Communication  \\n\\ni) The University will provide training, support, advice and guidance regarding research data management through the researcher development training programme (including the PGR training programme) and web-based guidance.  \\n\\nii) The University will provide mechanisms and services for storage, backup, registration and retention of research data during a research project and after its completion.  \\n\\n## 10 Further Guidance  \\n\\nThe University Library has published comprehensive guidance on research data management:    \\n\\nFurther guidance on producing Data Management Plans is available through the Digital Curation Centre:  \\n\\n   \\n\\nInformation on RCUK individual funder policies is available through:    \\n\\nApproved by Research and Knowledge Exchange Committee by Chair’s action on 29th October 2018.  In light of the changing landscape around RDM the Policy is subject to annual review.',\n",

DEFINITIONS  \\n\\nIn this Policy, unless otherwise indicated:  \\n\\n1.1. “Principal Investigator (PI)” means the Nottingham Trent University (NTU) employee primarily tasked with delivering a programme of research on behalf of NTU, whether or not he/she is referred to as such in a research grant.  \\n\\n1.2. “Researcher” means any person undertaking research or involved in collecting, generating or creating Research Data, for or on behalf of NTU which shall include but not be limited to employees, workers, visiting researchers, postgraduate research students and the PI.  \\n\\n1.3. “Research Data” means information in digital, computer-readable format or paper-based that:  \\n\\n1.3.1. is contained or presented in various ways including notes, facts, figures, tables, images (still and moving), audio or visual recordings; and  \\n\\n1.3.2. is collected, generated or obtained during the course of or as a result of undertaking research (which includes but is not limited to conducting field or laboratory experiments, conducting trials, surveys, interviews, focus groups or analysis of data); and  \\n\\n1.3.3. is subsequently used by the Researcher as a basis for making calculations or drawing conclusions to develop, support or revise theories, practices and findings.  \\n\\n1.4. “Repository” means the repository or repositories which NTU owns or controls and makes available to Researchers for the storage of Research Data.  \\n\\n1.5. “Access” means methods, tools, software and devices to access the stored Research Data.  \\n\\n# 2 IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINES  \\n\\nThe Senior Management Team and University Research Committee of NTU have approved this Policy on Research Data Management. It is acknowledged that complete implementation of this Policy by all researchers will need to be phased. The timing of this phasing will be determined by the mandated requirements of external funders of research activities at NTU.  \\n\\n# 3 UNIVERSITY POLICY  \\n\\n3.1 Research data will be managed to the highest standards throughout the research data lifecycle as part of the NTU’s commitment to research excellence.   \\n3.2 Responsibility for research data management through a sound research data management plan during any research project or programme lies primarily with the Principal Investigators (PIs).  \\n\\n3.3 All new research proposals, from 30 June 2014, must include research data management plans or protocols that explicitly address data capture, management, integrity, confidentiality, retention, access, sharing and publication.  \\n\\n3.3.1 A data plan should be made for each proposed research project or funding application.   \\n3.3.2 Sufficient metadata should be created and stored to assist with discovery and reuse.   \\n3.3.3 The data plan should comply with relevant legislative frameworks such as (but not limited to) data protection, intellectual property, ethics and human rights.   \\n3.3.4 The data plan should evolve and be version controlled as the project develops.   \\n3.3.5 The final data plan should be retained within NTU alongside the project data outputs (in accordance with the Retention Policy).  \\n\\n3.4 NTU will provide training, support, advice and where appropriate guidelines and templates for research data management and research data management plans.  \\n\\n3.4.1 NTU will provide mechanisms and services for storage, backup, registration, deposit, retention and access of research data assets in support of current and future access, during and after completion of research projects. This includes tools to ensure the stored Research Data is discoverable and accessible. Once a project has closed, the Research Data should be offered and assessed for preservation in NTU supported repository.   \\n3.4.2 On project completion, the Principal Investigator is responsible for data transformation or format conversion required to archive and access the Research Data.   \\n3.4.3 On project completion, the Principal Investigator should ensure all relevant Research Data is made available in the location specified in the data management plan.  \\n\\n3.5 Any Research Data which is to be retained elsewhere, for example in an international data service or domain repository should be registered with NTU. The registration must include the retention and access policy of the relevant data service to help determine compliance with this Policy.  \\n\\n3.6 Principal Investigators are responsible for ensuring that any external Research Data to be incorporated into their research is registered with NTU. The registration must include the retention and access policy governing the Research Data to help determine compliance with this Policy.  \\n\\n3.7 Research data management plans must ensure that research Data are available for access and re-use where appropriate and under appropriate safeguards.  \\n\\n3.8 Principal Investigators are responsible for deciding, subject to legal, ethical and commercial constraints, which Research Data are to be released to meet their obligations. Research Data shall be released for access and re-use as soon as practicable after research activity is completed and results published.  \\n\\n3.9 The privacy and other legitimate interests of the subjects of Research Data must be protected.  \\n\\n3.10 Research Data of future historical interest, and all Research Data that represent records of NTU, including data that substantiate research findings, will be offered and assessed for deposit and retention in an appropriate national or international data service or domain repository, or an NTU repository.  \\n\\n3.11 As a basic principle NTU should retain the right to use its Research Data and outputs for its own teaching and non-commercial research purposes.  Exclusive rights to reuse or publish Research Data should not be granted to commercial publishers or agents without retaining the rights to make the data openly available for re-use. Where the granting of such exclusive rights is a requirement of the funder, advice should be sought from NTU’S Legal Services Team to ensure that NTU can comply with its obligations under charity law.  \\n\\n3.12 If Research Data is to be deleted or destroyed, either because the agreed retention period has expired or for legal or ethical reasons, this should be done so in accordance with all legal, ethical, research funder and collaborator requirements with particular attention to confidentiality and security.  \\n\\nNTU has a range of policy documents and guidance which offers advice and sets out the regulations pertaining to a number of areas, some of which may impact on the Research Data Management Policy:  \\n\\nCode of Practice for Research Professional Standards in research Legal Agreements and Intellectual Property IT Security policy Staff Disciplinary Procedures  \\n\\n# 5 DOCUMENT GOVERNANCE  \\n\\n5.1 Responsibilities  \\n\\nPolicy Owner Pro-Vice Chancellor for Research  \\n\\n5.2 Version Control and Change History  \\n\\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Version</td><td>ApprovalDate</td><td>Approved By</td><td>Amendment</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>30/06/2014 26/03/2015</td><td>SeniorManagement tTeam University</td><td>NewPolicy</td></tr><tr><td>1.1</td><td></td><td>ResearchCommittee</td><td>3.3.Additionofdateof adoption. 4. \"ResearchEthics Policy” updated to “Code of Practice for Research\" 5.3.

This includes staff and students, and those who are conducting research on behalf of the University.  \\n\\nThe Policy does not apply to taught Postgraduate and undergraduate students, except where their research is included in published outputs.  \\n\\n# 3 Policy  \\n\\nThe University recognises research data as a valuable institutional asset, and the important role of research data management in underpinning research excellence and integrity.  \\n\\nTo this end, the University endorses the RCUK Common Principles on Data and the UK Research and Innovation Common, UKRI, principles on data policy.  \\n\\nResearch data will be managed in line with funder requirements as well as University policy and other relevant regulations and legislation.  \\n\\nResearch data must be:  \\n\\nAccurate, complete, authentic and reliable.   \\nIdentifiable, retrievable, and available, with as few restrictions as possible in a timely and responsible manner.   \\nKept in a manner that is compliant with legal obligations, University policy and, where applicable, the requirements of funding bodies.   \\nWhere necessary, adhere to NHS and NIHR data guidelines as a minimum  \\n\\n## 4 Data Management Plans  \\n\\nClear arrangements for data management must be in place from the outset of the research project through the preparation of a Data Management Plan.  \\n\\nData Management plans must be prepared according to funders’ requirements, or elsewhere directed.  \\n\\nHeads of Research have overall responsibility for the effective management of research data generated within or obtained during research activities research, including by their research groups.  However, it is expected that in most cases the PI of a project will be responsible for developing a DMP.  \\n\\nAll new Data Management Plans should include processes for:  \\n\\nData capture,   \\nManagement,   \\nIntegrity,   \\nConfidentiality,   \\nRetention,   \\nSharing and publication.  \\n\\nAssistance with preparing Data Management Plans and templates can be sought from the PI or found at:  \\n\\n### DMP Online  \\n\\n## 5 Responsibilities  \\n\\n### 5.1 Principal Investigators (PI)  \\n\\nAssume primary responsibility for ensuring that data management activities comply with the requirements of this policy and with any relevant funders’ policies.  \\n\\nIt is their responsibility to ensure that all members of the research team with access to the research data adhere to good research data management practice  \\n\\n### 5.2 Researchers  \\n\\nFamiliarise themselves with the requirements of this policy and with those of any funder(s) thereby assisting the PI to ensure that all data management activities are fully compliant.  \\n\\nUndertake any data management training provided by the University and ensure that they are aware of the guidance and support available.  \\n\\n### 5.3 The University  \\n\\nEnsure that appropriate training, support and advice is available to enable researchers to comply with this policy.  \\n\\nProvide secure and backed-up storage for data during projects and provide advice on the most appropriate repository for long-term storage of completed and/or published datasets.  \\n\\nFurther develop services that will support data management planning and decision making on issues related to data curation and retention, disposal and open access, in partnership with the research community.  \\n\\n### 5.4 Research Data Management Working Group, RDMWG  \\n\\nThe RDMWG will provide appropriate oversight and support for RDM principles and review and maintain any documentation relating to Research Data Management.  \\n\\n### 5.5 Research Strategy Committee, RSC  \\n\\nThe RSC will provide overall guidance and support on all aspects of research activity within QMU  \\n\\n## 6 Personally Identifiable Data, PID  \\n\\n6.1 Data containing personal information, PID, must be managed in accordance with the requirements of GDPR legislation.   Guidance on this can be obtained from the University Data Protection Officer.   \\n6.2 PID should not be stored on external services, other than your QMU OneDrive account, except in exceptional circumstances and should be moved to a secure device as early as possible.  See further below.   \\n6.3 PID should not be transferred via insecure channels, such as email.   \\n6.4 PID should be stored no longer than necessary.   \\n6.5 Only anonymised PID may be included in an open access dataset.   \\n6.6 Data generated via online testing platforms must be transferred onto the approved data platform as defined in the DMP as soon as the data file has been processed.   \\n6.7 Consent forms must not be stored with data where they could compromise anonymisation.   \\n6.8 Non-Digital PID must be stored in a secure location, such as a lockable cabinet.   \\n6.9 If network drives cannot be used due to e.g., lack of network coverage, PID can be temporarily transferred to a University provided encrypted USB drive.  \\n\\n6.10 PID placed on temporary storage must be transferred back onto the network or OneDrive as soon as the requirement for temporary storage has ended.  \\n\\n### Data Management Principles  \\n\\nResearch data must be retained and disposed of securely according to the relevant retention and disposal schedule.  This can be found at:  \\n\\nRecords Retention Policy  \\n\\n7.2 Research data that underpins published results or is considered to have long-term value should be retained.  The default period for research data retention is 10 years from date of last requested access. However, retention periods should, as a minimum, conform to the requirements of a funding agency or body.  \\n\\n7.3 Retained data must be deposited in an appropriate data service, or as mandated by the funder or otherwise directed.  \\n\\nA statement describing how and on what terms any supporting data may be accessed must be included in research outputs.  \\n\\n7.5 Where research is undertaken in partnership or under contract with a third party, a collaboration agreement must be signed before the start of the research that clearly addresses data ownership and partner responsibility for data storage.  \\n\\n7.6 Data placed on temporary storage must be transferred back onto the approved storage platform as detailed in the DMP as soon as the requirement for temporary storage has ended.  \\n\\n7.7 Research proposals should consider whether storage requirements may exceed those currently offered by the University.  Any such potential requirement should be discussed in advance of the application with both IT and the RDM Working Group.  \\n\\n7.8 Before staff leave the university, data of long-term value produced using University resources must remain accessible to the University.  Ownership of the data should be transferred to another member of staff on agreement of the Head of Division.  \\n\\n7.9 At the completion of a project, the PI must assess what data are of long-term value, and whether the data can be made openly available in a manner consistent with relevant legal, ethical and regulatory frameworks.  \\n\\n7.10 If research data are to be deleted or destroyed, this should be done in accordance with all legal, ethical and funder requirements and only after the written approval of the Head of Division.  \\n\\n7.11 Retained data suitable for external access should be stored on QMU's institutional data repository, eData unless an alternative is mandated by the funder.  \\n\\nLibrary Services manages QMU's open-access data repository, eData.  It exists to preserve datasets that support research outputs published by QMU researchers, as required by funder or publisher mandates, and to maximise their sharing and reuse.  \\n\\nDatasets shared in eData should be used in accordance with the Terms in the QMU  \\n\\nRepositories Policy.   \\n7.12 After a project, a metadata record describing retained data must be made publicly available within 12 months of the project completion.   \\n7.13 Metadata and documentation about research data should provide sufficient contextual information to enable the data to be discovered, accessed, understood, interpreted and reused by future users.   \\n7.14 If access to the data is restricted, the published metadata should provide the reasons for the restrictions and summarise the conditions that must be satisfied for access to be granted.   \\n7.15 All users of research datasets should acknowledge the sources of their data and abide by the terms and conditions under which they were accessed, in order to recognise the intellectual contributions of research teams and supporting organisations.   \\n7.16 Research data must be managed throughout its lifecycle in compliance with relevant legislation.   \\n7.17 Unless there are ethically and legally justified reasons for doing otherwise, researchers working with human subjects must ensure that they have an auditable record of each study participant’s explicit informed consent. to obtain, hold and use their personal data as per research ethics guidance.   \\n8 Cloud Storage   \\n8.1 For the purposes of this policy, ‘Cloud’ storage refers to third party web-based data storage such as Microsoft OneDrive, Google Drive, Dropbox etc.   \\n8.1 No cloud storage services should be used to store research data other than the University provided OneDrive account, unless mandated by the funder or statutory body.   \\n8.2 Personal OneDrive accounts should not be used to store or access research data. Only accounts linked to QMU credentials should be used.   \\n8.3 Prior to research staff leaving the employment of QMU, data stored in their OneDrive account should be transferred to an existing member of staff’s account as directed by the Head of Division.  This is to avoid loss of access to data.  \\n\\nAdvice can be sought from IT if required via the Helpdesk assist@qmu.ac.uk.  \\n\\n8.4 Care must be taken when sharing data via OneDrive to ensure continuation of data security and privacy.  \\n\\n8.5 Multi Factor Authentication should be enabled for access to the OneDrive folder on any connected device.  Assistance on this can be provided by the IT team via the Helpdesk, assist@qmu.ac.uk.  \\n\\n## 8 Policy Governance  \\n\\nThis policy is owned by the Research Data Management Working Group on behalf of the Research Steering Committee.  \\n\\nThe policy will be reviewed annually on the anniversary of its approval or in response to any legislative changes.  \\n\\n## 9 Compliance  \\n\\nWilful failure to comply with this policy will be treated extremely seriously by the University and may result in disciplinary action.  Failure to comply may also result in withdrawal of research funding.\",\n",
       " '# Research Data Access and Management Policy  \\n\\n## 1  Background  \\n\\nA 2008 HEFCE-funded report defines research data as “the evidence base on which academic researchers build their analytic or other work.” Data management, including planning for long-term storage and sharing, is an increasingly important aspect of the UK Research funding environment. Most grant applications for research which will generate digital data sets require a data management plan that meets the 2011 Research Councils UK (RCUK) policy; this states that: ‘Publicly funded research data are a public good, produced in the public interest, which should be made openly available with as few restrictions as possible in a timely and responsible manner that does not harm intellectual property:’   \\n   \\n\\nAs of May 2012, RCUK required all funded universities to have a data management policy and road map in place, that will be fully implemented by 2015 to meet their expectations for data sharing, as follows:  \\n\\npublicly funded research data should be made openly available in a timely manner;   \\ndata with acknowledged long term value should be made accessible;   \\nRCUK recognises that there are legal, ethical and commercial constraints on release of research data. To ensure that the research process is not damaged by inappropriate release of data, research organisation policies and practices should ensure that these are considered at all stages in the research process;   \\nResearch Council funded work may be entitled to a limited period of privileged use of the data.  \\n\\nA summary of funder data management/sharing requirements can be found here:    \\n\\n## 2  Guidelines for researchers on Open Data  \\n\\n1. In general, access to the data underlying research has a range of advantages - it promotes the progress of research as a whole, allows for the validation and reproduction of research findings, and enables the efficient and costeffective creation of additional social and economic value.  \\n\\n2. Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) is committed to the general principle of open access (OA) to research, and the data underlying such research, subject to the necessary constraints of any funder, legal and ethical requirements, and following QMUL policies, guidelines and standards. For OA please see the QMUL Guidelines on Open Access, and for research data, please see the Research Data Access and Management Policy below.  \\n\\n3. The process of fully implementing appropriate repositories and resources for implementing OA to research data within QMUL will take a number of years, and it is expected that researchers will gradually increase the use of such resources over such a period.  \\n\\n4. Data identified for open access will be offered for deposit either in a QMUL or an appropriate external repository, in accordance with relevant standards and community best practice, which may be determined by the area of research activity.  \\n\\n5. Links to repositories and descriptions of the means of access are expected to be made via the QMUL Publists system as this evolves.  \\n\\n6. The Research Data Management Group will set up and manage the necessary resources for the implementation of the research data access and management policy, and will be issuing further guidance as this project continues.  \\n\\n### Further information  \\n\\nFor information about open access please see the Queen Mary Library research   \\nwebpages   \\n    \\nThe QMUL Guidelines on Open Access are available at   \\n    \\ninciples%20&%20Guidance.pdf   \\nFor information about IT Services support for IT resourcing and data management   \\nrequirements please see the ITS webpages at   \\n   \\n\\n# 3  Research Data Access and Management Policy  \\n\\n1. Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) is committed to the general principle of Open Access to research, including to research datai within the necessary constraints of any funder, legal and ethical requirements, and following QMUL policies, guidelines and standards.  \\n\\n2. Due to the particular concerns around access to medical-related data, access to data that is associated with medical research will be governed by the relevant funder’s policies on datasharing. If a funder does not have such a policy, then the MRC’s policy on data-sharing should be the default policy ii  \\n\\n3. Where reasonably practicable, publicly funded research data should be made available for access, subject to such conditions as are necessary to ensure compliance with legal, data protection, ethical, confidentiality, IP protection, security or funder obligations.  \\n\\n4. Data identified for open access will be offered for deposit either in a QMUL or an appropriate external repository, in accordance with relevant standards and community best practice, which may be determined by the area of research activity.  \\n\\n5. Data must be retained intact in an appropriate format and storage facility according to funder requirements and consonant with any data management plans approved as part of any funding.  \\n\\n6. The rights of researchers to the exclusive use of research data that they generate as part of a well-defined research project will be protected up until the point of publication or public availability.  \\n\\n7. Where data is made available on request rather than via straightforward open access the rationale for this must be made public, and such availability should not be unreasonably withheld.  \\n\\n8. Data arising from research involving human subjects can only be made accessible if those subjects give their informed consent in advance in writing for the future public release of their data, with clear and study- specific explanations of how the data will be anonymised so that it will not be possible for those in receipt of the data to identify any individuals. Where it has been determined that it would be inappropriate to make such data accessible, for example because it might lead to identification of research subjects or because seeking consent would make it unlikely that subjects would participate in the research, then the data will remain confidential.  \\n\\n9. For research collaborations, any open access arrangements can only take place with the agreement of all research partners.  \\n\\n10. Where retention is not specified as a condition of funding, data storage and disposal will be determined by the nature of the research activity and would normally be retained for a period of at least 10 years for non clinical and at least 20 years for all clinical based activities from the date of any publication which is based upon it, as specified in the QMUL Records Retention schedule.  \\n\\n11. Protocols for research in which data will be generated or reused should include data management plans that explicitly address data capture, management, integrity, confidentiality, retention, sharing and publication. These plans will be retained by QMUL to guide future management of the data.   \\n12. The Principal Investigator, or most senior QMUL researcher, in a research project, has responsibility for ensuring that research data management requirements are observed during a research project or programme that they are undertaking.   \\n13. Those responsible for research staff and students should ensure that researchers in their areas are aware of this policy and any associated guidelines and procedures.   \\n14. All researchers are expected to familiarise themselves with and act in accordance with this and other QMUL policies relating to research practice. This information will be made accessible from the QMUL research webpages, both external and internal.   \\n15. QMUL will provide advice, training and support regarding research data management.   \\n16. The Research Data Management Group will set up and manage the necessary resources for the implementation of this policy.   \\n17. Any queries on the application of this policy should be directed to the VicePrincipal (Research).   \\n18. Appeals against the withholding of data may be made in writing to the VicePrincipal (Research), who will review the case from the researcher or their representative for withholding data, and the appeal case, in the light of this policy and other relevant policies, and make a final decision.',\n",
       " '# QuTech Research Data Management Policy  \\n\\n  \\n\\n# QuTech Research Data Management Policy  \\n\\n## Preface  \\n\\nThe QuTech Research Data Management Policy is part of the central TU Delft Research Data Framework Policy (which outlines the roles of the Library, ICT Department, University Services and the Executive Board at TU Delft).1 This policy helps create effective practices for working with research data at the research institute, and defines data management roles and responsibilities of the different stakeholders within QuTech from the 1st of April 2022 onwards.  \\n\\nThe principles outlined in this policy are elaborated in more detail, with supporting information available in the online guidance.  \\n\\nThis policy is motivated by the belief that good data management is an essential research skill, leads to research that is more time- and cost-efficient as it prevents data and information loss and duplication of efforts and is required to guarantee the quality, reproducibility and impact of research. This policy is inspired by the FAIR principles: research data should be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) by archiving the data with proper documentation.  \\n\\nThis policy cultivates:  \\n\\nBest practice for ensuring that scientific arguments and results are reproducible in the long term.   \\nBetter exposure of academic work of researchers at QuTech and TU Delft leading to recognition of the quality of the research process.   \\nResponsible management of research data, including the protection of intellectual property rights and export control of data   \\nImproved practices for meeting the demands of funders and publishers with respect to research data management and sharing.   \\nLong term preservation of the data underlying publications for future researchers within and outside the research group. This cannot be guaranteed by publishing the data in supplementary materials or by only making the data available upon request.  \\n\\nThis policy recognises that:  \\n\\nIndividual divisions and research groups have different working practices and processes and will therefore require dedicated guidelines.   \\nResearch Data Management covers the entire process of managing research data from its creation to its re-use and preservation, which is not equal to Open Science. While it is beneficial to publish research data openly, there might be valid ethical, legal, security or commercial implications, which will make data unsuitable for open sharing.   \\nResearch data is the evidence that underpins answers to research questions, and which is necessary to validate research findings, and includes but is not limited to measurement data, source code, algorithms, simulations and models and other forms of information supporting traditional publications.  \\n\\nThe term raw data is not always uniquely defined. Moreover, this policy recognizes that not necessarily all binary data generated (e.g., by a physical measurement or simulation run) is or was useful for scientific studies or was accessible to the researcher. Therefore, in this policy the term raw data should be interpreted as a sufficient set of data necessary to fully verify and/or replicate the experimental, theoretical or computational results presented as research findings. There is a limit on the amount of information on reproducing research data that is possible to convey by publishing data, and there always remains know-how and expertise (e.g. operating measurements, sample preparation, etc) which is not easy to document and is not usually made public. Some researchers of QuTech are also affiliated with faculties of TU Delft with their own research data policy. If a policy point is not noted here, they should follow the research data policy of their faculty, but otherwise the most stringent requirement needs to be followed.  \\n\\nThe key points of this policy are:  \\n\\nAll individuals involved in research follow the research data management strategy of QuTech and their research group.   \\nAll individuals involved in research attend data management training when required or needed.   \\nResearch data and code needed to reproduce research findings are appropriately documented, stored and shared in a suitable repository. More specifically, the raw and derived data, as well as software scripts used for the full data processing chain, that produce the final figures or tables of a research article are to be published in a trusted data repository (e.g. 4TU.ResearchData or Zenodo.org)   \\nData Stewards can assist researchers in these activities.  \\n\\n## QuTech Roles and Responsibilities  \\n\\n### All individuals involved in research are responsible for:  \\n\\nEnsuring that research data, code and any other materials needed to reproduce research findings are appropriately documented, stored and shared in a research data repository in accordance with the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) for at least 10 years from the end of the research project, unless there are valid reasons not to do so.  \\n\\nThe requirement is that both raw and derived data, as well as the software scripts used for the full data processing chain, that produce the final figures or tables of a publication are published in a trusted data repository such as 4TU.ResearchData or Zenodo.org (also coined as Level 1 data by Quantum Nanoscience department2) no later than the publication of a peer reviewed research article or submission of a traditional research article to a preprint archive (e.g. to arXiv.org). Additionally, the required research data also needs to be made available for the review process of said article through the journal or a data repository. Note that publication of data should be under an as open as possible license3. It is also highly encouraged to record the version of all software components used in generation, analysis or processing of data. Moreover, it is required to deposit code which has been used in the analysis or processing of data together with the published dataset (see also TU Delft Research Software Policy4 for more details on publication of code/software).   \\nNote that deposition (in public data repositories) of datasets not directly linked with publications is not required but encouraged if the data can possibly be used for other scopes than initially intended.   \\nShould data which underlies publications, because of valid reasons (e.g. to protect IP sensitive data) not be made available in a public repository, it should be ensured that the data management plan and any research publications resulting from the project have a statement explaining what additional datasets/materials exists; why access is restricted; who can use the data and under what circumstances. Contractual agreements with third parties on confidentiality of data should be respected at all times.   \\nUnderstanding who owns research data resulting from their projects and what that implies in terms of data management, particularly sharing and publishing.   \\nProperly citing research data, in accordance with the FORCE11 Joint Declaration of Data Citation Principles.5   \\nUndertaking training in good data management, where advised.  \\n\\n### PhD students are responsible for:  \\n\\nDeveloping a written data management plan (DMP) for managing research outputs within the first 12 months of the PhD study with consultation and feedback of the data steward. (As part of the Go/No-Go meeting. For all PhDs starting from 1 January 2020 onwards.)   \\nAttending the relevant training in data management either through the Graduate School of their Faculty, for which credits can be obtained or through research data seminars provided by QuTech.   \\nEnsuring that all data and code underlying first author publications and completed PhD theses are appropriately documented and are made accessible for at least 10 years from the end of the research project via a trusted data repository (4TU.ResearchData or Zenodo), in accordance with the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable), unless there are valid reasons which make research data unsuitable for sharing. (For all PhDs starting from 1 January 2019 onwards.)  \\n\\n### Principal investigators are responsible for:  \\n\\nEstablishing a research data management strategy for their research group (which is   \\nencouraged to be documented and accessible for relevant QuTech employees) and ensuring that all members of the research group (including students, researchers and support staff involved in research) are aware of the FAIR data principles, are appropriately trained to effectively manage research data, are aware of data storage solutions at QuTech or TU Delft and that members of the research group adhere to the expectations outlined within this policy. Ensuring that all members of the group plan for good data management from the outset of any research project by writing a data management plan with the appropriate template and adhere to good data management practice throughout the project’s lifecycle.   \\nEnsuring that where projects are funded by external parties or are in collaboration with external parties, agreements made with those parties strive for compliance with this policy and determine maximal embargo periods. Research funded primarily by third parties will have to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to ensure the best interests of all parties involved.   \\nBudgeting for the costs of research data management into financial project planning at the proposal stage.  \\n\\n### Bachelor/Master thesis Supervisors are responsible for:  \\n\\nEnsuring that the project’s data management is in line with this policy.

(As part of   \\nthe Go/No-Go meeting. For all PhDs starting from 1 January 2020 onwards.) The PhD Supervisor is responsible for reviewing and approving the DMP and the Data Steward can be contacted for advice and support.   \\nEnsuring that PhD students attend relevant training on data management, either   \\nthrough the Graduate School of their Faculty, for which credits can be obtained or   \\nthrough research data seminars provided by QuTech.   \\nEnsuring that their PhD students make all data and code underlying their completed   \\nPhD theses and publications appropriately documented and accessible in a trusted data  \\n\\nrepository (such as 4TU ResearchData or Zenodo) for at least 10 years from the end of the research project, in accordance with the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable), unless there are valid reasons which make research data unsuitable for sharing. (For all PhDs starting from 1 January 2019 onwards.)  \\n\\n### Data Stewards are responsible for:  \\n\\nFacilitating the development, review and implementation of the QuTech data management policy.   \\nCreating awareness and explaining to researchers the added value of good data management. Supporting research teams in developing and maintaining documentation on data management processes and making it accessible to all relevant QuTech employees.   \\nAssisting researchers in planning the collection, management, and publication of data in research projects and liaising with other service providers (such as Legal services, ICT, Human Research Ethics Committee) as required.   \\nHelping researchers with writing data management plans and with budgeting for research data management costs in their grant applications.   \\nDeveloping and running training events tailored to researchers’ needs.   \\nIdentifying researchers who already have good data management practices and encouraging them to become Data Champions6 to establish local contact points of expertise.   \\nAdvising researchers on regulations for working with IP sensitive data possibly together in collaboration with the private partner.  \\n\\n### Division Research Leads are responsible for:  \\n\\nEnsuring that PI’s have a research data management strategy in place and documented, consistent with the QuTech Research Data Policy.   \\nMonitoring and reviewing of data management practices in the department.   \\nDiscussing data management practices with members of the department and encouraging them to adhere to best practices.   \\nSupporting Data Stewards in identifying Data Champion candidates.  \\n\\n### The Director Research is responsible for:  \\n\\nEnsuring that a Data Steward is embedded within QuTech.   \\nThe development of the QuTech Policy for Research Data Management, consisting of department/section specific implementation regulations and goals (e.g. Key Performance Indicators) where necessary.   \\nEnsuring that research data management is embedded in QuTech regulations.   \\nEnsuring that reporting on research data management progress is part of the yearly Planning and Control cycle.',\n",
       " '# Radboud University Guidelines for Research Data Management  \\n\\nEstablished by the Executive Board on 11 July 2023  \\n\\n## 1. Preamble  \\n\\nGood research data management (RDM) is important for several reasons. To begin with, ensuring research integrity requires that research results are verifiable. This verifiability requires the findability and accessibility of research data.  \\n\\nSecondly, findable and accessible research data enable other researchers to reproduce or replicate research, where possible. This, in turn, contributes to the quality of scientific research.  \\n\\nThirdly, the effective management of research data contributes to the potential of its reuse. Making research data findable, accessible and understandable to other researchers contributes to the possibility of using these research data again, in other research. This encourages the efficient and effective use of research resources.  \\n\\nThe fourth reason why research data should be properly managed is that it improves the prospects for the recognition and accountability of research. Datasets are increasingly being recognised as stand-alone research outputs, and when properly archived and registered this information can be more adequately considered in the assessment and evaluation of research.  \\n\\nA fifth aspect of importance is privacy. The effective management of research data is necessary for ensuring that any privacy-sensitive information that is collected in the context of scientific research is adequately processed, stored and archived. In this respect, RDM also contributes to ethically responsible research.  \\n\\nFinally, there is also the fact that RDM is becoming more and more important in national and international research policy, and that research funding bodies and scientific journals are increasingly imposing requirements with respect to the archiving and accessibility of research data. This is another reason why the archiving and registration of research data needs to be organised properly.  \\n\\n## 2. Legal and policy frameworks  \\n\\nThese guidelines elaborate on, or supplement, the following legal and policy frameworks:  \\n\\nRadboud University’s general strategy on research and impact, and more specifically, its strategy on open science   \\nThe Netherlands Code of Conduct for Research Integrity   \\nThe General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)   \\nRadboud University’s Doctorate Regulations   \\nRadboud University’s Knowledge Security Guidelines   \\nThe requirements from research funding bodies and scientific journals with respect to research data management.  \\n\\n## 3. General principles for research data management at Radboud University  \\n\\nThe following general principles apply to research data management at Radboud University:  \\n\\n1. It is recommended that a data management plan (DMP) is written prior to any study in which research data are to be collected. In their RDM policies, research institutes are free to determine whether, and if so in which cases, a data management plan must be written. This potential obligation is then supplementary to the requirements of the research funding bodies with regard to Data Management Plans.   \\n2. Research data that are collected and processed while research is being carried out should be stored at a facility that is adequate in terms of availability (the data may not inadvertently be lost), integrity (the data may not inadvertently be modified) and confidentiality (the data may not inadvertently be made available to unauthorised persons).   \\n3. Research data should be archived as open as possible, as closed as necessary. The starting point is that research data should be made publicly available. The only reasons for deviating from this starting point include those that are necessary due to privacy, knowledge security, or other serious grounds. In their RDM policies, research institutes should specify the conditions for open or closed archiving of research data, if relevant.   \\n4. Research data that pertain to scientific publications should meet both the findability and accessibility requirements. In the case of scientific publications that are based on research data, of which one or more Radboud University researchers are authors, it should be evident how the corresponding data can be found and the access management should be well-organised. These requirements should be met within as short a reasonable time as possible once the data collection has been completed, and no later than the moment that the first scientific publication that is based on the research data is available. Further explanation of this has been provided in Appendix 1.   \\n5. The minimum retention period for research data that is required for checking or verifying scientific publications is ten years from the time that the scientific publication is available.  \\n\\n## 4. Systems and support for research data  \\n\\nRadboud University provides systems and support for the processing, storage, archiving, publishing and registration of research data. Research institutes are free to make choices about the systems that they use to manage their research data, as long as these systems allow them to comply with the present guidelines.  \\n\\nRadboud University provides researchers with support, knowledge and advice on research data management.  \\n\\n### 5. Responsibilities of the research institutes  \\n\\nEach research institute at Radboud University has its own research data management policy. The research institute’s RDM policy is a further elaboration of the present guidelines, which is consistent with the research areas in which the research institute is involved.  \\n\\nThe researcher and the project manager are primarily responsible for the effective management of research data, and consequently adhere to the policy of the research institute and, in the case of PhD research, the Doctorate Regulations. The Director of Research is responsible for the  \\n\\ndevelopment, establishment and possible modification of the research institute’s RDM policy, and for ensuring its implementation and compliance.  \\n\\nEach research institute has one or more data stewards. Data stewards advise researchers and the research institute’s board on research data management and the implementation of and compliance with the research institute’s RDM policy. They also inform researchers about the facilities that are available for research data and privacy. A detailed description of the data stewards’ tasks and responsibilities can be found in Appendix 2.  \\n\\n## 6. Research data management within the context of PhD research  \\n\\nAdditional requirements apply to the management of research data within the context of PhD research. These requirements have been included in Radboud University’s Doctorate Regulations.  \\n\\n## 7. Research data management in education  \\n\\nResearch data pertaining to Bachelor’s or Master’s theses are stored at a facility that is adequate in terms of availability (the data may not inadvertently be lost), integrity (the data may not inadvertently be modified) and confidentiality (the data may not inadvertently be made available to unauthorised persons). Radboud University provides a system that is suitable for this purpose. Education institutes are free to use this system at their own discretion.  \\n\\nThe retention period for research data pertaining to Bachelor’s and Master’s theses is equivalent to the legal retention period for theses, i.e., seven years.  \\n\\nWithin the Bachelor’s and Master’s programmes, attention is paid to RDM in a manner that is appropriate to the discipline and the phase of the study programme. Bachelor’s and Master’s theses include a statement on the management of the research data pertaining to the thesis.  \\n\\nThe Director of Education is responsible for implementing and enforcing the RDM policy, insofar as it relates to academic higher education.  \\n\\nIt is also possible that research data pertaining to Bachelor’s or Master’s theses are part of the research that has been carried out by a researcher or Project Manager. In this case, the general principles for research data management within scientific research, as described in the previous sections, apply.  \\n\\n## Appendix 1: Findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability (FAIR)  \\n\\nThe findability and accessibility of research data are requirements in Radboud University’s research data management (RDM) policy. The definitions of these requirements are based on the common definitions of the FAIR principles (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable). These can be found in the influential paper by Wilkinson and colleagues (2016)1 and on the GO FAIR initiative website2. An explanation of FAIR can also be found on Radboud University’s RDM website.  \\n\\nFindability means that research data can be found in a simple, unambiguous and sustainable manner, both within and outside the organisation, also by persons other than the researcher him or herself. Internal findability refers to the idea that data can be found by colleagues, for instance, and that data can be found for the purpose of gathering management information on RDM and research output. External findability refers to the idea that data can be found by peers who are interested in research data associated with a publication, for instance, and that datasets can be found by search engines. This is made possible in the following way:  \\n\\nDatasets are assigned a persistent identifier (PID). A PID is a permanent and unique reference that is independent of the data storage location. A well-known example of a PID is a DOI (Digital Object Identifier).   \\nData are accompanied by rich metadata. Metadata is defined as the data that describe the properties of data or a dataset, e.g., title, author, date, descriptive notes and applicable access restrictions. Comprehensive and detailed metadata enhance the findability of a dataset. Rich metadata also include descriptions of the context, content and properties of the data, as part of the documentation of a dataset.   \\nThe PID of the dataset is part of the metadata that describe the data.   \\nData and/or metadata are registered or indexed in a searchable information source. Th registration or indexing makes it possible to find the chosen archive and its subsequent content via common search engines such as Google Scholar.  \\n\\nAccessibility is not about making research data accessible to everyone at all times, but about the proper regulation and registration of the conditions under which it is possible to access the data and how this can be done (effective access management). This is made possible in the following way:  \\n\\nAccess to data and/or metadata is regulated through a standardised protocol and, if necessary, an access procedure is also used.   \\nThe metadata are preserved, even when the full dataset is no longer available.3 This makes it possible to find researchers, organisations and publications that relate to the original research, even at a later date.  \\n\\nRadboud University seeks to ensure the interoperability and reusability of research data. However, these are not current requirements in Radboud University’s RDM policy. Interoperability requires that data can be interpreted and combined, both by people and through automation. Reusability requires that data and metadata are accompanied by explanatory information and that they are accurately described to the point that it is possible to reuse, replicate and combine the data in different contexts and situations.  \\n\\n## Appendix 2: Tasks and responsibilities of the data stewards  \\n\\nEach of Radboud University’s research institutes has one or more data stewards.

Research data provides the evidence of academic endeavours and in conjunction with publications, forms an important part of the scholarly record. Research data is a valuable asset and good management of research data brings benefits to the researcher, the University and the wider community. All researchers at RGU create or use some type of data as part the research process.\\n\\nResponsible handling of research data provides a clear indication that the institution and individual researchers are operating with integrity.\\n\\nSharing research data appropriately enhances the value and impact of research, therefore, RGU supports:\\n\\nthe UkRl position that publicly funded research data is a public good and that it should be made openly available with as few restrictions as possible in a timely and responsible manner\\n\\n1.3.1.1 \"Publicly funded\" includes any research undertaken whilst employed or studying at RGU, including where studies are self-funded. Specific contractual arrangements relating to research funded by a commercial interest may be put in place on a case by case basis\\n\\n1.3.2 the principles set out in the Concordat on Open Research Data the UKRI common principles on data policy\\n\\n1.3.4 the FAIR data principles\\n\\nRGU advocates an open access approach to research data wherever possible. However, open access needs to be balanced with the constraints of security, confidentiality and commercial interest.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis policy provides detailed information to supplement the RGu Research Governance and Integrity policy. Safe and ethical handling of data is a fundamental part of good practice for research, demonstrating; honesty, rigour, transparency and open communication, care and respect. The RGU Information Governance Policy also provides context, with explicit explanation of the legislative environment governing the handling of any personal data.\\n\\n### Legislation and Standards\\n\\nResearchers are responsible for making themselves familiar with and adhering to legislation, ethical standards, (in particular NHs Ethics Committee requirements & Caldicott), regulatory requirements and contractual obligations including funder policies that pertain to their research.\\n\\nKey legislation includes; the Data Protection Act (2o18) and General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) (2O18), the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act (2002), Intellectual Property Rights (2014), and Copyright (1988).\\n\\nThe UK government promotes open research data as part of all the research it funds including research commissioned with industry and HEI partners.\\n\\nConcordat on Open Research Data\\n\\nIn keeping with the principles outlined in the Concordat on Open Research Data RGU aims to demonstrate that the research community;\\n\\nare acting in an appropriate manner concerning research data\\nconform to all ethical legal and professional obligations relevant to their work .1.3 nurture a research environment that makes data open wherever practical and affordable\\nuse transparent, robust and fair processes to make decisions concerning data openness\\n\\n\\n\\nhave appropriate mechanisms in place to provide assurances as to the integrity of their research data and recognise the importance of data citation and credit acknowledgement\\n\\n### 4.

Introduction\\n\\nThis policy presents the principles of good research data management (RDM) within the Royal College of Art (RCA), as well as outlining the roles and responsibilities of the RCA and its staff and students in this respect. Research data is an asset and the RCA recognises its benefit and impact for wider society, the research community, the RCA and its individual researchers. Effective management of research data allows for extension of the value of data beyond the life of any research project, through data openness and sharing, and is an important part of good research conduct. Well managed data leads to higher quality research, increased research visibility and enhanced research collaboration opportunities. RDM is important in light of increasingly collaborative nature of research, where researchers need to share data across platforms and thus need effective systems and processes for storing, accessing and sharing data securely across multi-institutional research teams.\\n\\nResearch data is increasingly being shared and published openly, and public research funders now request a data management plan (DMP) to be delivered with each project they fund1. The plans describe the plans for management of data through the project lifecycle as well plans for storage and curation of data after the project ends. Funders ask that data be published openly if possible, but demonstrate an understanding that some data may not be deemed suitable for open publishing due to legal, commercial and ethical reasons.\\n\\nThe concept of research data within art and design may differ somewhat from that of other disciplines. Research at the RCA encompasses a broad range of disciplines, to include Architecture, Design, Robotics and Materials Science. The variety of research data created within the RCA will take many forms and will mirror this variety of disciplines, processes and the different types of output developed through research and innovation.\\n\\nRCA is a research-intensive specialist art and design university, which is committed to upholding highest standards of academic research with their staff, students and the broader research community. We aim for research excellence, through providing a supportive research environment, to research staff and students. To this end, RCA has produced this Policy and provides services and guidance to support research staff and students in undertaking best practice in RDM. To further support staff in implementing this policy, RCA facilitates appropriate digital infrastructure to ensure that data is securely stored and is findable, accessible, interoperable and re-usable by others. The RCA understands that not all data can be shared, or made open, due to legal, commercial and ethical reasons, but also that these issues should not stand in the way of good research data management.\\n\\n## 2. Scope\\n\\n2.1 This policy applies to all data generated through research undertaken by RCA research staff and students (henceforth referred to as researchers), either solely or in collaboration with others. This includes, but is not limited to, research sponsored by grant funding or commercial contracts awarded to RCA and to other institutions with which RCA partners in undertaking research.\\n\\n2.2 The research data referred to in this policy includes, but is not limited to: image data (2D, 3D and video), audio data (music, sounds) sketchbooks, log books, trials, prototypes, ceramic glaze recipes, objects, and correspondence. Furthermore, data collected from human participants in the form of fieldnotes, photographs, survey findings, interview and focus group transcripts falls under the remit of research data and this policy.\\n\\n2.3 RCA researchers should familiarise themselves with this policy, and consult it prior to commencing a research project or research student supervision. An ‘at a glance’ summary is provided in Annex X.\\n\\n2.4 This policy should be read in conjunction with other related RCA policies, including the RCA Research Ethics Policy, the RCA Information and Data Management Policy, RCA Policy on Ownership, Protection and Exploitation of Intellectual Property Rights, and RCA Open Access Policy. Links to these policy documents are in Annex B.\\n\\n## 3. Definitions\\n\\n3.1 Data Management Plan: A Data Management Plan outlines what data is likely to be created through the course of research and how. The plan also outlines plans for the preservation of the data and how/if it will be shared, stating any restrictions on access that may need to be applied.\\n\\n3.2 Data Repository: A place for preserving digital data after a project ends, and making it available for others to use. Selecting a trusted repository for your data The RCA research repository (ePrints), a discipline specific repository or a funder repository) is beneficial in that it will relieve the researcher of the long-term management of the data and will ensure its long term accessibility.\\n\\n3.3 Principal Investigator: A person who is ultimately responsible for a research project. This includes intellectual, managerial and financial responsibility of research.\\n\\n3.4 Permanent Digital Identifier (PDI): A unique permanent digital identifier used to identify datasets and publications. The PDI is fixed for the lifetime of the data and ensures that data can be cited appropriately to ensure credit is given to its creator/s.\\n\\n3.5 Metadata: Metadata provides information about the dataset. This information includes descriptive information such as keywords, author, title and also process data which will describe methods through which data is collected and processed. Good standard metadata is vital for enabling the finding and reuse of data.\\n\\n3.6 Data Licencing: Datasets should have a licence that states clearly what the re-use rights are. This will allow researchers who find a dataset to immediately know what they are allowed to do with it. For example, licenced images or music will state how specifically whether commercial use is allowed, whether the work can be remixed or tweaked, or whether it can be downloaded only. Licencing also applies to research data.\\n\\n## 4. Guiding principles\\n\\n4.1 RDM is part of good research practice and as such adds value to research outputs and increases their impact. This policy will guide RCA researchers to undertake best practice in RDM to ensure excellence in research conduct and to comply with funders’ requirements of data management, openness and sharing.\\n\\n4.2 This policy’s guiding principles take inspiration from the UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) Common principles on data policy2, and the Concordat on Open Research Data3 which guides the UK research community on best practices in RDM, and on making their data openly available for use wherever possible.\\n\\nPrinciple 1: Good research data management is fundamental to all stages of the research process and should be established at the outset. Data with long-term value should be preserved and should remain accessible and usable for future research.\\n\\nPrinciple 2: Data from research funded by public funds is a public good and should be made accessible and open, whenever possible. Open research data safeguards efficient and effective research practice,  facilitates high quality research, and drives innovation.\\n\\nPrinciple 3: To enable research data to be discoverable and effectively re-used by others, researchers should use the FAIR4 principles for guidance and as far as possible make data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable.\\n\\nPrinciple 4: There may be ethical, legal and commercial aspects to research, which may hinder the sharing of research data. Researchers should ensure that these are considered at all stages in the research process, to avoid publishing and sharing unsuitable data.\\n\\nPrinciple 5: Researchers should acknowledge and properly cite the sources of data they use in their research to recognise the intellectual contribution of their fellow researchers, who generate, preserve and share their datasets.\\n\\nPrinciple 6: Researchers that publish data should provide adequate and persistent information for the research data to be cited, to support best research practice.\\n\\n## 5. Responsibilities\\n\\nThis section presents the key roles and responsibilities of the RCA and its researchers. The RCA is fully committed to excellence in research data management and will thus provide support to researchers so that they may fulfil their responsibilities, set out in this section. Key support will be provided by RCA’s Schools and Centres, Research Support Office, Library and IT as outlined here.\\n\\n### 5.1 The Royal College of Art\\n\\n5.1.1 Schools and research centres 5.1.1.1 RCA Schools and Research Centres are responsible for promoting this policy to their researchers and ensuring that they adhere to their obligations listed in section 5.2.\\n\\n5.1.2 Research and Knowledge Exchange Office\\n\\n5.1.2.1 As part of grant application review and approval process Research and Knowledge Exchange staff are responsible for ensuring that all applications include a Data Management Plan.\\n\\n5.1.2.3. Research and Knowledge Exchange Office will advise researchers on any ethical or legal issues that may hinder data sharing/openness.\\n\\n#### 5.1.3 Library\\n\\n5.1.3.1 The Scholarly Communications Librarian, with the support of IT, will provide advice on all aspects of RDM. This includes advising researchers on data repositories, metadata standards, data formats, PDIs, data citation, copyright and data licences.\\n\\n5.1.2.2 The Scholarly Communications Librarian, in consultation with the Research and Knowledge Exchange Office as needed, will advise on the development of generic and funder-specific DMPs.\\n\\n5.1.3.2 The Library will maintain a collection of latest versions of funder DMP templates and the RCA generic template.\\n\\n5.1.3.3 The Library maintains a publicly available RCA research data catalogue in ePrints based on the information provided to them by PIs. The Library will facilitate the discovery and re-use of research data through publishing sufficient metadata and description of each dataset. Formats that aid re-use should also be used as far as possible.\\n\\n#### 5.1.4 IT\\n\\n5.1.4.1 IT will provide secure storage for research data throughout the research project lifecycle.\\n\\n5.1.4.2 IT will provide technical advice on data storage, backup and archiving of data.\\n\\n5.1.4.3 IT will contribute technical support and advice to researchers on RDM.\\n\\n5.1.4.4 IT, more specifically Information Management, will provide support on support and advice to researchers on legal issues relevant to research data and RDM, e.g. Data Protection (GDPR), and Intellectual Property Rights (IPR).\\n\\n5.2 Principal Investigators\\n\\n5.2.1 Principal Investigators (PIs) have overall responsibility for management of data created or used within their research. This extends also to data used within their research groups. RCA Research and Knowledge Exchange, Library and IT will provide guidance and services to support PIs in the responsibilities outlined here.\\n\\n5.2.2 PIs are responsible for providing Data Management Plans (DMPs) for all research conducted within the RCA. Funder- specific DMP templates should be used where these are available, otherwise the RCA specific templates should be used. Support for this task will be provided to PIs by RCA Library and the Research and Knowledge Exchange Office (refer to Section 5.1 of this policy).\\n\\n5.2.3 During the research process, PIs are responsible for ensuring that their research data is stored securely, to minimize risk of loss or unauthorised access, through using RCA provided services.\\n\\n5.2.4 PIs are responsible for ensuring that research data from completed projects, and that of their group, are preserved and described in ways that maximise the opportunity for discoverability and re-use. This includes the responsibility for supplying adequate metadata and documentation so that data can be found and easily understood, as well as choosing an appropriate data format/s to aid re-usability. Library staff will provide support for both these tasks (refer to clause 5.1.3.1 of this policy).\\n\\n5.2.5 PIs are responsible for identifying and preserving all research data that can be used to validate published research findings in the future, irrespective of whether this data can be shared or opened.\\n\\n5.2.6 PIs are responsible for identifying which data can be shared. The minimum is all data that is relevant to supporting published findings. If this is data from human subjects, PIs are responsible for conducting any data sharing in a legal and ethical manner. PIs also have responsibility to know, and comply with, funder requirements in this respect.\\n\\n5.2.7 PIs shall publish their sharable research data in a publicly available repository, no later than at the point of publication of findings. Should funder requirements differ, with respect to timing of deposit, or which repository should be used5, these take precedence. Before publishing data in a repository, PIs should consider the following:\\n\\n5.2.7.1 The use of embargoes: If the PI is not able to publish data before the funder’s deadline, they should request an extension of the embargo period from the funder. This means that the data remains available only to the researcher for a set period of time.\\n\\n5.2.7.2 Copyright and Intellectual Property Rights: PIs should not share data that infringes on copyright and IPR. Where third-party data is used, access conditions should be understood and followed and any data used should be cited appropriately. Researchers should also refer to the RCA Policy on Ownership, Protection and Exploitation of Intellectual Property Rights for further guidance.\\n\\n5.2.7.3 Commercialisation: PIs engaged in collaborative research with commercial partners must acknowledge that data provided by these may be restricted for commercial reasons. In the case of funded research, PIs should familiarise themselves with funder requirements regarding data management and sharing from commercial research.\\n\\n5.2.7.4 Licencing: PIs should select a licence under which to publish their data and aim for licences that permit sharing and reuse.\\n\\n5.2.7.5 Ethical concerns: PIs should take into consideration any ethical issues that may prevent data from being shared. Researchers should refer to the RCA Research Ethics Policy for further guidance.\\n\\n5.2.7.6 Privacy: PIs should take all measures to protect privacy of research subjects and should thus anonymise personal data before sharing it. Researchers must understand how some data may not be anonymised to a sufficient standard, which may prevent data from being shared. Researchers should refer to the RCA Research Ethics Policy and the RCA Data Protection Policy for further guidance.\\n\\n5.2.8 Any software developed as part of a research project, should also be managed under this policy.\\n\\n5.2.9 PIs should ensure that all published data has a Persistent Digital Identifier (PDI) and inform the Library of the location of the data, the PDI and the relevant metadata. Repositories, such as the RCA research repository (ePrints), generally issue a PDI for each dataset.\\n\\n5.2.10 Funding for RDM should be requested at application stage where this is an eligible cost allowed by the research funder. Research and Knowledge Exchange Office will assist researchers with the calculation and estimation of costs.\\n\\n5.2.11 PIs will ensure that shareable research data is made publicly available in line with funder requirements or for 10 years, whichever is longer.\\n\\n## 6. Information regarding this policy\\n\\nThe office responsible for this policy is the Research and Knowledge Exchange Office.  If any issues arise in connection with this policy, please contact rke@rca.ac.uk.\\n\\n## 7. Approval and periodic review\\n\\nThis policy will be reviewed in line with RCA requirements, or earlier as needed.\\n\\n## 8. Annexes\\n\\nA. Summary of the RDM Policy\\n\\nThis policy on Research Data Management (RDM) takes as a guiding principle that research data is an important asset and its considered management is part of excellence in research conduct. Well managed data will assist researchers analyse and present their findings, and should the data be deemed to be suitable for publication will allow for validation and scrutiny of research results. Research data is increasingly being shared and published openly, and public research funders now request a data management plan (DMP) to be delivered with each project they fund. The plans describe the plans for management of data through the project lifecycle as well as after it ends. Funders ask that data be published openly if possible, but demonstrate an understanding that some data may not be deemed suitable for open publishing due to legal, commercial and ethical reasons.\\n\\nThis policy presents the roles and responsibilities of the RCA and its research staff in this respect. The Lead researcher on each project (PI) is ultimately responsible for data management, which includes ensuring that:\\n\\nDMPs are created and maintained throughout the lifecycle of a project. If the project is publicly funded, PIs should abide by funder policies in this regard and use their specific DMP template.\\nData is stored securely to avoid data loss or unauthorised access to data.\\nAfter a project ends, data is curated for long term storage in a data repository such as the RCA research repository (ePrints).\\nAn evaluation of whether data can be published openly, after a project ends, is undertaken. If data is deemed to be suitable for open publishing, that appropriate measures are taken so that data is findable, accessible, interoperable and re-useable by others.\\n\\nThe RCA (including Research and Knowledge Exchange Office, Library and IT) is responsible for providing support to researchers so that they can carry out their responsibilities as listed above. The RCA has dedicated expert staff and the appropriate technical infrastructure to assist researchers with all aspects of RDM.\\n\\nB.

This policy aims to provide a strategic framework for the management of data generated by research projects at Royal Holloway. “Research data” is defined here as the recorded information (regardless of the form or the media) necessary to support or validate a research project’s observations, findings or outputs.\\n2. The effective and efficient management of research data is fundamental to high quality research and academic integrity.\\n3. Royal Holloway acknowledges its obligations to its research funders, the research community and the wider public to ensure that the management of research data is not only effective and efficient but also complies with the generally accepted principles of open access: that research data is a public good produced in the public interest and should be made freely and openly available with as few restrictions as possible in a timely and responsible manner.\\n4. In acknowledging its obligations and recognising the benefits, the College aims to encourage a positive approach to the management of research data across the institution.\\n\\n# Policy\\n\\n5. Research data will be managed to agreed standards throughout the research data lifecycle and according to College and funder requirements.\\n6. Responsibility for research data management during any research project or programme lies with the Principal Investigator (PI).\\n7. The College is responsible for the provision of training, support and advice on research data management and such resources/infrastructure or access to resources/infrastructure as necessary for the successful implementation of this policy.\\n8. A Data Management Plan (DMP) that explicitly addresses the capture, management (including the safe storage of active research data), integrity, confidentiality, preservation, sharing and publication of research data must be created and stored in the College’s research information system, Pure, by the PI for each proposed research project or funding application. Sufficient metadata shall also be created and stored to aid discovery and re-use. DMPs should take account of and ensure compliance with relevant legislative frameworks which may limit public access to the data (for example, in the areas of data protection, intellectual property and human rights).\\n9. All research data should be offered and assessed for deposit and preservation in an appropriate College, national or international data service or domain repository, unless specified otherwise in the DMP.\\n10.

       " '# RWTHAACHENUNIVERSITY\\n\\n## Guidelines on the management of research data at RWTH Aachen University\\n\\nRWTH Aachen University aims to make an essential contribution to answering the important research questions of our time and making the new insights available and usable for science and society. Consequently, the management, backup, storage and sustainable availability of research data have to follow recognized standards and meet with high requirements. Legal and ethical responsibilities have to be respected and the particularities of the various subjects have to be considered.\\n\\n1. Research data are data that are gathered, observed, simulated, deduced or generated in the course of research.\\n\\n2. The RWTH supports free access to research data. Researchers are, however, not obliged to make data accessible to persons outside of the project team before processing, evaluating and publishing their research. Exceptions are disclosures to commissions. Contractual agreements also remain unaffected.\\n\\n3. The management of research data includes planning, gathering, processing and storing of the data. It guarantees the access, reuse, reproducibility and quality assurance of all research data that are forming the basis of scientific results.\\n\\n4. The project manager as well as researchers researching on their own responsibility are generally responsible for managing the research data of their research projects. In particular, they are obliged to guarantee the adherence to proven academic research practices as well as the standards of their subject area. All persons involved in a research project are responsible for the correctness of the data they gathered and the compliance to the regulations they agreed upon.\\n\\n5. Research projects with research data require a data management plan which states the research data’s access rights and exceptions.\\n\\n6. The RWTH gives advice on research data management from planning to implementation and even after the completion of the project. Additionally, the RWTH offers appropriate training.\\n\\n7. The RWTH implements and maintains essential services for research data infrastructure and thereby guarantees appropriate storing and technical availability of digital research data. Specific requirements have to be agreed upon and, where necessary, financed.\\n\\n8. Digital research data is stored and archived in the IT and informational infrastructure of RWTH Aachen University or in recognized external or internal subject repositories. RWTH Aachen University and its academics observe in their research data management concerns of ethics, data protection, intellectual property, privacy and disclosure. This does not affect regulations relating to the assessment of research data according to the German employee invention act (Arbeitnehmererfindungsgesetz).\\n\\n9. If rights of reuse or publication are transferred, it should be agreed upon that data remain freely accessible for academic purposes.\\n\\nApproved by the rectorate of RWTH Aachen University on March 8, 2016',\n",
       " \"# Research data management policy\\n\\n## Purpose\\n\\nThe University has policies and procedures in place to ensure good research practice and to sustain programmes of excellent and ethical research. Policies are also concerned with research quality promoting the highest standards of integrity, impartiality and respect for data. The University recognises that effective research data management through the research life cycle is a key component of good research conduct and contributes to a culture of research excellence. Research data is a valuable asset and the University supports the principle of open access to research data as set out by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and Research Councils UK (RCUK). Research data refers to any type of data created, collected or generated in a digital or non-digital form that is analysed to produce original research results.\\n\\nThe aims of this policy are to\\n\\nsupport openness and transparency in research undertaken at the University by ensuring research\\nis of the highest integrity and is underpinned by accurate robust data\\npromote open access to research data to facilitate data sharing and collaboration and support the\\nUniversity's charitable mission of disseminating research findings\\nensure that the University adheres to the Research Councils UK Common Principles on Data\\nPolicy, is compliant with the specific requirements of the EPSRC policy framework on research\\ndata and provides accountability for the use of public funds\\nestablish the responsibilities of researchers in relation to research data management and archiving\\nand set out the University's processes for support and guidance\\n\\n## Policy requirements\\n\\n1. Data management\\n\\n1.1. Responsibility for research data generated during a project lies with the principal investigator or in the case of a PhD project, the director of studies. It is their duty to ensure that all members of the research team with access to the research data adhere to good research data management practice. In the case of collaborative projects, if the principal investigator is based elsewhere, the lead researcher at Sheffield Hallam University must take responsibility for all data generated here.\\n\\n1.2. A data management plan must be produced for all research projects before they commence. Researchers will comply with funder data management requirements. However, where this is not specified, the University will provide a data management plan template for completion.\\n\\n1.3. A collaboration agreement must be in place with external partners before the start of the research that clearly addresses data management.\\n\\n2. Live data\\n\\n2.1. Researchers must comply with funder data management requirements. Where this is not specified researchers must ensure that all active research data is stored securely on the University networked storage system in both original and processed formats. The University has created a central research data file store (the SHU Research Store) for this purpose and will provide advice on technical solutions for research data storage and archiving. Metadata describing the structure and content of the data must be regularly created and updated for project continuity purposes.\\n\\nIf research data needs to be stored temporarily on portable storage devices, such as laptops in the field or cloud storage, the researcher must ensure that this is done securely and that they comply with the University's policies on electronic data encryption.\\n\\n### 3. Archiving\\n\\n3.1. Primary research data produced by University researchers that underpin a publication, which are of potential long-term value and/or support a patent application, must be stored centrally and published when possible to ensure good research practice at the University.\\n\\n3.2. Primary research data, whether in digital or hard copy, may be archived in the SHU Research Data Archive or in an external research data repository. Data must be stored for a period at least as long as that required by any funder or sponsor of the research, any publisher of the research or as set out in the University's Research and Knowledge Transfer Records Retention Schedule.\\n\\n3.3.It is considered good practice to archive all data in a format that will guarantee long-term access and with sufficient metadata to aid discovery to encourage follow-up research. Researchers must also comply with specific funder data management requirements.\\n\\n3.4. All data that are retained must be registered with the SHU Research Data Archive, whether they are hosted by the University or maintained elsewhere, even if access to the data is restricted.\\n\\n### 4. Open access\\n\\n4.1. Researchers must be aware of, and comply with, their funders' requirements for data management including archiving and sharing. If applicable, data must be prepared and offered for deposit in an open access data repository within the timeframe stipulated by the funder unless there are valid reasons not to do so. The latter could include commercial confidentiality, infringement of intellectual property rights, contractual agreements, ethical, legal or regulatory obligations, or where the cost of doing so would be prohibitive.\\n\\n4.2. Even if the funder of the research does not require it, researchers are encouraged to make their archived data accessible to others close to the publication date of any research outputs relying on the data. The data should be in citeable form. This supports the integrity of the University's research and will be beneficial for the research community.\\n\\n4.3. Exclusive rights to re-use or publish research data should not be handed over to commercial publishers or agents without retaining the rights to make the data openly available for re-use unless this is a condition of funding.\\n\\n4.4. Published research outputs reporting publicly funded research must include a short statement describing how and on what terms any supporting research data may be accessed. Research outputs deposited in SHURA should also include this statement.\\n\\n5. Re-using third-party data\\n\\n5.1. Researchers that gain access to and use open research data, or any data generated by others, must do so in a manner that respects the contexts under which it was created and must\\n\\nadhere to the same frameworks and observe any restrictions that may have been imposed during data collection.\\n\\n5.2. All users of research data must formally cite the data they use. The obligation to recognise through citation and acknowledgement the original creators of the data must be respected in all cases.\\n\\n6. Support and further information\\n\\n6.1. The University will provide guidelines, advice and training on research data management, including data management plans, costing of research data management into research proposals, storage and data protection, creation of descriptive metadata, intellectual property and Freedom of Information requests for all researchers.\\n\\n## 7. Scope\\n\\n7.1. This policy applies to all publicly-funded research, whether internally or externally funded, and is considered best-practice for all other research.\\n7.2. Contractual obligations from an external funder or sponsor of the research will take precedence over the stipulations in this policy.\\n\\n### Good practice\\n\\nThe University recognises the following external sources as providing agreed standards of good practice.\\n\\nThe Digital Curation Centre provides expert advice and practical help to anyone in UK higher education and research wanting to store, manage, protect and share digital research data.

With this in mind, it is committed to opening up the results of the research produced within its institutions and promoting their dissemination, in order to share with citizens the fruits of their contribution to public research and to develop a trustworthy science.\\n\\nTaking up for itself the terms of the Sorbonne declaration on research data rights of 27 January 20201, the Sorbonne University Alliance recalls that :\\n\\naccess to and sharing of data enables the development of new knowledge and accelerates discoveries for the benefit of society, while promoting economic development and employment;\\nit must be possible to share and re-use research data freely.\\n\\nThe management of research data, including backup, storage and diffusion, must therefore be carried out in accordance with international standards and practices and meet strict requirements, while ensuring compliance with legal obligations within an ethical framework.\\n\\nFor these reasons, the Sorbonne University Alliance and its members are committed to :\\n\\nencouraging their research teams and staff to open up research data as much as possible;\\npromoting the development of data management plans at the design stage of research protocols;\\nenhancing the commitment of research staff who share their data and work for open science;\\nsetting up training programmes and mobilising the necessary resources to create an environment conducive to open data.\\n\\nConsequently, the member institutions of the Sorbonne University Alliance commit themselves to implementing the following recommendations for the opening of research data.\\n\\n### Recommendations for the opening of research data within the Sorbonne University Alliance\\n\\nTo implement the policy of opening up research data, the institutions of the Sorbonne University Alliance have set themselves the following objectives:\\n\\nto raise awareness of open data among research staff in different communities and disciplines and promote the dissemination of good practice;\\nto advise them on compliance with contractual requirements requested by funding agencies, drafting of data management plans, storage/archiving solutions and their cost, allocation of identifiers, and data curation, including for sensitive data;\\nto work to facilitate the exchange of data and metadata between information systems according to the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles.\\n\\nIn this perspective of opening up and sharing data, the members of the Sorbonne University Alliance recommend setting up a Research Data Helpdesk  in the form of a portal for access to available resources, making it possible in particular:\\n\\nto identify and promote standards, infrastructure, software and IT services for data storage, access and analysis;\\nto direct users to repositories where data can be deposited and described;\\nto put users in touch with experts on technical, legal or innovation-related issues;\\nto ensure pre-publication referencing of datasets;\\nand to promote and use tools and services that support collaboration.\\n\\nIt will be up to the institutions of the Sorbonne University Alliance to co-lead a working group for the construction, steering and management of this helpdesk.\\n\\nEach institution will be able to integrate the services of this helpdesk into its own technical environment.\\n\\nA sharing of resources is clearly desirable and beneficial, subject to prior agreement between the partners concerned.\\n\\nIn the longer term, this helpdesk should also :\\n\\nallow secure access to sensitive or confidential data;\\nsupport the management of 'long tail' data from disciplines that do not have their own research data management infrastructure;\\npropose a solution to link researchers, publications, organisations and funding to the whole output, so as to provide opportunities for 'research in context'.\\n\\nIn order to implement the proposed recommendations and come up with operational solutions, staff and financial resources will be needed in each of the institutions of the Sorbonne University Alliance.\\n\\nIn addition to the initial funding that may be obtained with the PIA allocation, the institutions of the Sorbonne University Alliance undertake to :\\n\\nrespond to regional, national or international calls for projects concerning the opening up of data, either individually or jointly, with the institutions keeping each other informed of any responses to calls for projects that they may make individually;\\nensure the sustainability of the services offered in terms of access to data and metadata, whether shared, stored or archived.\",\n",
       " \"# Staffordshire University Research Data Management Policy\\n\\n## Preamble:\\n\\nGood research data management enables the University and its researchers to meet the standards and responsibilities set out in the University's Code of Conduct for Research and Research Integrity (  and to meet funder, ethical, legal and other responsibilities. This policy is binding on all University members engaged in research, including staff, research students, and affiliates, and others who conduct research on behalf of the University. The policy is guided by and adheres to the UK General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) and the Data Protection Act (2018).\\n\\n# Policy\\n\\n1. Staffordshire University recognises the importance of establishing appropriate systems, policies and processes to govern the ways in which research data generated as part of the University’s research activity are managed.\\n2. This policy applies to all those undertaking research (including staff and postgraduate researchers) and those managing and supporting research; and to all research, whether externally funded or not.\\n3. This policy requires that all those undertaking research store unpublished University research data within Microsoft SharePoint through a Microsoft Teams Team1.\\n4. It is the responsibility of the principal investigator of the research study to ensure the data for their studies is stored according to this policy. It is assumed that research data obtained will be digital, or can be digitised and then stored according to this policy. It is expected that only in very rare cases will it be impossible to digitise the data, in which case the principal investigator should make this clear on the Ethics application, and furthermore make clear how the data will be stored. The principal investigator should further ensure that personal data is stored as required by the University’s Code of Conduct for Research and Research Integrity, and Annex 1 to that code, the ‘Framework for Good Research Practice’2; furthermore, a separate Teams channel, or private channel, should be used for personal data. Personalised data and anonymised data should be stored in separate locations. The principal investigator is the named lead researcher at Staffordshire University responsible for delivery of the research, or the component of research assigned to the University. The principal investigator must describe in the study protocol (or within the research methodology) the name of the Microsoft Teams Team that will be used to store the data, who will have access to the data and what Microsoft Team authority they will have (member or owner). Where named individuals are known, this should be given. In roles that are not yet occupied, the role title should be used. It is the responsibility of all researchers who have access to the data to comply with this policy for all research data that they process. If the ‘raw’ data is not immediately stored on Teams but is captured on a separate device, the data should be uploaded to Teams as soon as is practicable, which must be within two weeks. If it is known before the research starts that this time scale will not be met, this should be made clear on the Ethics application. Before data is transferred, it is the responsibility of the individual to ensure that it is secured according to the legal standards to which this policy adheres and to Staffordshire University IT regulations (  In the case of postgraduate research students, it is the responsibility of both the student and their supervisor to ensure that their research data is stored in accordance with this policy.\\n5. If the principal investigator leaves the University, they must inform their line manager and their School’s Associate Dean for Research and Innovation of the name, description and location of the data. If the research study is still ongoing, a new principal investigator will be assigned, and they will assume responsibility for the research data. In the event that the research study has concluded, or that no one else remains employed at the University, the Associate Dean for Research and Innovation of the School in which the original principal investigator worked will assume responsibility until the data has exceeded its retention period.\\n6. In the event that Staffordshire University is not the lead research organisation, it is recognised that data may need to be transferred and/or stored according to other University’s policy and procedure. Where another organisation’s policy and procedure is put in place, the Staffordshire University (via the principal investigator and copying in dataprotection@staffs.ac.uk) should be notified in writing.\\n7. It is acknowledged that some research data may not be transferred to the University in order to be compliant with legislation. Where this is the case, it should be clearly stated in the study protocol, or within the research methodology before any research activity commences and should be clearly stated in any ethics application documentation.\\n8. When creating a ‘Team’ to store research, a separate site should be created for each research project. This enables appropriate levels of access and control to be applied to each project, and simplifies compliance with any legal, contractual or regulatory requirements.\\n9. When creating a Teams site: The site must be given a meaningful name and include the reference number from the ethics application. If the title contains the word “Research” then a default data retention policy is applied to the team site to preserve all files stored on the “File” tab for 3 years. Privacy levels must be set to “Private – only team owners can add members”. This restricts access to just the individuals that have been authorised by the owner of the site. Site owners should undertake at appropriate intervals reviews of who has access to the site, and remove access from individuals or add access to individuals as appropriate.\\n10. To allow researchers to retain data for a specified period of time, Staffordshire University has implemented a policy that detects key words within SharePoint sites’ description and\\n\\napplies corresponding data protection policies.\\n\\nIf the keywords “Hold1”, “Hold2”, … , “Hold10” are added to a SharePoint site’s description then data on the site is retained for the corresponding number of years (i.e. 1, 2,…10 years) after it was last modified.\\n\\nIf a greater retention period is required, then Digital Services should be contacted to add a custom retention hold to the site.\\n\\n11. Similarly, it may be required to delete data after a specified period. The keywords “Delete1”, “Delete2”, …., “Delete10” can be added to a site to delete data a specified number of years after it was last modified.\\n\\n12. Holds and deletes are calculated for each individual file based on its last modification date.\\n\\n13. If both “Hold” and “Delete” policies apply to a site, then both processes will take effect. If the retention hold is greater than the delete then files will not be deleted until after the hold period.\\n\\n14. Note that if required, a researcher can check what hold/delete policies are applicable to their sites by using  SharePoint search functionality at   Searching for e.g. “description:hold5” would list sites with a five year retention period.\\n\\n15. Researchers who are intending to collect and store highly sensitive/confidential research data should discuss with Digital Services how such data can be protected.\\n\\n16. This could include:\\n\\nRequiring Multi-factor authentication in order to access a team site. This protects from phished/stolen credentials being used to access a site\\nRequiring use of a University managed computer to access a team site. This protects phished/stolen credentials being used to access a site, and makes it more difficult to extract data from a site.\\nPreventing file download from non-university managed computers, but providing a web edit view to authorised users to allow controlled viewing and editing of files. This make it more difficult to extract data from a site, or for ransomware/malware to be\\nintroduced into a site.\",\n",

Introduction\\n\\nThe research as well as environmental monitoring and assessment conducted at SLU shall be characterised by good data management throughout the life cycle. Current legislation and good research practice1 provide the framework for how data shall be managed. SLU endorses the FAIR data sharing principles2 and aims to make data from research and from environmental monitoring and assessment as open as possible and as closed as necessary.\\n\\nThe purpose of this policy is to describe the direction taken by SLU and common principles SLU stands for with regard to data management, the existing legal requirements, and the responsibilities assigned within the University. The policy does not regulate in detail what data shall be made accessible, in what format, or at what time. This assessment must be made by the data producer based on the given circumstances of the project or study in question and the common principles presented in this policy. Good data management also includes clarifying the contexts which necessitate special protection of data. If necessary, the assessment can be made in consultation with the support functions available at the University with the aid of a data management plan as an important tool.\\n\\nThe policy is a comprehensive governing document that is supplemented with additional information and practical instructions on the staff web3.\\n\\nThere is also an extensive guide on data management published by the Swedish Research Council.4\\n\\n## 2. Purpose and scope of the policy\\n\\nOpen knowledge sharing and open science are emphasised in SLU\\'s strategy for 2021-20255, at the national level in the Research Policy Bill for 2021-20246, and at European level in the EU Open Data Directive7. The goal at national level is to make all publicly funded research data openly accessible by 2026, provided there are no legal, security, ethical, or commercial issues. The aim is to increase the quality, dissemination, impact, and innovative power of research. Another reason for making data accessible is to make efficient use of resources. This concerns both financial resources and, for example, a reduction in the use of animal and human experiments. An important starting point for this policy is the national Roadmap for Open Science devised by the Association of Swedish Higher Education8, which clarifies the responsibilities of higher education institutions and the measures required to accelerate the work on open access to research data and results.\\n\\n[Read more about background to and rationale for the policy]\\n\\nThe policy supports SLU staff in the transition to open science by expressing common principles and assigning responsibilities regarding the management and accessibility of research as well as environmental monitoring and assessment data throughout its entire lifecycle9. It serves as a guide in the development of einfrastructures and support functions and it also aims to ensure that the University complies with relevant legislation and commitments to external stakeholders when it comes to data management. SLU, moreover, has a policy for scientific publishing10 in place, which represents an additional important component in the work to promote open science.\\n\\nThe policy applies only to digital material, both raw and aggregated data, that is produced, processed and used in projects and studies at SLU and that underlies the results, conclusions, and bases for decision-making generated by research as well as environmental monitoring and assessment.\\n[Read more about data definitions]\\n\\nThe policy is supplemented with instructions on SLU’s staff web11.\\n\\n## 3. Basic data management principles at SLU\\n\\nSLU endorses the FAIR data sharing principles12 (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) and considers properly managed, accessible, and reusable data as a valuable and necessary resource for conducting research, teaching and environmental monitoring and assessment of high quality. Data made openly accessible also generates added value in the form of increased utilisation and visibility of SLU\\'s research as well as environmental monitoring and assessment. Good management of data throughout its entire lifecycle13 is a prerequisite for being able to comply with the FAIR data sharing principles to the greatest extent possible.\\n\\n### [Read more about FAIR data]\\n\\nSLU is the governing body for the research as well as environmental monitoring and assessment carried out at the University. The research data generated by researchers and doctoral students in the context of their research constitute public documents14, and the same applies also to environmental monitoring and assessment. This implies that SLU is responsible for ensuring that data from research environmental monitoring and assessment conducted at the University is handled in a legal and secure manner.\\n\\nData generated by research as well as environmental monitoring and assessment at SLU shall:\\n\\nbe managed in accordance with good research practice15,\\n\\nbe managed in accordance with current legislation and agreements (see the following section),\\nbe openly with as few restrictions as possible.\\n\\nAccessible data shall:\\n\\nbe searchable and provided with descriptive metadata enabling others to understand and reuse it, be identifiable, verifiable, and reusable by humans as well as machines.\\n\\n## 4. Legal aspects of research and environmental monitoring and assessment data\\n\\nUnder Swedish law, data cannot be owned in a legal sense. However, its use and handling may be regulated in different ways. It is important to ensure whether and how datasets in question are regulated in the context of both use and accessibility. Any agreements and regulations (listed below) take precedence over the principles of this policy, however, the principles should be taken into account as far as possible when formulating agreements.\\n\\n### 4.1 Regulation of data\\n\\nResearch and environmental monitoring and assessment data managed at SLU may:\\n\\nbe protected by database rights (it is the compilation that is protected, no the individual data),\\nconstitute material protected by copyright or photographic rights (e.g., publications or images),\\nbe regulated contractually as for use and management,\\nbe protected under trade secrets legislation16,\\nbe protected under legislation on geographical information17,\\nbe protected under security protection legislation18.\\ncontain personal data in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)19\\n\\nThese protections or rights may in turn be restricted by provisions within administrative law such as:\\n\\nthe University\\'s obligation to disclose public documents (including electronic documents such as a data file),\\nthe bill on Public Sector Data Accessibility20,\\narchives legislation21.\\n\\n4.2 Agreements on data Where data are regulated by specific agreements (e.g., data host for national\\n\\nPolicy on the management of and open access to research and environmental monitoring and assessment data at SLU environmental monitoring and contract research22), the agreements take precedence over this policy, however not over current legislation. The agreements shall specify the data management responsibilities as well as whether and how the data is to be stored and made accessible and which respective party is responsible for archiving and making data accessible. If ownership is agreed upon, it does not mean that a party owns the data but rather that the party has rights and obligations towards the other parties within the project/study that usually come with ownership (such as the right to use the data in further research or commercially, the right to publish, and archive them, etc.). Confidentiality can also be agreed upon but then binds no one other than the contracting parties. The principle of public access to official documents cannot be waived, and should there be no basis for confidentiality according to the Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act23 then the data must be disclosed upon request. To the extent that a funder imposes requirements on how data within a project or study should be stored and made openly available, the funder\\'s requirements shall be followed, provided that Swedish legislation is complied with. Should data belong to another organisation, such as a private company or a public authority in another country, access may be restricted or blocked. In such cases, it is important that an agreement governs the accessibility and availability of data during the project.\\n\\n[Read more about legal aspects in connection to data]\\n\\n## 5. Applying the principles in projects and studies\\n\\nThe life-cycle of research and environmental monitoring and assessment data24 includes planning, collecting, documenting, processing, storing, making accessible and archiving of data. Future (re)use of the material is facilitated by a structured way of working and by making the information comprehensible at all stages. The aim is to make data easy to find and interpret, both now and in the future, to facilitate continuity within projects and studies and to enable validation, sharing, and re-use of data.\\n\\nProjects and studies at SLU vary greatly in nature and scope. This policy describes principles but does not intend to regulate what data shall be made accessible, in what form (raw data, processed data, aggregated data), or at what time. This must be considered in relation to the given circumstances of a project, and it is up to the data producer to make this type of assessment, preferably in consultation with the support functions available at the University. The content of the data management plan (see below) is a starting point for these decisions.\\n\\n### 5.1 Data management plans\\n\\nA data management plan25 must be drawn up, registered, and then maintained over time for each new project and/or study in research and environmental monitoring and assessment at SLU. The data management plan is based on a template26,\\n\\nPolicy on the management of and open access to research and environmental monitoring and assessment data at SLU addressing various aspects of data management during the implementation of the project. The plan describes the managing of data, including archiving and making it available27, in a systematic way. A well-thought-out data management plan can, thus, facilitate compliance with the principles described in this policy.\\n\\nThe data management plan template recommended by SLU includes:\\n\\ndata description (what data will be collected/generated and how), data documentation and data quality,\\ndata storage and data backup,\\nlegal and ethical aspects,\\ndata sharing and long-term preservation\\nresponsibilities and resources.\\n\\nTo reflect changes over time, the plan shall be updated on a regular basis as long as the project or study is ongoing. The plan shall, among other things, state who assumes overall responsibility for managing the data generated28. The plan shall, furthermore, illustrate how the management of data in accordance with current legislation and good research practice29 is ensured, and it must be clear when, how and where the data will be made accessible. The content of the data management plan can be discussed with SLU\\'s support units in order to identify the aspects that are relevant to be highlighted in the plan.\\n\\n[Read more about the data management plans]\\n\\n### 5.2 Storage\\n\\nStorage refers to the storage of data both during ongoing activities and prior to making data accessible and archiving. Data together with associated metadata and potential other documentation must be stored in a secure manner. They shall be protected from unauthorised access and loss, independent of whether or not the data are to be made publicly accessible. Computers and storage media that are not regularly backed up shall not be used for primary data storage in research projects and environmental monitoring and assessment studies. In order to be able to use a cloud service for storing personal data, there must be a data processing agreement with the supplier of the service. Cloud services may not be used for storing or processing sensitive personal data. Remember not to store personal data in a third country (third countries are usually outside the EU/EEA area).\\n\\n[Read more about data storage]\\n\\n### 5.3 Information security\\n\\nInformation security is about providing and maintaining appropriate protection of information. Information in all forms shall be protected according to the aspects of confidentiality, correctness, and accessibility, so in that the right person gains access to the right information at the right time. Technical and organisational security measures shall be appropriate and adapted to the information\\'s level of\\n\\nPolicy on the management of and open access to research and environmental monitoring and assessment data at SLU protection. Special attention is required, for example, regarding personal data that is regulated by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)30 or information that is classified with regard to national security31. Data producers shall ensure that research and environmental monitoring and assessment data is protected, classified32 and risk assessed and that information security and data protection are followed in accordance with legislation, good research practice, and the University\\'s regulations33 and instructions34. The overall responsibility for this lies with the head of department or equivalent.\\n\\n[Read more about information security]\\n\\n### 5.4 Accessibility\\n\\n#### Where and how?\\n\\nOne way to make data accessible for reuse is to upload and describe data files in, preferably certified, data catalogues (repositories) where data is accessible via the web35. Data generated at SLU should, as far as possible, be made openly accessible in data catalogues that provide data with a persistent identifier (PID) 36 in order to, among other things, facilitate proper citation of data. So as to comply with the FAIR data sharing principles, SLU offers support in reviewing and improving metadata and data when making it accessible and depositing, both in data catalogues37 and other commonly existing solutions utilised in research as well as environmental monitoring and assessment at SLU.\\n\\nIn data catalogues, the data licence can often be specified in the metadata. By means of licences users become aware of the purposes for which data may be used and the conditions for further sharing. Licensing is an important component of meeting the FAIR data sharing principles. However, principles for licensing data by SLU are not included in this version of the policy due to ongoing national discussions on this issue.\\n\\n[Read more about data licensing]\\n\\n#### When?\\n\\nData must be made available according to the principle \"as early as possible, as late as necessary\", based on the conditions of the project or study. Within environmental monitoring and assessment, each study must consider when it is appropriate to make data available, since much data collection continues over time without a cut-off date. Even in time-limited projects, especially should such run over a longer period of time, reasons may exist to make subsets of data accessible already during the course of the project.\\n\\nEmbargoes may arise between project completion or publication of research results and the time when data may be made accessible. This may, for example, be due to the data being a trade secret in which case the timing of making data available\\n\\nPolicy on the management of and open access to research and environmental monitoring and assessment data at SLU\\n\\nshould be regulated by contract.\\n\\n#### Restricted access\\n\\nCertain types of data may not be made openly accessible due to restrictions such as confidentiality or personal data. In such cases, metadata should still be made available if possible. Should even the publication of metadata be deemed unsuitable with regard to national or information security in general, then publication shall be avoided. Such an assessment can be made in consultation with SLU\\'s support functions.\\n\\n[Read more about accessibility]\\n\\n### 5.5 Archiving\\n\\nResearch and environmental monitoring and assessment data generated at SLU are considered official documents and are subject to the constitutional principle of public access to official records38. Thus, data must be, as a rule, released upon request and preserved in SLU\\'s archives. Copyright applies to the results of research recorded in a work (e.g., a scientific publication). Primary data must be archived and preserved in order to make such research results verifiable. Laws and regulations govern whether confidentiality can be invoked or whether documents can be disposed of after a certain time.39 Archiving of research and environmental monitoring and assessment data requires that the data is well documented, reliable, and readable. The archiving requirements are in many ways consistent with what is needed for information security and making data accessible, yet preserving documents is not the same as storing or making data accessible. Prior to and during projects and studies that generate data, those responsible must decide what applies to, for example, confidentiality and disposal deadlines, preferably in a data management plan. Data must be archived at the latest at the end of a project or study.\\n\\n[Read more about data archiving]\\n\\n## 6. Roles and responsibilities\\n\\n6.1 Staff engaged in research and environmental monitoring and assessment The person responsible for a study always has primary responsibility for his or her own activities and must ensure that good research practice, current legislation, and established procedures are followed. This responsibility also includes good and appropriate data management. Should a student carry out an independent project within the framework of an ongoing research project, the project manager of the research project is responsible for the necessary management of collected data.40\\n\\nFor all projects or studies carried out at SLU, a data controller must be appointed and named in the data management plan. In most cases, it is appropriate for the project’s Project Manager (PI) or equivalent to be the data controller, however the role may also be assigned to someone else. Though, the data controller shall be distinguished from the person responsible for the data-managing infrastructure. The data controller has overall responsibility for the management of data within a project or study (as defined below) but not necessarily for the technology or infrastructure deployed in the process.\\n\\n### The data controller shall\\n\\nensure good and appropriate management of data in accordance with the principles of this policy,\\nassure that agreements regarding responsibility and data management are drawn up where necessary, particularly in cases where researchers from several organisations collaborate on a project, during collaboration with industry representatives, during contract research, and towards external clients for data hosting.\\n\\nShould the data controller leave SLU or is unable to fulfil his/her duties for any other reason, formal responsibility is transferred to the head of the department where the project is based, unless another person is appointed. Should data from research or environmental monitoring and assessment be handed over to another part of SLU, responsibility is transferred to that part of the organisation. A researcher, or a person engaged in environmental monitoring and assessment, who terminates his/her employment at the University is responsible for handing over the data is to the department for further use and subsequent archiving at the latest at the end of his/her employment, as well as for maintaining a dialogue with the support functions regarding making the data accessible. Data produced as part of projects or studies conducted at SLU must be kept at the University, even if the responsible personnel change their place of work.\\n\\n### 6.2 Heads of department or equivalent\\n\\nIn accordance with the vice-chancellor\\'s delegation of authority41, the head of department is responsible for ensuring that education, research, as well as environmental monitoring and assessment of the highest quality are carried out within the department\\'s area of expertise and within the means available.\\n\\n### The head of department shall\\n\\nassume overall responsibility that data management at the respective department complies with the principles of this policy, assume overall responsibility, as information owner, that information, including research as well as environmental monitoring and assessment data, is protected, classified and risk assessed according to information security guidelines42.\\n\\n### 6.3 University\\n\\nAs the governing body for research as well as environmental monitoring and assessment, SLU has the overall responsibility for ensuring that research and environmental monitoring and assessment data are managed lawfully, correctly and securely, and in accordance with good research practice. In many parts, support functions and infrastructure are in place to enable compliance with the policy, either internally or via external structures, yet continuous development is required.\\n\\n### The University shall\\n\\ncontinuously develop the necessary e-infrastructure and appropriate support functions for good data management,\\nprovide training and guidance on data management, documentation, storage, archiving, and making data accessible.\\n\\nFor support and questions regarding all aspects of data management, contact SLU\\'s Data Management Support (DMS; dms@slu.se), which can, if needed, rally expertise from other support functions such as IT department, Legal Affairs, Data Protection, and Archives/Registry.\\n\\n## 7. Resources for data management\\n\\nManaging research and environmental monitoring and assessment data in accordance with the principles of the policy requires time and resources at several levels. Costs directly related to data management within an externally funded project should be included in the project application to the funder (e.g., time, personnel, or software). Regarding assignments within environmental monitoring and assessment or contract research, data management costs should be specified in the contracts and agreements with the client.\\n\\n## 8.

       " '# Guidelines on Digital Research Data at TU Darmstadt\\n\\nTranslation of the official German text „Leitlinien zum Umgang mit digitalen Forschungsdaten an der TU Darmstadt“\\n\\nfrom December 12th 2015, revised on September 8th 2022\\n\\n## Preamble\\n\\nThe Technical University of Darmstadt (TUDa) considers the responsible and scientifically appropriate handling of research data to be an essential contribution to the acquisition and dissemination of scientific knowledge as an implementation of its principles for ensuring good scientific practice. In line with the institutional goals of sustainability and digitization, it promotes and supports the preservation and documentation of research data as well as structured and free access to them in accordance with the FAIR principles with the aim of increasing the findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability of research data. The guidelines for handling digital research data apply to all research projects at TU Darmstadt, including student work.\\n\\nTraceability and scientific verifiability of research as well as the best possible scientific use of the data obtained are equally important goals. When implementing research data management, the guidelines take into account the specific characteristics of the various disciplines. The implementation of the guidelines should not restrict the commercial exploitation of research results.\\n\\nThe implementation of the guidelines is accompanied by the central working group TUdata, which provides technical, organizational and legal advice on all areas of research data management and supports the members of TUDa with a broad service portfolio and recommendations for action. To this end, TUDa cooperates with other scientific institutions, participates in the National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI) and uses common standards and structures.\\n\\n## Definitions\\n\\n1. Research data are all digital data that are created by transformation from an analogue medium or in the course of experiments, measurements, simulations, computer program development, studies of primary sources, surveys or inquiries or are their result. Associated with them are also the metadata, documentation, and software necessary to understand them. Research data exists in a variety of digital formats and stages of processing and aggregation in every scientific discipline.\\n2. Research data management is understood to refer to the entire handling of digital data in research, from the planning of its generation, through its organization, use and processing in research projects, to its selection and permanent archiving or even deletion, with the aim of achieving the aforementioned goals. This includes, in particular, the discipline-specific documentation of its creation in digital form, the secure storage, the appropriate processing and, if applicable, the publication in a suitable form.\\n\\n## Guidelines\\n\\n1.\\t The planning and execution of a research project also include research data management. This concerns, for example, the type of data generated and used in the course of the project, information on the required accuracy and scope of the data and metadata to be collected, measures to maintain the integrity and authenticity of the data, as well as information on confidentiality, retention and planned publication, including clarification of intellectual property rights and rights of use. These aspects should be systematically prepared and recorded in a suitable form (data management plan). Subject-specific characteristics and standards must be taken into account and the data management plan must be adapted in line with the current progress of the project.\\n\\n2.\\t The leaders of a research project are responsible for the management of all resulting research data during its entire duration. In consultation with the researchers involved, they decide on the selection of research data to be archived and the time, place and conditions of its archiving and, if applicable, its publication. In particular, all project participants are obliged to ensure compliance with good scientific practice and long-term archiving, as well as to implement the relevant requirements of the research funders and partners. In doing so, they take ethical, data protection and copyright aspects into account.\\n\\n3. Research data must be archived to the extent and for the periods specified in the Guidelines for Safeguarding Good Scientific Practice (usually at least ten years). As a rule, this archiving should take place in a recognized discipline-specific research data repository1 or in the institutional repository of TUDa (TUdatalib2). If there are reasons why archiving at the above-mentioned locations is not possible, an archiving solution should be chosen that ensures a similar level of long-term integrity preservation, accessibility and findability of the data. If the data volume of the research data to be stored is too high for complete archiving, a selection will be made according to the aspects of traceability, reproducibility and reusability.\\n\\n4. In order to ensure the traceability and reproducibility of research results, research data should be published at an appropriate time and to an appropriate extent, unless other regulations (e.g. contracts in commissioned research or data protection law) or a planned commercial exploitation prevent this. In order to ensure their reusability and in accordance with the Open Access Policy of the TU Darmstadt,3 published research data should be assigned as open a license as possible. To implement the FAIR principles, the metadata describing the research data must be published to an appropriate extent.\\n\\n5.\\t The source code of self-developed research software, which was created at the TU Darmstadt, shall be made publicly available, provided that the research data generated with it can only be understood with it and no other reasons contradict a publication.\\n\\n6. All research groups at TUDa strive to be up to date with regard to the rules, standards and recommendations for research data management that apply to their discipline. To this end, they appoint a scientific staff member as RDM officer who actively follows developments and supports the group members in research data management. The development of subjet-specific recommendations at the appropriate level (departments, institutes, etc.) is recommended.\\n\\nAn RDM officer can also be appointed for several methodologically or disciplinary related disciplines. The RDM officers exchange information with each other at the appropriate level (at least in the department). TUdata supports the RDM officers and their networking.\\n\\n7. When applying for external funding, the departments check what effort research data management will require in the project and what opportunities exist to raise corresponding funds from the funding agency.\\n\\n8. Data literacy is a prerequisite for efficient and sustainable handling of research data and for compliance with good scientific practice. The methods of subject-specific research data management should therefore be appropriately anchored in teaching and continuing education. Due to the outstanding importance of today’s students for tomorrow’s science, the TU Darmstadt advocates the idea of “good research data management from the very beginning” and, in addition to teaching the theoretical basics at an early stage, strives for the continuous and practical application of the methods and tools in student internships and thesis projects.\\n\\nThese guidelines were adopted by the Executive Board of the Technical University of Darmstadt on September 8th 2022 and become effective immediately.\\n\\nThese guidelines are regularly reviewed by the central institutions and committees involved to ensure that they are up to date and can be adapted to new requirements, infrastructural developments and the needs of researchers. Compliance with legal and regulatory standards (including data protection regulations) is checked regularly.\\n\\nContact for questions regarding the guidelines is the TUdata team (www.tu-darmstadt.de/ tudata).',\n",

Policy process and contact information .. .10\\n\\n### 1. Preamble\\n\\nThe Technical University of Denmark (DTU) is internationally recognized for its elite polytechnic research. DTU's management and digitization of facilities, functions and research data must support that all research units at DTU appear trustworthy, with high integrity and with a focus on both transparency and accountability. Responsible conduct of research includes proper management of research data. Proper management of research data is characterised by following relevant guidelines and legislation, securing resources for collection, processing, analysis and documentation of data, and by planning storage and sharing throughout the data life cycle. DTU supports the National Strategy for data management based on the FAIR principles 2021. Research data management according to the FAIR principles1 ensures that data are findable, accessible, interoperable and\\n\\n#\\n\\nreusable. Hence, proper research data management enables research to be more efficient and open.\\nFor the individual researcher, good data management can lead to improved visibility and impact of their research, for example by facilitating the reuse of their data and by securing\\ntransparency of the research process.\\n\\n#### 1.1 Purpose\\n\\nThe intention of the policy is to support departments, researchers and research support staff by outlining the requirements for the management of research data and enable researchers and students to follow good scientific practice within their discipline, while adhering to national laws and policies applicable to research data. Research data management is the practise of how to handle research data during planning and executing the research project, as well as beyond the life of the research project. DTU is committed to the highest standards of excellence in research and will support the competences necessary to adhere to this policy through infrastructure integration, training, support, guidelines and tools for research data management,\\n\\n#### 1.2 Scope\\n\\nThis policy applies to staff, students, visiting researchers and honorary and adjunct appointees undertaking or supporting research activities at all DTU locations as well as external research locations.\\n\\nThis policy applies to research data that has been created, collected and/or used during DTU research activities, including materials, records and datasets, held in all forms, formats and media.\\n\\n#### 1.3 Definitions\\n\\nResearch data is the material, records, files, and other evidence underpinning the research projects’ findings, or other outcomes. This includes:\\n\\nPrimary material is any material (e.g., specimens, laboratory notebooks, interviews, texts and literature, digital raw data, recordings and any other records including computer code necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of reported results of research, and the events and processes leading to those results) that forms the basis of the research. Data are detailed records of the primary materials that comprise the basis for the analysis that generates the results.\\n\\n#\\n\\n## 2. General principles\\n\\n### 2.1 Data Management Plans (DMP)\\n\\n2.1.1 The management of research data must be thoroughly considered before physical materials and digital data are collected, created or reused. Data management plans (DMPs) must be developed and documented, preferably in electronic formats. As a minimum, the topics addressed in this policy must be reviewed, for example by using the DTU DMP templates. DMP’s should be updated when significant changes to the management of research data occur and (references to) the DMP should be stored with the corresponding research data as long as they exist.\\n\\n2.1.2 The DMP should be discussed with project collaborators, research managers and supervisors (if any), ensuring that agreements are reached regarding responsibilities for different research data management activities during and after research projects.\\n\\n### 2.2 Rights to research data2\\n\\n2.2.1 Rights to research data must be clarified at the start of research projects. Unless legislation states otherwise, or agreements have been made to determine otherwise, the following is the default at DTU:\\n\\na. In accordance with the general rules of copyright during employment, researchers hold the copyright to books and articles they publish as a result of research projects carried out at DTU.3\\nb. DTU holds the copyright to software created by employees during the performance of their work.\\nc. DTU holds the rights to research data in the shape of physical materials collected by researchers during their employment at DTU, such as biological, chemical and geological samples, notebooks, paper interviews and books. These objects may not be removed without permission.\\nd. Data sets and associated metadata must remain at DTU when employment ceases. As a minimum, this applies to data sets underlying publications and patent applications (if any). The data must be documented so it is understandable to peers. (See also 2.4.1 and 2.4.2)\\ne. In accordance with the Danish Act on Inventions at Public Research Institutions, DTU has the right to acquire researchers’ inventions and to ask researchers to postpone publication of such inventions for a certain period. This to be agreed in a mutual dialogue between concerned parties.\\n\\nIn addition, the following should be clarified at the start of the project:\\n\\nf. To what extent research data can be accessed in the project. For example, in projects involving personal data, it must be clarified to what extent rules of data confidentiality or\\n\\n#\\n\\nlimitations in data processor agreements impose limits on data access and use, and how these limits will be upheld.\\ng. Who can access and manage the research data, within which timeframe and for what purpose (civil, military or both).\\nh. When and to what extent research data may be used for other purposes, for example in other research projects. It should also be determined what rules apply if a project member leaves the project and/or DTU.\\ni. Whether research data can be shared after project end, and if so, what the terms of data reuse by others will be.\\nj. Intellectual property rights, including whether the research project makes use of material that interferes with the rights of others, and how the necessary approvals should be obtained to clear these rights.\\nk. The legislation, policies or agreements governing the above, including whether there are special loyalty or confidentiality obligations.\\nl. Any research data management requirements by research funders, partner organisations, etc.\\n\\n#### 2.3 Ethical and legal approvals\\n\\n2.3.1 It should be ensured that the appropriate ethical and legal approvals are obtained before the start of data collection and (references to) the approvals should be stored along with the research data, as long as they exist.\\n\\n2.3.2 Strict legal and local requirements exist for projects involving personal data. Among others, projects in which personal data are being processed (including biobanks) must be registered at DTU, the registration must be filed in the University’s archiving system. Certain activities also require the approval from the data protection authorities (e.g. Danish Data Protection Agency). Conditions for transfer of personal data and material between DTU and external collaborators or a third party must be captured into agreements. The local GDPR Coordinator can provide further information.4\\n\\n#### 2.4 Collection, processing and documentation\\n\\n2.4.1 Research data should be collected and processed in line with best practice in the research discipline. Research projects should be documented in a way that allows them to be repeated by others. Among other things, this includes clearly and accurately describing research methodology and any equipment, software or code used.\\n\\n2.4.2 Research data should be described using appropriate metadata to facilitate searching for, the identification of, and the interpretation of the research data. Metadata should be linked to the research data as long as they exist, unless legislation or agreements state otherwise.\\n\\n#\\n\\n#### 2.5 Storage and security\\n\\n2.5.1 Research data must be categorized at the start of a research project based on the level of sensitivity and the impact to the University if data are disclosed, altered or destroyed without authorisation. Risks related to data security and to the data loss should be assessed in relation to the data classification. This includes evaluating:\\n\\na. Physical and digital access to research data\\nb. Risks associated with data management procedures\\nc. Backup requirements and backup procedures\\nd. External and internal threats to data confidentiality, integrity and accessibility\\ne. Financial, regulatory and technical consequences of working with data, data storage and data preservation.\\n\\n2.5.2 Risks to data subjects’ rights and freedom must be assessed in projects involving personal data and a risk assessment must be conducted and recorded when registering projects at DTU. In some cases, with a high risk for the data subjects, a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) must also be carried out as part of the registration process.\\n\\n2.5.3 Infrastructure for storing and processing research data, and for collaborating in research projects, must be chosen in accordance with the identified risks, and in compliance with DTU’s Information Security Policy and the legal requirements for processing personal data.\\n\\n#### 2.6 Data sharing and publication\\n\\n2.6.1 Legislation or agreements may preclude research data sharing or impose conditions for sharing. Before sharing research data, the relevant approvals need to be obtained and, if necessary, the appropriate agreements set up to allow data and material sharing.\\n\\n2.6.2 By default, research data should be made openly available after project end, as a minimum for data sets underlying research publications. Concerns relating to intellectual property rights, personal data protection, information security as well as commercial and national interests and legislation must be taken into account. Thus, data sharing should be in accordance with the principle of ‘as open as possible, as closed as necessary’. If the research data cannot be made available, sharing the metadata associated with the research data must be considered.\\n\\n2.6.3 The FAIR principles (for findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable research objects) should be followed as much as possible when preparing digital data sets. This includes as a minimum:\\n\\n#\\n\\na. Providing open access to data (Open Data) by depositing (meta)data in a data repository, or by providing access to information on whether, when, how, and to what extent data can be accessed if data sets cannot be made openly available.\\nb. As much as possible using persistent identifiers (PID) and metadata (such as descriptive keywords) that help locate the data set.\\nc. Communicating terms and conditions for data reuse by others, for example by attaching a data license.\\nd. Providing the information necessary to understand how data sets were created and structured, and for what purpose. The level of compliance with the FAIR principles, in addition to the minimum requirements described above, is defined by the individual research discipline in relation to international norms and standards in that discipline.\\ne. DTU's general legal entity must be involved as early as possible in the negotiation of all third-party contracts containing provisions on intellectual property rights, such as nondisclosure agreements, material transfer agreements and collaboration agreements. Patentable inventions must be reported to the DTU's general legal entity in accordance with the Act on Inventions at Public Research Institutions.5\\nf. Determining rights, for example, of access to and use of preserved data sets.\\n\\n#### 2.7 Long-term preservation\\n\\n2.7.1 Appropriate arrangements for the long-term preservation of digital data, physical material and associated metadata must be made, adhering to national legislation and/or project agreements. This should include:\\n\\na. Deciding which research data will be preserved. As a minimum, data sets underlying published research results must be preserved so that any objections or criticisms can be addressed.\\nb. Deciding how long research data will be preserved. Data sets underlying research publications should be retained for at least five years after project completion or date of publication, whichever comes last.\\nc. Choosing a format and location in which research data should be preserved and deciding what metadata should be associated with the preserved data and material.\\nd. Deleting/destructing research data if legislation or agreements exclude preservation, or when researchers and their managers determine that preservation is not required (for example when research data can easily be reproduced) or not possible (for example when research data are too costly to store or when material quality will deteriorate over time).\\ne. Appointment of one or more persons or roles as responsible for research data after the end of the project. This includes, among other things, securing the integrity of the data for long term preservation\\nf. Determining rights, for example, of access to and use of preserved data sets.\\n\\n#\\n\\n2.7.2 Data sets and associated metadata must remain at DTU after project end and/or when employment with the University ceases, in a way in which they are accessible to research leaders and understandable for research leaders and peers, unless legislation or agreements determine otherwise. As a minimum, this applies to data sets underlying publications. Responsibilities for and rights to these data sets must be agreed upon.\\n\\n2.7.3 Digital research data must be registered to the Danish National Archives at project end if the research falls within the scope of the Executive Order on the Registration of Digital Research Data #5146. The Danish National Archives assess the data’s potential for long-term preservation. The National Archives may subsequently request a copy of the data to be transferred to the archives. Data in these projects can only be destructed if the National Archives issue a disposal provision after their assessment.\\n\\n2.7.4 Personal data can only be preserved\\n\\na. if anonymized or\\nb. at the Danish National Archives or\\nc. when there is a legal basis for the long-term preservation of personal data in a secure database, biobank or other collection for research purposes.\\n\\n2.7.5 A plan for research data preservation and/or destruction must be developed in alignment with legislation, (local) guidelines and agreements (if any), and the continued need for preservation should be reviewed on a regular basis.\\n\\n## 3.

Definition 6\\n2. Recommendations 6\\n\\n### 1 Preamble\\n\\nTU Wien recognizes the fundamental importance of research data1  and the management of research data and records in maintaining quality research and scientific integrity and is committed to state-of-the-art handling and management of research data. RDM policies are highly valuable to current and future researchers2.\\n\\nTU Wien acknowledges that correct and easily retrievable research data are the foundation of and integral to research. They are necessary to verify and defend the process and results of research. Research data have a long-term value for research and academia, with the potential for widespread use in society.\\n\\n### 2 Scope\\n\\nThis policy for the management of research data applies to all researchers active at TU Wien. The policy was approved by the Rectorate on 03.07.2018. In cases when research is funded by a third party3, any agreements made with that party concerning intellectual property rights (IPR), access rights, exploitation rights and the storage of research data take precedence over this policy.\\n\\n### 3 Rights of use\\n\\nTU Wien holds the right to use all data created or processed in the course of research work at TU Wien for research purposes and commercial exploitation. In cases where a legal entity other than TU Wien has the primary right of use under a contractual arrangement, TU Wien shall be granted the rights of use required to ensure compliance with all applicable legal and contractual provisions. In cases where the IPR belong to TU Wien, TU Wien has the right to choose how to publish and share the research data.\\n\\n### 4 Research data and research data management\\n\\nResearch data refer to all information (regardless of form or presentation) needed to support or validate the development, results, observations or findings of research work, including contextual information. Research data include all materials created in the course of academic work, e.g. through digitisation, records, source research, experiments, measurements, surveys and interviews. This includes software and code.\\n\\nResearch data management spans the entire life cycle of the research data: their planning, generation, analysis, evaluation, archiving, publication and eventual reuse by third parties. Besides documenting the research data, RDM includes specifying – and possibly storing – the equipment and software employed in producing them. Metadata4 should be captured together with the research data during the research process, since they facilitate the identification, interpretation and reuse of research data.\\n\\n### 5 Handling research data\\n\\nResearch data should from the beginning be stored and maintained in appropriate systems and made available for use in a suitable repository (see 6.1. b). Research data must be provided with persistent identifiers5 within the repository.\\n\\nIt is important to preserve the integrity of research data and to comply with the FAIR principles.6 Research data must be stored in a correct, complete, unadulterated, and reliable manner. They must be findable, identifiable, accessible, traceable, interoperable and whenever possible reusable and replicable.\\n\\nIn compliance with intellectual property rights, and unless third-party rights, legal requirements, Rectorate decisions, other reasonable interests or property laws prohibit it, research data should be assigned an open use license.7\\n\\nCitation norms and requirements regarding publication and future research should be followed; data sources should be explicitly traceable in order for the original sources to be acknowledged.\\n\\nResearch data and records are to be stored and made available in accordance with intellectual property laws or the requirements of third-party funders as well as applicable legal or contractual requirements (e.g. EU restrictions on where identifiable personal data may be stored). Research data that may be of future historical interest and the records accompanying them should also be archived.\\n\\nThe minimum retention period for research data and records is 10 years after either the assignment of a persistent identifier or the publication of a related work following research completion, whichever is later.\\n\\nIn the event that research data and records are to be deleted or destroyed, either after expiration of the required retention period or for legal or ethical reasons, such action is to be carried out only after consideration of all legal and ethical perspectives. The following aspects must be taken into consideration when decisions are made about the retention or destruction of research data: interests and contractual provisions of third-party funders and other stakeholders, employees, and partner participants in particular, as well as confidentiality and security. Any decision taken must be documented.\\n\\n### 6 Responsibilities, rights and duties\\n\\nThe responsibilities for research data management during and after research lie with TU Wien and its researchers, who should comply with widely recognized national and international codes for the responsible conduct of research. TU Wien and its researchers should become aware of their responsibilities as follows.\\n\\n#### 6.1 Researchers are responsible for\\n\\na) Managing research data in adherence with the principles and requirements expressed in this policy; this also includes defining responsibilities for joint research;\\nb) Collecting, documenting, storing, archiving, providing access to or ensuring the proper destruction of research data and records;\\nc) Completing and updating data management plans (DMPs) that explicitly define the approach to matters of research data collection, administration, integrity, confidentiality, storage, use and publication;\\n\\nd) Ensuring compliance with\\n\\nall organisational, regulatory, institutional and other contractual and legal requirements with regard to both research data and records,\\nthe “Code of Conduct – Rules to Ensure Good Scientific Practice” (Regeln zur Sicherung guter wissenschaftlicher Praxis),\\nthe “Code of Conduct for third-party gifts”,\\nthe “Richtlinie Datenschutz und Informationssicherheit”;\\n\\ne) Registering new research at the proposal stage in the TISS Project Database in order to ensure appropriate institutional support.\\n\\n#### 6.2 TU Wien is responsible for\\n\\na) Providing the means and resources for research support, ensuring ongoing access to services and infrastructures, and providing employee education and training according to financial possibilities;\\n\\nb) Supporting established scientific practices from the beginning through e.g. DMPs, providing training, education and support for researchers in compliance with regulations, third-party contracts for research grants, university statutes, codes of conduct and other relevant guidelines; encouraging the integration of good practices of research data management in education to strengthen the research data management expertise of early-stage researchers;\\nc) Designing and deploying mechanisms and services for the storage, safekeeping, registration and deposition of research data to support current and future access to research data during and after the completion of research activities;\\nd) According to financial possibilities providing information on, or access to, services and infrastructures for the storage, safekeeping and archiving of research data and records, enabling researchers to exercise their responsibilities (as outlined above) and to comply with obligations to third-party funders or other legal entities;\\ne) Communicating its commitment to the principles of research ethics and scientific integrity and ensuring their implementation at TU Wien; raising awareness of the importance of research data management;\\nf) Ensuring compatibility of this policy with data protection regulations.\\n\\n### 7 Validity\\n\\nThis policy will be reviewed and updated as required by the Rectorate of TU Wien every three years. In case of legal or regulatory changes, the review of this policy can take place at an earlier point in time.\\n\\n### Annex\\n\\n#### 1. Definition\\n\\n1.1. Research is any creative work undertaken on a systematic basis in order to increase the stock of knowledge, including knowledge of man, culture and society, and the use of this stock of knowledge to devise new applications.\\n\\n1.2. Researchers are all members of TU Wien, specifically employees and doctoral candidates, who conduct research.

Preamble. 3\\n2. Scope of Application .. 3\\n3. Legal Aspects .\\n4.Handling Research Data. 4\\n5. Responsibilities 4\\n6. Validity . 5\\nGlossary. . 5\\n\\n### 1. Preamble\\n\\nThe goal of TU Berlin is to further develop science and technology for the benefit of our society. The members of the university are wholly committed to the principle of sustainable development. TU Berlin carries out basic and application-oriented research at top international level and promotes cross-faculty research activities and networks with external actors as well as knowledge and technology transfer between the university and practical applications. To this goal, TU Berlin forms strategic alliances with companies as well as university and non-university research facilities.\\n\\nResearch data is a valuable resource and a basis for scientific knowledge and has a long-term value for research and science, with the potential for widespread use in society. Research data is all information (regardless of form or representation) that arise during a research process or is its result, including the information necessary to verify and reproduce the results. Research data includes measurement data, lab values, audiovisual information, texts, objects from collections or samples, surveys, and interviews, but also notes, time histories/recordings, calculations, software and code. TU Berlin is aware of the fundamental significance of research data for maintaining the quality of research and scientific integrity and is committed to follow recognized standards that meet the highest requirements. TU Berlin acknowledges that correct and easily retrievable research data is the foundation and integral part of every research activity as it is necessary for the verification and reproducibility of research processes and results.\\n\\nWith this policy, TU Berlin wants to provide its current and future researchers with an orientation for handling research data. The policy refers in particular to the recommendations of the German Council of Science and the Humanities (2012)1 and the German Rectors’ Conference (2014)2 as well as to the “Guidelines on the Handling of Research Data” (2015)3 of the German Research Foundation. TU Berlin formulates this policy according to the “Statute on the Safeguarding of Good Academic Practice at TU Berlin”4 and the “Open Access Policy of TU Berlin”5.\\n\\n### 2. Scope of application\\n\\nThis policy on the management of research data principally applies to all researchers active at TU Berlin. Generally, it must also be adhered to when research is conducted with third parties. In exceptional and justified cases, there may be deviations from the policy to enable the research, especially when it comes to agreements with third parties regarding intellectual property rights, access rights, and the storage of research data, provided that the \"Statute on the Safeguarding of Good Academic Practice at TU Berlin\" and their implementation regulations remain unaffected and that they are not contrary to the principles of \"TU Berlin Transfer Strategy\"6, the \"Recommendations for Action Regarding Knowledge and Technology Transfer within the Context of Open Science\"7 and the \"Code of Conduct for Research Involving Commercial Enterprises\"8.\\n\\n### 3. Legal Aspects\\n\\nIntellectual property rights and rights to research data shall be defined through specific agreements (e.g. research contracts such as grant or consortium agreements and contract research agreements). In cases where the rights to the research data belong to TU Berlin, TU Berlin decides how the research data will be published, shared, and reused. If research data belongs to a researcher, the researcher will decide how to proceed with the data.\\n\\nIn research data management, TU Berlin and its researchers observe ethical and legal issues such as data protection and patent law. Priority shall be given to rules on confidentiality.\\n\\n### 4. Handling Research Data\\n\\nMaintaining the integrity of research data is essential: Research data must be stored in a correct, complete, unadulterated, and reliable manner. Furthermore, according to the FAIR principles, research data must also be identifiable, accessible, verifiable, interoperable, and, whenever possible, available for subsequent use.\\n\\nIn accordance with its Open Access Policy, TU Berlin supports open access to research data. In compliance with intellectual property rights and if no third-party rights, data protection rights, and legal or contractual provisions prohibit it, TU Berlin recommends that research data should be assigned a license for open use, such as Creative Commons, to enable the reuse of the research data.\\n\\nResearch data shall be stored in a suitable repository or archive system, shall be assigned a persistent identifier and metadata, and if possible, made openly accessible. The applicable research ethics and data privacy regulations are to be considered.\\n\\nThe minimum storage period for research data is ten years after either the assignment of a persistent identifier or the publication of the related work following research project completion, whichever is later.\\n\\nAdherence to citation rules and requirements regarding publication and future use of the research data must be ensured. When research data is reused, the origin of the data must clearly be verifiable and the original sources must be named.\\n\\nIf research data is to be deleted or destroyed after the expiration period of the storage, this will be carried out only after considering all legal and ethical aspects. When making a decision about the retention and destruction of data, the interests and contractual stipulations of third-party funders and other stakeholders, employees, and partners, as well as the aspects regarding confidentiality and safety must be taken into consideration. Any action must be documented.\\n\\n### 5. Responsibilities\\n\\nThe responsibility for research data management during and after a research project lies with TU Berlin and its researchers and should be compliant with the codes of TU Berlin for responsible conduct of research. The researchers are in particular responsible for:\\n\\na) Management of research data in adherence with the principles and requirements laid out in this policy. This includes specifications made by the principal investigator regarding the handling of research data in the framework of projects;\\nb) Collection, documentation, access to, and storage or proper destruction of research data and research-related records;\\nc) Planning to enable the continued use of data even after the completion of a research project. This includes defining usage rights, with the assignation of appropriate licenses. This also includes the clarification of data storage and archiving if the researcher leaves TU Berlin;\\n\\nd) Creation and updating of Data Management Plans that explicitely define the collection, administration, integrity, confidentiality, storage, use, and publication of the research data\\n\\nTU Berlin commits itself to creating the conditions which enable the fulfillment of the principles laid out in this policy.\\n\\n### 6. Validity\\n\\nThe Research Data Policy of TU Berlin was adopted by the Academic Senate on 23 October 2019 and will be continued by resolution of the Academic Senate of 15 March 2023. The policy will be reviewed by the university library within the framework of the Service Center Research Data Management every three years or when needed and will be introduced to the Academic Senate for resolution by the member of the Executive Board responsible for research.\\n\\n## Glossary\\n\\nContract research is scientific research carried out on behalf of a private or public funding organization. The task is predefined and the rights to the research results generally belong to the principal, whereby the University is granted a non-exclusive right of use for the purpose of research and teaching.\\n\\nA data management plan (DMP) is a structured guideline on how to handle research data both during and after a research project. It documents the process how the research data is generated and how it is stored appropriately so that it can be interpreted and verified, and remains available, authentic, citable, and reusable in later years. To this end, clearly defined legal parameters and appropriate security measures (such as contracts and licenses) shall also be included in the DMP. To optimize research data management and as a basis for institutional support, a DMP should be created before the start of a research project and updated in the course of the project.\\n\\nA repository is a storage platform for the archiving and worldwide publication of scientific publications, research data, or cultural heritage data. Storage of research results in a repository ensures that they are sustainably accessible, verifiable, citable, and reusable.\\n\\nThe FAIR principles are international principles for sustainably reusable research data. The main objective of the principles is to ensure that research data is optimally prepared so that it is findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. The FAIR principles were created and first published in 2016 by a broad-based interest group consisting of representatives from science, industry, funding organizations, and scientific publishers.9\\n\\nResearchers include all members of TU Berlin active in research including employees and doctoral candidates. People who are not directly connected with TU Berlin but use its infrastructure or are physically present at the University for research purposes are included in this term. Visiting researchers and external cooperative partners are expected to comply with the Research Data Policy.\\n\\nResearch Data Management (RDM) encompasses all measures for the quality assurance of research data with regard to storage, access, and preservation of research data in order to make research results sustainably reproducible and available for reuse. The activities cover the entire research data lifecycle, starting with the planning and execution of the research project, through the creation and storing of data to the long-term storage of the results after the research project is completed. Specific tasks in RDM include quality control and quality assurance, documentation, metadata creation, archiving, data exchange and reuse as well as measures for data integrity and data security.\\n\\nCooperative research is cooperation on equal terms between partners pursuing a common goal. In principle, the rights to the results belong to the partner who developed them.\\n\\nA licence for free use (or free license) is a standardized license agreement which allows research data to be reused. It regulates which rights of use the author/originator grants to the general public that go beyond the applicable copyright law. Depending on the data type, a license is selected. Established free licenses in software are the GNU General Public License (GPL), the MIT license, or the Apache license. Creative Common licenses (CC) apply to texts, images, music and videos.\\n\\nMetadata is data about data. It is data which provides descriptive or contextual information about other data, can be indexed, and facilitates archiving and retrieval. There are different types or categories of metadata. Metadata in a repository, for example, can be classified in four types of content: bibliographic metadata (e.g. title, author, abstract), structural metadata (relationships between and within objects, e.g. links, references), administrative metadata (authorizations/status, e.g. access rights, embargo), technical metadata (data evaluated by the system, e.g. size of files, checksums, modification date).\\n\\nA persistent identifier is a constant Internet address for digital objects. It guarantees that a dataset remains permanently findable, accessible, and citable, even if its physical location changes. Well known examples are DOI (digital object identifier) or URN (uniform resource name).',\n",

If there are any differences in the wording, meaning, or interpretation of the German and English versions, the German version shall prevail.\\n\\n# Guidelines for Handling Research Data at Technische Universität Braunschweig\\n\\n## Preamble\\n\\nResearch data are data that are collected as part of scientific projects, e.g. through observations, experiments, simulation calculations, surveys, researching sources, recordings, digitalisation or analyses.1 They are both the basis for scientific work and its results. Responsible management of research data and the software that creates this data serves to ensure that the research can be reproduced and validated, and in some cases enables the research data to be used again. Technische Universität Braunschweig supports its researchers in implementing quality-conscious data management for the purpose of ensuring good scientific practice and to promote more transparency in their research.\\n\\n# Principles\\n\\n1) The researching members of Technische Universität Braunschweig are responsible for deciding which data is worth being archived and published as well as for documenting, providing and long-term archiving of the research data. By saving and archiving the data in a recognised repository, researchers fulfil their requirement to adhere to good scientific practice (archiving for at least\\n10 years).\\n2) When managing research data, researchers ensure they adhere to ethical, data security, copyright or confidentiality principles.\\n3) We recommend making research data and research software publicly available with an academic publication according to Technische Universität Braunschweig's open access guidelines.3 For this, it is recommended that researchers choose an open licence (e.g. Creative Commons) to make it easier for fellow researchers to use the data. This is done under consideration of requirements set by the research project's funding organisations and partners. FAIR Data Principles4 as well as software and data citation principles5 must be upheld.\\n\\nThis is a courtesy translation. If there are any differences in the wording, meaning, or interpretation of the German and English versions, the German version shall prevail.\\n\\nTechnische Universität Braunschweig\\n\\nGuidelines for Handling Research Data at Technische Universität Braunschweig\\n\\n4) For saving the results of research projects, Technische Universität Braunschweig recommends planning research data management in the initial project planning phases, or when writing a grant application and creating a research data management plan at an early point in time. A data management plan documents how data is to be gathered, processed and saved from obtaining data to publication.\\n\\nTechnische Universität Braunschweig commits to creating requirements necessary to fulfil these principles and, with its central infrastructure institutions — a cooperation among the Research Service and European Office, Gauß-IT-Zentrum and the University Library, to support researchers with appropriate measures for infrastructure, advising and continuing education.\\n\\n## Contact:\\n\\nforschungsdaten@tu-braunschweig.de\",\n",
       " \"# Technische Universität Dresden\\n\\n## Guidelines on the handling of research data at TU Dresden\\n\\nThese Guidelines have been adopted by the Senate of Technische Universität Dresden in its meeting on 13th June 2018.\\n\\n### Preamble\\n\\nThe transparency of research is a key component of good scientific practice. It includes the responsible handling of research data as both the basis for one's own scientific research and the basis for further research - irrespective of the original purpose of data collection.\\n\\nIn its 'Guidelines for Safeguarding Good Scientific Practice, Avoiding Scientific Misconduct and Dealing with Violations' (version of 5th March 2014), TU Dresden has stipulated guidelines for the handling of primary data in § 5. For the implementation of these guidelines and the handling of research data in general (i.e. beyond primary data), TU Dresden has adopted the following specific guidelines for the handling of research data.\\n\\n#### What is research data?\\n\\nResearch data refers to all data collected, observed, derived, simulated or otherwise generated in connection with research. Research data is present in any scientific discipline in different forms and formats.\\n\\n### Guidelines\\n\\n1. Responsible research goes hand in hand with the conscious and careful handling of research data throughout its entire life cycle, as formulated by the German Research Foundation (DFG) in its 'Guidelines on the Handling of Research Data'. Research data management involves the planning, collection, processing, documentation, publication, and long-term storage of data.\\n2. The responsibility for the research data management lies with the project leaders as well as the independent researchers. The structural units (Schools, Faculties or Institutes) can define binding rules for their areas of responsibility.\\n3. For projects involving research data, a data management plan that documents the handling of research data should be established right at the project conception or application stage, based on general and subject-specific guidelines (e.g. of the funding bodies or professional associations).\\n4. TU Dresden supports its researchers in the management of their research data through the Service Center Research Data (Kontaktstelle Forschungsdaten), which is jointly operated by the ZIH and the SLUB. It offers advice regarding the development of concepts as well as assistance providing tools for research data management. To optimally benefit from this service, early contact prior to or at the beginning of a project is recommended.\\n5. TU Dresden provides a basic research data infrastructure, ensuring appropriate storage and the technical availability of digital research data.\\n6. TU Dresden promotes and supports Open Access to research data. This is good scientific practice and of great importance for both the optimal exploitation of research results and the quality of research. The decision for any publication and its legal conditions is the individual researcher’s responsibility. The protection of personal data, ethical and copyright issues, obligations towards third parties, and exploitation interests should be given balanced consideration.\\n7. In order to provide and re-use the data, the data as well as its context of origin and the tools used must be documented.\\n8. Research data which forms the basis of a publication should be archived for the long-term in a suitable, trustworthy data archive or repository and/or published in a suitable form. It is an integral part of the researchers' scientific reputation.\\n9. In order to sustainably establish and advance a high-quality research data management, its principles and methods should be anchored in teaching and continuing education.\",\n",

It supports the principles of the Concordat on Open Research Data1 which state that ‘research data should, wherever possible be made openly available for use by others in a manner consistent with relevant legal, ethical, disciplinary and regulatory frameworks and norms’.\\n\\n1.3 To embed good practice in research and ensure research data are easily accessible, the University has developed this Research Data Management Policy in accordance with The Concordat on Open Research Data, Funder requirements, and best practice for research data management as set out in the LEARN2 Toolkit.\\n\\n1.4 The University’s position on related issues is set out in its policies for Open Access, Data Protection, Research Ethics, Freedom of Information and Information Security.\\n\\n## 2 Scope\\n\\nThis policy applies to all staff and students involved in the creation, collection and curation of research data at Teesside University; and all data generated or processed as part of research for which the University is responsible.\\n\\n## 3. Definitions\\n\\nResearch is any creative and systematically performed work with the goal of furthering knowledge, including discoveries regarding people, culture and society, in addition to the use of such knowledge for new applications.\\n\\n3.2 Researchers refers to all research-active members of an institution including employees and doctoral candidates. Persons not directly affiliated with an institution, but who, for purposes of research, make use of or are physically present at the institution, are also included in the term. Visiting researchers or collaborators may also be expected to comply with the policy.\\n\\n3.3 Research data refers to all information (independent of form or presentation) needed to support or validate the development, results, observations or findings of a research project, including contextual information. Research data include all materials which are created in the course of academic work, including digitisation, records, source research, experiments, measurements, surveys and interviews. This includes software and code. Research data can take on several forms during the lifespan of a research project. Data can exist as gradations of raw data, processed data (including negative and inconclusive results), published data and Open Access published data, and with varying levels of access, including open data, restricted data and closed data.\\n\\n## 4 Planning\\n\\nAll new research projects should include a research data management plan (DMP) which details approaches to the capture, management, integrity, confidentiality, retention, ownership, sharing and publication of research data. Compliance with relevant legal and ethical frameworks and funder requirements where relevant should be ensured.  A DMP must be developed where specified by a funder, sponsor or other relevant stakeholder, and is strongly encouraged as best practice for all projects.\\n\\nThe University provides access to an online tool3 which can be used to create Data Management Plans if another tool, such as one provided by a funder, is not being used.\\n\\n## 5 Storage and Management\\n\\nResearch data should be stored and made available for use in a suitable repository or archiving system and provided with persistent identifiers. Research data should be stored on the University’s research data repository4, or a record should be created in the repository with a link to a suitable external repository, for example if it is felt that an external discipline-specific policy would give a dataset enhanced visibility or when the use of an external repository is required by an external funder.\\n\\n5.2 It is important to preserve the integrity of research data and they must be stored in a correct reliable manner. Data storage should follow FAIR data principles5 and must be identifiable, accessible, traceable, interoperable, and whenever possible, available for subsequent use.\\n\\n5.3 Non-digital research data should be stored in a form that would allow for sharing and access if required. The fact that research data is non-digital does not provide a sufficient reason for restricting access.\\n\\n5.4 Research data must be assigned a licence for open use, in compliance with intellectual property rights, if no third-party rights, legal requirements or property laws prohibit it.\\n\\n## 6 Retention\\n\\nResearch data and records are to be stored and made available in accordance with the research data management plan, relevant\\n\\nintellectual property laws, and/or the requirements of third-party funders, within the parameters of applicable legal or contractual requirements.\\n\\n6.2 The minimum archive duration for research data and records should be determined by best practice, discipline norms and stakeholder requirements where relevant.  In the absence of these, a general guideline is that data should be retained for 10 years after either the assignment of a persistent identifier or publication of related research results, whichever is later.\\n\\n## 7 Disposal\\n\\nResearch data should be disposed of securely, in accordance with the DMP and the University’s Information Security Policy.  The timing of data disposal should reflect any ethical, contractual and legal requirements, and current best practice.\\n\\n## Responsibilities, rights and duties\\n\\n8.1 Researchers are responsible for:\\n\\nThe development of the DMP.  Support is available from the Library and Research and Enterprise Office.\\n\\nManagement of research data and data sets in conjunction with the principles and requirements expressed in this policy.\\n\\nPlanning for the curation and management of research data and related records, as reflected in the DMP\\n\\nCompliance with the requirements of research funders; requirements for specific projects should be described in the DMP. When applying for funding, researchers must ensure that adequate resources to cover the costs associated with data management are requested where possible.\\n\\nThe most senior researcher associated with a research project (funded or unfunded) is the Data Lead and is ultimately responsible for research data management associated with the project.\\n\\no For funded projects this will be the Principal Investigator o For PGR students this will the Director of Studies.\\n\\nThe Data Lead must ensure that all researchers working on the project are aware of the requirements of this policy.\\n\\nIf a researcher leaves the University, they should inform the Data Lead of any data they hold relating to a research project and arrange for the data to be made available to the Data Lead.  If the Data Lead leaves the University, they should discuss the research data they hold with their line manager or Associate Dean (Research and Innovation) and ensure that appropriate decisions are taken on the management of the research data.  This may include ensuring that funder requirements are met.\\n\\n8.2 Teesside University is responsible for:\\n\\nDeveloping and providing mechanisms, services and infrastructure for the registration, storage, curation, and deposit of research data.\\nSupporting the drafting, costing and provision of DMPs\\nRaising awareness of and providing support in meeting the\\nprinciples set out in the policy.',\n",

Such data may be in any form, but may include “digital information created directly from research activities such as experiments, analysis, surveys, measurements, instrumentation and observations; data resulting from automated or manual data reduction and analysis including the inputs and outputs of simulations and models”2.\\n\\nThis policy defines the standards that govern the management of research data at the Open University.\\n\\nResearch data management (RDM) is a recognised part of the research process and scholarly communications. Formal requirements and expectations from funders, publishers, collaborators and institutions (for example Data Management Plans and data sharing) exist and are likely to continue to evolve. There are benefits to the researcher, the University and the research community when research data is well managed, preserved and, where appropriate, made publicly available.\\n\\nFor specific guidance on how this policy may relate to your personal circumstances, please contact the Library Research Support team library-research-support@open.ac.uk.\\n\\n# Policy\\n\\n## 1. Purpose\\n\\nThe purpose of this policy is to identify the Open University’s position with regard to the management of research data and to outline the responsibilities and requirements of the University and its researchers.\\n\\n1.1. The objectives of this policy are:\\n\\n1.1.1. To set out the University’s requirements for research data management.\\n\\n1.1.2. To inform all OU research staff and students, OU research support staff, those we work with, and the public of how research data is managed at the OU.\\n\\n1.1.3. To provide OU researchers and support staff with references to guidance of how to manage research data.\\n\\n## 2. Policy principles\\n\\nThe Open University is committed to the UKRI/RCUK Common Principles on Data Policy3 and the FAIR Data Principles4 and believes that the open sharing of data, wherever possible, is a public good.\\n\\nIn keeping with OU principles of openness, it is expected that research data will be open and accessible to other researchers, as soon as appropriate and verifiable, subject to the application of appropriate safeguards relating to the sensitivity of the data and legal and commercial requirements. Research data must be managed to the highest standards throughout their lifecycle in order to support excellence in research practice.\\n\\n## 3. Responsibilities\\n\\n### 3.1 Researcher responsibilities\\n\\nAll those engaged in research at the OU, including those involved in collaborating with other institutions, must take personal responsibility for managing research data in accordance with University and funder requirements.\\n\\nResearchers are expected to write a Data Management Plan before data collection begins which sets out how research data will be managed, shared, and preserved.\\n\\nResearchers are expected to share research data as openly as possible, where ethical, legal, or commercial considerations allow.\\n\\nWhere research data are shared in a repository, metadata should be assigned to ensure the data are findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable, in accordance with the FAIR Data Principles.\\n\\nIt is the responsibility of the individual researcher to ensure that all research data that support and substantiate published research findings are offered to an appropriate repository for long term storage, discovery and public access, where permitted. This may be funder or discipline specific, or Open Research Data Online (ORDO), the OU’s institutional research data repository.\\n\\nWhere supporting research data are physical, the researcher must create a research data catalogue record in ORDO so that other researchers may find and then request access to supporting research data.\\n\\n### 3.2 University responsibilities\\n\\nThe University will engage with funders, policy makers and other stakeholders to ensure that research data management policies and services evolve in line with sector requirements.\\n\\nIt is the responsibility of executive Deans or Directors of academic units to monitor research outputs and to ensure that the institution complies with its obligations to funders to manage associated research data and to disseminate the results of publicly funded research.\\n\\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Versionnumber:3.0</td><td>Approved by:Research Committee</td></tr><tr><td>Effectivefrom:01/12/2021</td><td>Dateforreview:01/11/2024</td></tr></table></body></html>\\n\\nThe University will provide access to services and facilities that meet sector and funder requirements for storage, access and curation of data produced in the course of research conducted in the University’s name.\\n\\nThe University will provide training, support and guidance on policies and best practice in research data management and preservation.\\n\\nThe Pro Vice Chancellor, Research Enterprise and Scholarship, the Research Committee, and Deans and Directors are responsible for the overall effective management of research data at the OU.\\n\\n## 4. Ethical requirements\\n\\nThe legitimate interests of human participants in research must be protected, according to the principles set out within the University ethics policy (requires login) and within the University’s Ethics Principles for Research Involving Human Participants.\\n\\n## 5. Legal requirements\\n\\nThe legal obligations of individual researchers in relation to research data management are covered within the Public interest disclosure document (requires login), Data Protection Code of Practice (requires login)  and Intellectual Property Policy (requires login).\\n\\n## 6. Availability of research data\\n\\nResearchers should ensure that their handling of OU information complies with the University’s Data Protection Code of Practice (requires login) and Information Security Policies (requires login).\\n\\nData supporting published research must be made available no later than the first date of online publication. Published research papers must include clear and distinct statements on how, and on what terms, supporting data may be accessed. If there is no further supporting research data or data cannot be made available, the published paper should make that clear.\\n\\nSupporting research data must be stored for as long as they continue to be valuable to the researcher and the wider research community, and at least as long as specified by external funders or institutional requirements. This period may be up to ten years, but may vary based on funder requirements.\\n\\nThe University accepts that access to research data may be subject to restrictions for a number of different reasons; in order to protect commercial interests or intellectual property rights, ethical approval requirements, legal or security issues, or other legitimate reason. Where restrictions occur researchers must explain the reasons for this within metadata descriptions, and the length of time the access restrictions will continue.\\n\\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Versionnumber:3.0</td><td>Approved by:ResearchCommittee</td></tr><tr><td>Effective from:01/12/2021</td><td>Date for review: 01/11/2024</td></tr></table></body></html>\\n\\nWhere researchers store research data within ORDO, they should comply with Open University curation policies, including specifying retention periods, nominating responsible individuals within their academic units to review the data, and defining the method of destruction of the data.\\n\\n## 7. Collaborative working\\n\\nIt is the responsibility of the individual researcher to ensure the security of collaboratively produced research data under the University’s name, both during the active research phase and upon completion of the research.\\n\\n# Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion Statement\\n\\nPolicies are inclusive of all Open University staff and Open University postgraduate research students, regardless of age, care experience, caring status or dependency, civil status, disability, family status, gender, gender expression, gender identity, gender reassignment, marital status, marriage and civil partnership, membership of the Traveller community, political opinion, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex, sexual orientation, socio-economic background or trades union membership status.\\n\\n## Further clarification\\n\\nIf you have any queries around the content provided within this document and how to interpret it, please contact the Library Research Support team library-researchsupport@open.ac.uk\\n\\nIf you have any comments about this policy document and how it might be improved, please submit these to APG-Policy-Team@open.ac.uk.\\n\\n## Alternative format\\n\\nIf you require this document in an alternative format, please contact the Library Research Support team library-research-support@open.ac.uk\\n\\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Versionnumber:3.0</td><td>Approvedby:ResearchCommittee</td></tr><tr><td>Effectivefrom:01/12/2021</td><td>Dateforreview:01/11/2024</td></tr></table></body></html>',\n",
       " '# Research Data Management Policy\\n\\n## Purpose of Policy\\n\\nThe purpose of the policy, updated from 2011, is to make clear the responsibilities of the University and its researchers for managing research data well, in order to adhere to accepted good practice, advance the University’s Open Research strategy, and to provide linkages to other relevant university policies, such as the Data Protection Policy. Research data are both University assets and the underpinning of publications representing the scholarly record, which is public. As research culture changes, this policy will be regularly reviewed.\\n\\n## Overview\\n\\nThe current policy has been recognised nationally and internationally as an excellent example, being one of the first of its kind to be written and passed and has been a basis for many other UK universities to build upon. However, the passage of ten years means that important concepts such as FAIR1 and GDPR are missing; also review period and further context has been added.\\n\\nThe University’s Research Data Service offers tools and support for managing data before, during and after data are generated by research projects (  The service is part of the broader Digital Research Services which acts as a single point of access to all of the data and computing services available to researchers at the University of Edinburgh, including the Edinburgh International Data Facility.\\n\\nScope: Mandatory Policy\\n\\nThe policy applies to University researchers, defined as all academic staff and postgraduate research students (PGRs) and informs development of University data-related infrastructure and service.\\n\\nContact Officer Robin Rice\\n\\nResearch Data Service Owner\\n\\nR.Rice@ed.ac.uk\\n\\n## Document control\\n\\nApproved: Dates 09.11.21\\n\\nStarts: 01.01.2022\\n\\nEquality impact assessment: 29.10.2021\\n\\nAmendments: DD.MM.YY\\n\\nNext Review: 2025/2026\\n\\nApproving authority\\n\\nUniversity Executive\\n\\nConsultation undertaken\\n\\nResearch Data Service Steering Group; Digital Research Services Steering Group; College Research Committees; Research Strategy Group\\n\\nSection responsible for policy maintenance & review\\n\\nLibrary Research Support, Library and University Collections\\n\\nRelated policies, procedures, guidelines & regulations\\n\\nRelated University policies are included in the policy itself.

The definition of research data for the purpose of this policy is digital or analog information that is collected, observed, created or reused to produce, validate and enrich research findings and conclusions.2 The University of Edinburgh is committed to maintaining the highest standards of rigour and integrity in all aspects of its research.3 Research data management is a key component of research integrity. Research data management (RDM) refers to the organisation, storage and preservation of data created during a research project. It covers initial planning, day-to-day processes and long-term archiving and sharing, or deletion.\\n\\n### Responsibilities for a research project’s data management\\n\\nResponsibility for managing data during any research project or programme lies with Principal Investigators (PIs) or individual researchers (academic staff or postgraduate research students) working on their own. When responsibility is delegated to data managers, the PI retains accountability, and is responsible as data owner (and data controller when personal data are collected) on behalf of the University. The PI should choose methods, platforms and services for managing data that are affordable through the research grant and comply with University policy and procedures, as well as their funder’s requirements and those of any external data controller. Researchers should be familiar with University RDM solutions as well as disciplinary tools and infrastructure available to them, including their full costs, terms and conditions, in order to make optimal choices for active and archived research data. This approach is commensurate with the University’s commitment to academic freedom. The researcher must comply with the University’s Information Security Policy and Data Protection Policy, as well as Finance regulations, policies and procedures.4\\n\\nWhen a University researcher is collaborating with any external partner, they should agree between them the rights and responsibilities of each party with respect to data collected, including key decisions about data storage, backup and security, registration, access, transfer, retention, destruction or archiving and licensing. (See Rights section below for when data sharing agreements may be required).\\n\\nResearch students who are responsible for their own research and the integrity of data they collect and use will be bound by the University’s policy and procedures.5\\n\\nThe University is responsible for raising awareness of good practice and PIs’ and research students’ obligations with respect to research data, and provision of useful platforms, guidance, and services in support of current and future access, during and after completion of research projects, subject to necessary cost recovery from research funders through PIs’ grant proposals.\\n\\n# Research Data Management Policy\\n\\n## Research Data Management Plans\\n\\nResearchers must create a data management plan (DMP) at the time of their research proposal if any research data are to be collected or used. Plans should cover data types and volume, capture, storage, integrity, confidentiality, retention and destruction, sharing and deposit. A suggested minimum period of retention is three years from the end of the project, however requirements by funders and data providers, as well as disciplinary guidance should be observed.\\n\\nResearch data management plans must specify how and when research data will be made available for access and reuse. Generally, accompanying research data should be made available as soon as findings are published, under appropriate safeguards when necessary. A Data Protection Impact Assessment is required whenever data pertaining to individuals is used.6 Research outputs which convey findings from research data should include a citation or data access statement which clearly provides a route for readers to obtain the data. When the researcher does not hold the intellectual property rights or have permission to make derived data available they must provide a citation or data access statement in relevant publications to the source of data.\\n\\nCosts such as extra storage, long-term retention, or data management effort must be addressed and included in the total cost to funders whose policies accept RDM costs. All UK Research and Innovation funders explicitly state that all costs associated with research data management are eligible under UKRI funding.7 The Edinburgh Research Office, school research support officers and the Information Services’ Research Data Service can provide indicative costs for University RDM services.\\n\\n## FAIR data sharing\\n\\nThe University supports the broad global consensus that publicly funded research data should be made openly available as soon as possible with as few restrictions as necessary.8 Additionally, many UK and international funders have embraced FAIR principles for data sharing (making data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable).9 FAIR acknowledges legitimate reasons for restricting access to data, such as confidentiality concerns, suggesting the need for information governance processes over usage when necessary.10 Principal Investigators and research students should consider how they can best make their data FAIR in their Data Management Plans.\\n\\nDiscoverability and access by machines is considered as important as access by humans, in order to accelerate global science and progress Open Research. FAIR calls for the use of persistent identifiers, standard metadata, vocabularies and licences to allow researchers and computer programs to directly access and process data. An emphasis on reusability means that any relevant documentation, protocols, or designs which add context and usefulness to the data should be included with research data in repositories. Links to relevant publications, people, projects, and other research products such as software or source code should be provided in metadata records, with persistent identifiers when available.\\n\\nIn some cases research products such as models and software code can be deposited with research data in data repositories. However, it may be more appropriate to utilise software\\n\\n# Research Data Management Policy\\n\\nrepositories such as GitLab or GitHub, which offer the ability for partners or others to develop code into new directions while keeping track of versions. Research projects should plan for their software management as well as their data, and consider whether it will be made openly available (perhaps as open source software), and if so what licence is appropriate. In all cases code should be documented in a way that makes its functions transparent to improve quality and enable reuse of software and data. For long-lived projects software sustainability is another consideration which requires updating and refactoring over time.\\n\\nThe University endorses the FAIR data sharing principles for maximising data reuse, and supports related initiatives such as DORA (Declaration on Research Assessment),11 ORCID (Open Researcher and Contributor ID),12 digital object identifiers (DOIs),13 and use of standard open licences for sharing research data and code.\\n\\n## Data repositories\\n\\nResearchers are not expected to meet the FAIR principles on their own. Research data may be used for interdisciplinary research, may be of future historical interest, and all research data represent records of the University, including data that substantiate research findings. Therefore, appropriately documented research data must be offered for deposit and retention in an appropriate national or international data service or domain repository, or a University repository by PIs or their delegates.14\\n\\nThe University supports a free-at-point-of-use trustworthy digital repository for University research data which may be used by PIs and research students.15 A time-limited embargo may be used to ensure data are not made available before related publications, subject to funder mandates. Any data which are retained elsewhere, for example in an international data service or domain repository must be registered with the University.16 These external services may assess data for acceptance according to their criteria. Any lock-in to proprietary databases or unnecessary restrictions must be avoided. Research data which are being actively used for analysis not yet made available may be subject to Freedom of Information or other requests.17\\n\\n## Rights in research data\\n\\nIn determining access rights for research data the legitimate interests of the subjects of research data must be protected. The rights of citizen scientists and the public to access publicly funded research should be considered as well.18 When open access to datasets is not legal or ethical, information governance restrictions on access and use must be applied as necessary.\\n\\nWritten agreements are required when personal data (any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person) is passed from a data controller to a data processor or another data controller, or to a country not bound by the General Data Protection Regulation or equivalent privacy legislation. Written agreements are also useful when the data being shared although not personal data, are confidential or valuable to the parties involved.  The University’s Research Office can assist with providing templates for both incoming and outgoing research data and the drafting and negotiation of the agreements concerned.19\\n\\nExclusive rights to reuse or publish research data must not be passed to commercial publishers or agents without retaining the rights to make the data openly available for reuse, unless this is a condition of funding.\\n\\n## Review\\n\\nThis policy shall be reviewed every five years or when significant changes are required, whichever is sooner. The review will be initiated by Library Research Support in consultation with relevant governance bodies. College Research Committees must be consulted; the Research Strategy Group or equivalent body will grant approval.\\n\\nLast amendment: 10-11-2021\\n\\nReferences\\n1 See  \\n2 This is the operational definition of research data for the purpose of this policy.

       " '# Open Access Research and Research Data Management Policy\\n\\n## Context\\n\\nThe “Open Research” landscape – comprising Open Access publishing and Open Data – has altered substantially since the University’s Open Access Research and Research Data Management Policy was put in place in 2013 and continues to evolve. The University recognises that the transition to Open Access continues to require significant cultural change.\\n\\nThe University of Exeter recognises that Open Access to both research papers and research data allows greater visibility of research and can stimulate new research opportunities and collaborations. Making research papers and data Open Access has been shown to increase citations. Re-use of data can lead to new research opportunities, building on existing research to further discovery.\\n\\n### The University of Exeter’s preferred means for sharing research freely and openly is through self- archiving (the so-called “green” route to Open Access) via the institutional repository (Open Research Exeter – ORE).\\n\\nThe University also supports “easy access” IP and other emerging areas that are part of the “open” landscape.\\n\\nThe University of Exeter is committed to complying with funders’ policies and recognises that the academic community requires support in interpreting and observing sometimes conflicting policies.\\n\\nThe University’s Open Access Research and Research Data Management Policy supports the HEFCE and RCUK position that publicly funded research is a public good that should be made openly available to the public when legally, commercially and ethically appropriate. This policy is designed to help support researchers comply with funding bodies’ requirements on Open Access to research papers and on research data management. This is paramount as the University risks loss of income if it fails to satisfy funders’ expectations in this area.\\n\\nThe University recognises that good practice in research data management is a key part of research excellence. Research data are the evidence that underpins the answer to the research question, and can be used to validate findings regardless of its form (e.g. print, digital, or physical)1. These might be quantitative information or qualitative statements collected by researchers in the course of their work by experimentation, observation, modelling, interview or other methods, or information derived from existing evidence. They may include, for example, experimental measurements, predictions from models, statistics, collections\\n\\nof digital images, sound recordings, transcripts of interviews, survey data and fieldwork observations with appropriate annotations, an interpretation, an artwork, archives, found objects, published texts or a manuscript.\\n\\nResearch data are a valuable asset. It is the collaborative responsibility of researchers and the institution that they are appropriately managed and stored both during and after the research process: to meet legislative, funder, information governance and University requirements; to facilitate data security (confidentiality, integrity, availability); to facilitate appropriate access, collaboration and sharing of data and results.  Good research data management brings benefits to the researcher, the University and the wider community. Examples of such benefits include ensuring that research data is stored safely thus avoiding data loss, the possibility of validating research findings and the ability to reuse and share data sets.\\n\\nThe following policy sets out the University’s expectations on Open Access and research data management.\\n\\n# Policy\\n\\n1. The University of Exeter supports the principles of Open Access to research papers and, where legally, commercially and ethically appropriate, to the research data of its research community.\\n2. The scope of these principles apply to all research conducted at the University, regardless of funding source. They do not imply additional compliance where good practice and relevant research funders’ requirements are already being followed.\\n3. Researchers should always comply with funder policy, and any relevant contractual requirements, on Open Access publishing and research data management.\\n4. The University is responsible for ensuring that appropriate systems are in place to enable management of open access processes, taking advantage of national developments in this area as they emerge.\\n5. The University is responsible for the provision of training, support and advice on Open Access and research data management as well as the provision of a backed-up storage service for completed digital research data and for Open Access research papers.\\n\\n## Open Access publishing\\n\\n6. Lead/corresponding authors are responsible for complying with funder and University policy on Open Access research publications.\\n\\n7. In line with HEFCE’s REF Open Access policy, all researchers should deposit the research papers they produce (journal articles and conference proceedings with an ISSN) whilst employed at the University in the institutional repository, Open Research Exeter (ORE), within three months of acceptance for publication. Embargo periods should not exceed 6 months for Biomedicine, 12 months for STEM disciplines and 24 months for HASS disciplines, in accordance with research funder requirements.\\n8. Where the lead/corresponding author is at another UK institution, overseas institution or is a PhD student or postdoctoral research assistant, Exeter authors are expected to make reasonable efforts to ensure that manuscripts are deposited in a timely manner.\\n9. Authors of other output types (for example, monographs) are encouraged to pursue an open access or open source publication route where possible and practical.\\n\\n## Research data management\\n\\n10. Responsibility for research data management during any research project lies jointly with Principal Investigators (PIs) and researcher(s).\\n\\n11. Published research papers should include a short statement describing how and on what terms any supporting research data may be accessed.\\n\\n12. There is a presumption of open access to data held in a University or other public repository. However, access may be restricted, subject to a time embargo or not permitted for legal (i.e. intellectual property, data protection, confidentiality, contractual requirements), ethical or commercial reasons.\\n\\n13. At all stages of the research process, researchers are responsible for adherence to ethical principles, conditions of ethical or regulatory approvals, research governance requirements or legal agreements, such as terms of use set by providers of datasets.\\n\\n14. Researchers are expected to abide by the principles of information governance and to undertake training where required. Researchers are responsible for compliance with the requirements of the Data Protection Act 1998 and for the creation of metadata and other documentation that enables data to be discoverable, understandable and re-useable.\\n15. RCUK accept that research data management is a valid cost for research proposals. Principal Investigators should ensure that research data management requirements are costed into research proposals for all RCUK proposals and for other funders where allowable.\\n16. To allow for institutional planning on infrastructure and research support, and the validation of existence of appropriate plans to support monitoring of compliance with funder requirements, all research proposals must include research data management plans that address the capture, management, integrity, confidentiality, security, selection, preservation and disposal, commercialisation, costs, sharing and publication of research data and the production of descriptive metadata to aid discovery and re-use when relevant. These should be stored in a sensible and accessible location, ideally alongside other project documentation.\\n17. Data should be actively managed by researchers throughout the project, by following and updating the data management plan with ongoing decisions regarding retention and destruction.\\n18. When research is complete, researchers are responsible for ensuring that research data (including websites) of long term value, or data required by funders or the University, are considered for retention, preservation and curation by offering such data for assessment, deposit and preservation in an appropriate University, national or international data service or domain repository, unless specified otherwise in the data management plan.\\n19. The University is responsible for ensuring safe storage of this data and is responsible for curation of this data in particular instances (i.e. health/social care research and clinical trials) where the University is sponsoring a study and agrees to take responsibility for archiving data.\\n20. All research data selected for retention should be registered with the University’s data repository, even if the data is retained in a national or international data service or domain repository or if the data is not suitable for publishing on Open Access.\\n21. Data selected for retention should not be deposited with any organisation that does not commit to its access and availability for re-use, unless this is a condition of funding or would prevent commercial interests.\\n22. After the deposit of data with a repository, the repository is responsible for the on-going management of that data in accordance with legal, technical and other requirements. However, researchers should ensure that they are satisfied with the sustainability of the repository.\\n23. The University is responsible for the provision of sustainable, secure solutions that meet the requirements for long term data storage, discovery and re-use as set out in these principles.\\n\\n## Funding arrangements\\n\\nAuthors are encouraged to consider the discount publishing and subscription off-set arrangements in place via the Library which enable gold Open Access publishing at no cost to the researcher.\\n\\nThe University will fund the gold Open Access publishing route where required for all RCUK funded research and research funded by the Wellcome Trust (and other charities that contribute to the Charities Open Access Fund), subject to availability of funds.\\n\\nResearchers funded through European Union Framework Programme 7 and Horizon 2020 are encouraged to recoup the costs (or part of the costs) for publishing in fully Open Access journals, subject to terms and conditions and availability of funds.\\n\\nPrincipal Investigators must ensure that the costs for publication of research are included in research applications to other funding bodies. Researchers are also encouraged to check with their funders for provision of funding after the end of their grant.\\n\\nLimited institutional funding for publications arising from research funded by other bodies is available.\\nAuthors wishing to apply for APC funding must contact the Library before submitting their articles.\\n\\nJanuary 2017: Policy revised and approved by Research and Impact Strategy Management Group (RISMG)',\n",
       " '# 1. Introduction and purpose\\n\\nThe University of Manchester recognizes the fundamental importance of research data and the management of related administrative records in maintaining quality research and research integrity and is committed to pursuing the highest standards. The University acknowledges that correct and easily retrievable research data are the foundation of and integral to every research study. They are necessary for the verification and defence of research processes and results. Research data have a long-term value for research and academia, with the potential for widespread use in society.\\n\\nThe University endorses the Research Council Common Principles on Data Policy and requires all its researchers to adhere to them, as well as taking into account any other research data management requirements that may apply.\\n\\nThe purpose of this Policy is to provide guidance and support on the responsibilities of the University and its researchers in managing and preserving current or future research data.\\n\\n# 2. Scope and definitions\\n\\nThis Policy applies to:\\n\\nall research, regardless of whether or not the research is externally funded, and is subject to the provisions of any relevant contracts including funding/collaboration agreements; and all researchers active at The University of Manchester.\\n\\nResearch is any creative and systematically performed work with the goal of furthering knowledge, including discoveries regarding people, culture and society, in addition to the use of such knowledge for new applications.\\n\\nResearchers refers to all research-active members of an institution including employees and doctoral candidates. Persons not directly affiliated with an institution, but who, for purposes of research, make use of or are physically present at the institution, are also included in the term. Visiting researchers or collaborators will also be expected to comply with the Policy.\\n\\nResearch data is the evidence that underpins the answer to the research question and can be used to validate findings. This might be quantitative information or qualitative statements collected by researchers in the course of their work by experimentation, observation, modelling, interview or other methods, or information derived from existing evidence. Research data may take the form of numbers, symbols, text, images or sounds, including computer code, annotated fieldwork observations, or a descriptive record of a physical sample.\\n\\nInformation store is where information is held/stored, for example, paper records in a filing cabinet, data held in IT systems, records stored onsite and offsite (e.g. in the Cloud), approved encrypted removable media. This list is not intended to be exhaustive.\\n\\nInformation Store Owners are accountable for information held within the information store including the approval of any processing activities. For example, the Head of Research Governance, Ethics and Integrity is accountable for information processed in the Data Safe Haven. Where the\\n\\ninformation in an information store is created through many processing activities and accessed by many users (such as the University’s research studies) the Information Store Owner may delegate responsibility for the processing activities to a Processing Activity Owner.  Information Store Owners also include, for example, the creators of databases, spreadsheets, computer code or physical sample collections (this list is not intended to be exhaustive) where they may also be the Processing Activity Owner. The Information Governance Accountability and Assurance Framework Standard Operating Procedure describes the wider accountabilities of Information Store Owners.\\n\\n# 3. Intellectual Property Rights\\n\\nIntellectual property rights (IPR) are subject to the University’s Intellectual Property Policy. IPR might also be defined through further agreements e.g. grants, consortium agreements, or commercial agreements. Where no external agreement exists the University generally has ownership of research data generated in the course of research undertaken by researchers in its employment.\\n\\n# 4. Handling research data\\n\\nResearch data is to be stored and made available for use in a suitable repository or archiving system, and whenever possible, provided with persistent identifiers.\\n\\nIt is important to preserve the integrity of research data. Research data must be stored in an accurate, complete, unadulterated and reliable manner. Furthermore, they must be identifiable, accessible, traceable, re-usable, and whenever possible, interoperable and made available in a timely way with as few restrictions as possible.\\n\\nResearch data is to be stored, made available and assigned a licence for open use in compliance with legal, ethical, and contractual requirements, and providing no funder, third-party or contractual rights prohibit it. Research data of future historical interest and the administrative records accompanying research projects should also be archived.\\n\\nResearch data is a legitimate product of research and must be cited as such adhering to scholarly norms; re-used data must be explicitly traceable and original sources acknowledged.\\n\\nThe minimum archive duration for research data and records are subject to the University’s Records Management Policy and Records Retention Schedule.\\n\\nIn the event that research data and records are to be deleted or destroyed, either after expiration of the required archive duration or for legal or ethical reasons, such action will be carried out only after considering all legal and ethical perspectives. The interests and contractual stipulations of thirdparty funders and other stakeholders, employees and partner participants in particular, as well as the aspects of confidentiality and security, must be taken into consideration when decisions about retention and destruction are made. Any action taken must be documented and be accessible for possible future audit.\\n\\n5. Roles and responsibilities\\n\\n## 5.1 Researchers\\n\\nResearchers are responsible for:\\n\\n1. Management of research data in adherence with principles and requirements expressed in this Policy, and ensuring the appropriate security and integrity of the data, compliance with confidentiality undertakings and data protection law, and respect for ownership of IPR;\\n2. Collection, storage, documentation, access to, and archiving or proper destruction of research data and research-related records. This also includes the definition of protocols and responsibilities within a collaborative research study. Such information must be included in a Data Management Plan (DMP), or in protocols that explicitly define the collection, administration, integrity, confidentiality, storage, use and publication of data. Researchers will produce a DMP for every research study;\\n3. Compliance with the general requirements of the funders and the research institution; special requirements in specific studies must be described in the DMP;\\n4. Planning to enable, wherever possible, the future re-use of data . This includes defining usage rights after a study has completed, with the assignation of appropriate licences, as well as specifying any data storage and archiving requirements;\\n5. Compliance with all organisational, regulatory, institutional and other contractual and legal requirements, both with regard to research data, as well as the administration of research records (for example contextual or provenance information); and\\n6. Registering new research studies at the proposal stage with The University of Manchester to ensure appropriate institutional support.\\n5.2 The University\\n\\n#\\n\\nThe University of Manchester is responsible for:\\n\\n1. Empowerment of organisational units, providing appropriate means and resources for research support operations, the upkeep of services, organisational units, infrastructures, and researcher education;\\n2. Support of established scientific practices from the beginning. This is possible through training, education, support, and monitoring, while in compliance with legislation, regulations, third-party contracts for research grants, University laws, codes of conduct, and other relevant guidelines;\\n3. Developing and providing processes and services for the storage, safekeeping, deposition and registration of research data in support of current and future access to research data during and after the completion of research studies; and\\n4. Providing access to infrastructures for data management planning, and the storage, safekeeping and archiving of research data and records, enabling researchers to exercise their responsibilities (as outlined above) and to comply with obligations to third-party funders or other legal entities.\\n\\n# 6. Compliance\\n\\nThis Policy should be read in conjunction with the University’s Code of Good Research Conduct which sets out the University’s overarching policy framework for good research practice, including the management of research data. All allegations of research misconduct are received centrally and considered under the University’s Code of Practice for Investigating Concerns about the Conduct of Research.\\n\\n# 7. Monitoring and Auditing\\n\\nThis Policy and its implementation will be subject to monitoring and auditing.\\n\\n# 8. Review of Policy\\n\\nThis Policy will be reviewed at least annually or when significant changes are required.\\n\\n<html><body><table><tr><td colspan=\"3\">Version amendment history</td></tr><tr><td>Version</td><td>Date</td><td>Reason for change</td></tr><tr><td>1.2</td><td>March2021</td><td>Updated followingscheduled review</td></tr></table></body></html>\\n\\n# Contact list for queries related to this policy\\n\\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Role</td><td>Name</td><td>Telephone</td><td>Email</td></tr><tr><td>Research Data Management Service team, University of Manchester Library</td><td>Chris Gibson/ Clare Liggins / Eleanor Warren</td><td>01612757853</td><td>researchdata@manchester.ac.uk</td></tr><tr><td>Research Data Management Strategic Lead</td><td>Bill Ayres</td><td>01612757853</td><td>bill.ayres@manchester.ac.uk</td></tr><tr><td>Associate Director, Research and Digital Horizons, University of Manchester Library</td><td>LorraineBeard</td><td>01613064918</td><td>lorraine.beard@manchester.ac.uk</td></tr></table></body></html>\\n\\n# Document Control\\n\\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Policy title:</td><td>Research Data Management Policy</td></tr><tr><td>Date Approved</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Approving Body</td><td>LibraryExecutiveTeam</td></tr><tr><td>Version</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Supersedes</td><td>1.1</td></tr><tr><td>PreviousReviewDates</td><td>March 2018, February 2019</td></tr><tr><td>Next Review Date</td><td>March 2022</td></tr><tr><td>RelatedStatutes, Ordinances&General</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>RelatedPolicies</td><td>TheUniversity ofManchester DataProtectionPolicy The University of Manchester RecordsManagement Policy</td></tr></table></body></html>\\n\\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"3\">RelatedProcedures</td><td>TheUniversityofManchesterIntellectual PropertyPolicy</td></tr><tr><td>TheUniversityofManchesterCopyrightPolicy</td></tr><tr><td>The University of Manchester Research Data Management Standard OperatingProcedure</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"5\"></td><td>TheUniversityofManchesterRecordsRetentionSchedule</td></tr><tr><td>TheUniversity of ManchesterITpolicies and guidelines</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>InformationGovernanceAccountabilityandAssuranceFramework</td></tr><tr><td>StandardOperatingProcedure TheUniversityofManchester Codeof GoodResearchConduct</td></tr><tr><td>Related guidance andorcodesofpractice</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>RelatedInformation</td><td>Open Research Statement</td></tr><tr><td>Policy Owner</td><td>Vice President for Research (Professor Colette Fagan); Associate Vice President for Research (Professor Chris Taylor)</td></tr></table></body></html>',\n",
       " \"# Research Data Management Policy\\n\\n## 1.0 INTRODUCTION\\n\\nIn 2022 Senate approved the policy and procedure for the management of research data. This policy supersedes and updates the first research data management policy of June 2011.  This policy will be reviewed by the Research, Impact and Innovation Committee on a yearly basis or amended in response to changes in the scholarly landscape, future legislation and/or case law.\\n\\n## 2.0 OWNERSHIP\\n\\nResearch Support owns and manages this policy on behalf of The University of Northampton.\\n\\n## 3.0 ORGANISATIONAL SCOPE\\n\\nThis Research Data Management policy is a corporate policy and applies to all employees (and workers, as applicable) of The University of Northampton including any wholly owned subsidiaries, unless an alternative policy exists, subject to any qualifying conditions.\\n\\n## 4.0 POLICY STATEMENT\\n\\n4.1 The University of Northampton recognises that good research is underpinned by good research data management.\\n\\nThe UON Research Ethics Code & Procedures defines ‘failures to adhere to UON policy and/or funder requirements in relation to open access and good data management’ as a form of research misconduct. The Research Misconduct Policy outlines the University of Northampton’s powers and procedures in the event of allegations of research misconduct by staff or students.\\n\\nThis policy specifically covers research data management for all UON Staff and doctoral students at Levels 7 and 8. Principles of good data management should be a required element of research training at Levels 4-6.\\n\\na) Integrity\\n\\nResearch data that is generated and used by University researchers will be managed to a high standard throughout the research data lifecycle as part of the University’s commitment to research excellence. The definition of research data for the purpose of this policy is digital or analogue information that is collected, observed, created or reused to produce, validate and enrich research findings and conclusions.\\n\\nResearch data management (RDM) refers to the organisation, storage and preservation of data created throughout a research project.\\n\\n### b) Responsibility\\n\\nResponsibility for managing data is the Principal Investigators (PIs) or individual researchers (this includes all staff and doctoral students) working on their own.\\n\\nAll staff and students engaged in research should be familiar with the University’s research data management solutions as well as disciplinary/subject specific tools and infrastructure that may be available. The researcher (person undertaking the research and/or managing a research project) must comply with the University’s Information Security Policy, Intellectual Property Policy and Data Protection Policy, as well as Finance regulations, policies and procedures.\\n\\nWhen a researcher from University of Northampton (UON) is collaborating with any external partner, they should agree between them the rights and responsibilities of each party with respect to data collected, including key decisions about data storage, backup and security, registration, access, transfer, retention, destruction or archiving and licensing. (See Rights section below for when data sharing agreements may be required).\\n\\n### Funded Research\\n\\nThe PI/Researcher should choose methods, platforms and services for managing data that are affordable through their research grant (if applicable) and comply with University policy and procedures, as well as their funder’s requirements and those of any external data controller.\\n\\nIn accordance with the recommendations of Research Councils UK, the University of Northampton expects researchers to:\\n\\nkeep clear and accurate records of the research procedures followed and the results\\nobtained, including interim results\\nhold records securely in paper or electronic form\\nmake relevant primary data and research evidence accessible to others for reasonable\\nperiods after the completion of the research - data should normally bepreserved and\\naccessible for at least 10 years from the date of last use\\nmanage data according to the research funder’s data policy, best ethical practice and all\\nrelevant legislation\\n\\nTo meet these expectations, the Principal Investigator/Researcher is, prior to applying for ethical approval, required to produce and then follow a research data management plan PMP). The DMP Online tool has been provided for staff and students at UON to use and is recommended for this purpose.\\n\\n### 4.2 Research data management procedure\\n\\nAt the start of every funded project, the researcher or lead researcher if part of a group will produce a DMP in line with the funder's specific requirements, or if no requirements are specified by the funder, then in accordance with the good practice described by DMP Online.\\n\\nDMPs should cover data types and volume, capture, storage, integrity, confidentiality, retention and destruction, sharing and deposit. A suggested minimum period of retention is ten years from the end of the project, however requirements by funders and data providers, as well as disciplinary guidance should be observed.\\n\\nDMPs must specify how and when research data will be made available for access and reuse.  Underpinning research data should be made available as soon as findings are published, under appropriate safeguards when necessary.  Academics may choose to have six months (STEM)/12 month (HAS) embargo period applied to the data.  A risk assessment is required whenever data pertaining to individuals is used. This must be approved by the relevant Research Ethical Committee prior to research commencing. Research outputs that convey findings from research data must include a data access statement that clearly provides directions for readers to obtain the data or a statement as to why the data is not available (e.g., commercial sensitivity).\\n\\nCosts such as extra storage, long-term retention, or data management effort must be addressed and included in costings to funders whose policies accept RDM costs. Note - All UK Research and Innovation funders explicitly state that all costs associated with research data management are eligible under UKRI funding.\\n\\nThe Principal Investigator/Researcher will be responsible for ensuring that the actions outlined in the DMP are carried out.\\n\\nAt the end of a project data will be deposited in the university's secure central storage solution.  Complete datasets are to be uploaded to the Universities current research information system (Pure) to enable the research support team to deposit this in the university’s secure storage solution (Arkivum). The data must include appropriate\\n\\ndescriptive metadata and, if necessary, accompanying explanatory documentation.\\n\\nDatasets within the university's central storage solution will be subject to review after ten years following date of deposit. The review will be undertaken by the researcher and the Head of Research Support. In the absence of the original researcher, an appropriate academic colleague will conduct the review with the Head of Research Support.\\n\\nIf required as a result of the review, data may be securely destroyed or kept for a further ten-year period.\\n\\n4.2 Rights to use and access research data\\n\\nIn determining access rights for research data, the legitimate interests of the subjects of research data must be protected. The rights of the public to access publicly funded research should also be considered. When open access to datasets is not legal or ethical, information governance restrictions on access and use must be applied as necessary.\\n\\nWritten agreements are required when personal data (any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person) is passed from a data controller to a data processor or another data controller, or to a country not bound by the General Data Protection Regulation or equivalent privacy legislation. Written agreements are also useful when the data being shared although not personal data, are confidential or valuable to the parties involved.\\n\\nExclusive rights to reuse or publish research data must not be passed to commercial publishers or agents without retaining the rights to make the data openly available for reuse unless this is a condition of funding.\\n\\n### 4.3 Solutions for Data Management at UON\\n\\nResearchers have access to active research project space on sharepoint (each project should have a minimum of two spaces (contact research lead to arrange). Datasets should be deposited in PURE (or a link in PURE to the dataset in an existing data repository (e.g., Figshare or another Universities repository) on completion of research project, prior to the submission of any research outputs for publication.\\nLong term digital preservation is achieved through Akivum, which is manged by the Research Support Team, who will action after dataset has been deposited in PURE.\\n\\n## 5.0 DEFINITIONS\\n\\n5.1 RDM – Research Data Management\\n5.2 DMP - Data Management Plan\\n5.3 OA – Open Access\\n5.4 Pure – Current Research Information System\\n5.5 Arkivum – Current Digital Preservation System\\n\\n## 6.0 KEY PRINCIPLES\\n\\nThe University supports the broad global consensus that publicly funded research data should be made openly available as soon as possible and with as few restrictions as necessary.  Many UK and international funders have embraced FAIR principles for data sharing (making data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable).  FAIR acknowledges legitimate reasons for restricting access to data, such as confidentiality concerns.  Principal Investigators/Researchers and research students should consider how they can best make their data FAIR in their Data Management Plans.\\n\\nDiscoverability and access by machines are considered as important as access by humans. FAIR encourages the use of persistent identifiers, standard metadata, vocabularies, and licences to allow researchers and computer programs to directly access and process data. An emphasis on reusability means that any relevant documentation, protocols, or designs which add context and usefulness to the data should be included with research datasets in repositories (Pure).  Links to relevant publications, people, projects, and other research products such as software or source code should be provided in metadata records, with persistent identifiers when available.\\n\\nIn some cases, research products such as models and software code can be deposited with research data in data/subject repositories. However, it may be more appropriate to utilise software repositories such as GitLab or GitHub, which offer the ability for partners or others to develop code into new directions while keeping track of versions. Research projects should plan for their software management as well as their data and consider whether it will be made openly available and if so, what licence is appropriate. In all cases code should be documented in a way that makes its functions transparent to improve quality and enable reuse of software and data. For long-lived projects software sustainability is a further consideration which requires updating and refactoring over time.\\n\\nThe University endorses the FAIR data sharing principles for maximising data reuse, and supports related initiatives such as DORA (Declaration on Research Assessment), ORCID (Open Researcher and Contributor ID), digital object identifiers (DOIs), and use of standard open licences for sharing research data and code.\\n\\n## 7.0 ASSOCIATED DOCUMENTS\\n\\nResearch Ethics Code & Procedures Research Misconduct Policy Academic Integrity and Misconduct Policy\\n\\nRecords Management Policy\\nData Sharing Agreement\\nUniversity Strategic Plan\\nOpen Access Policy\\nFAIR Principles\\nDORA (Declaration on Research Assessment) – UON is a signatory\\n\\n## 8.0 VERSION CONTROL\\n\\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Version Control</td><td>Author</td><td>Approval</td><td>Date Written</td><td>Updates</td><td>Current Status</td><td>Approval of Revision</td></tr><tr><td>Version</td><td>Dawn Hibbert; Head of Research Support</td><td>Senate 26/10/22</td><td>6/10/22</td><td>N/A</td><td>Approved</td><td>N/A</td></tr></table></body></html>\\n\\n### 9.0 Record of Amendments\\n\\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Dates</td><td>Version Number</td><td>Details of</td><td>Approval</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Change</td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>\",\n",
       " '# Research Data Management Regulation\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nResearch data are of great value to Tilburg University and should be managed in a responsible manner. Responsible research data management is essential, from the principles of ‘scrupulousness and transparency’ as stated in ‘The Netherlands Code of Conduct for Research Integrity’. Furthermore, it is in line with the conditions of national and European research funders to stimulate open science and reuse of research data.\\n\\n‘The Netherlands Code of Conduct for Research Integrity’ denominates the institutions’ duties of care to promote and maintain compliance with the code. The Tilburg University Strategy emphasizes the importance of research integrity, and encourages researchers to make their data and research materials publicly available if possible.\\n\\nAlthough managing research data may vary considerably across research disciplines, the Executive Board chooses to offer one university-wide Research Data Management Regulation, in which the joint principles for responsible management of research data are stated. The aim of research data management is to guarantee accessibility to research data and protection of research data against theft, misuse, damage, and loss. The researcher should take care to adequately store and archive his/her research data, and make them retrievable and accessible. Responsible data storage leads to transparency (e.g. allowing other researchers to check published results) and offers possibilities for knowledge dissemination, meta-analysis, and reanalysis. Schools will specify the Research Data Management Regulation in an operating procedure for their School, tailored to the specific circumstances of the research discipline in question and internal School processes.\\n\\n## 1. Framework\\n\\nThe research data generated at Tilburg University are stored, managed, and made accessible in accordance with the legal demands (copyright act, privacy act etc.) developed to this purpose, and the relevant codes of conduct:\\n\\na. The Netherlands Code of Conduct for Research Integrity. Effective as of October 1, 2018 (Dutch version: Nederlandse gedragscode wetenschappelijke integriteit)\\nb. The Netherlands Code of Conduct for Scientific Practice. Principles of good academic education and research. Decreed 31 October 2014. VSNU (in Dutch)\\nc. Tilburg University Scientific Integrity Regulation, 2012\\nd. Code of Conduct for the use of personal data in academic research, 2005 (in Dutch: Gedragscode persoonsgegevens in wetenschappelijk onderzoek, VSNU, december 2005) This Code of Conduct is not available in English. The code is currently under reconstruction. Research data generated by a Tilburg University researcher comply with the ‘FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship’. The (meta)data are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable.\\n \\n\\n## 2. Definitions\\n\\nResearch data\\n\\nBy research data is meant: All (digital and non-digital) data collected and generated during academic research, the instruments with which the research data were collected, and other relevant information such as questionnaires, software, scripts, and lab journals.\\n\\n### Metadata\\n\\nBy metadata is meant: Documentation and/or information on research data, required to understand the content of the data and the context in which the data were collected.\\n\\n## 3. Responsibilities\\n\\nThe researcher/project manager is responsible, at the implementation level, for:\\n\\na. secure data storage during and after the research, for both raw and processed research data;\\nb. responsible data management in accordance with the principles of the Research Data Management Regulation and the additional School’s research data management policy;\\nc. creating a data management plan preceding new research in accordance with the provisions of the School’s research data management policy and observing the obligations mentioned in Article 8 of the Research Data Management Regulation in case personal data are processed for the research;\\nd. observing Article 9 of the Research Data Management Regulation when research is conducted with or for third parties;\\ne. familiarizing students and PhD candidates (performing activities within the area of a Tilburg University researcher’s responsibility) with the Research Data Management Regulation and the School’s research data management policy and supervising this.\\n\\nThe Dean of the School in question is responsible for:\\n\\na. elaborating the Research Data Management Regulation in a School policy and/or procedure;\\nb. informing the academic personnel about the Research Data Management Regulation and the School’s research data management policy;\\nc. supervising compliance with the Research Data Management Regulation and the School’s research data management policy;\\nd. reporting to the Executive Board in the annual research report on how the data management has been given form and content. This also includes a report on the degree to which the researchers in the School comply with the Regulation and the measures taken should the compliance be incomplete.\\n\\nThe Executive Board is responsible for:\\n\\na. formulating a general university policy framework as determined in the Research Data Management Regulation;\\nb. offering knowledge, advice, and support regarding data management;\\nc. offering an adequate infrastructure for data storage and management insofar as the Schools need additional adequate facilities for data storage;\\nd. carrying out and supervising audits about the compliancy with the Research Data Management Regulation.\\n\\n## 4. Storage and access\\n\\nResearch data should be stored securely and permanently, with minimal risk of loss, no later than at the end of the research, or sooner if other rules or regulations are applicable. Research data should be stored together with metadata and all other information required for possible data reuse and verifiability. In case of encrypted research data, the researcher should keep the key in question separate from the research data. The research data, metadata and other information should be stored in facilities made available or designated by Tilburg University (e.g., DataverseNL). Alternatively, it is possible to store and archive research data in discipline-specific repositories or data archives of third parties if they meet the following requirements. The repositories or third-party data archives:\\n\\na. provide facilities to enable research data stored in the repository to comply with the Research Data Management Regulation;\\nb. use open standards for access and metadata wherever possible;\\nc. are preferably certified;\\nd. are technically and organizationally sustainable.\\n\\n## 5. Storage period\\n\\nIf no other storage period is required by an applicable legal, contractual, or subsidy rule, all raw and processed research data must be stored for a period of at least ten years after the moment that the research is formally completed.\\n\\n## 6. Ownership\\n\\nResearch data, generated during employment, internship, or secondment to or on behalf of Tilburg University, are the property of Tilburg University, unless otherwise agreed in a separate contract between Tilburg University and the employee or intern. Advice on the ownership of research data is obtained from the Research Data Office.\\n\\n## 7. Public disclosure\\n\\nTilburg University acts upon the basic principle that research data are made publically available for academic research, as far as reasonably possible, if and insofar as this does not conflict with agreements with research funders, confidentiality obligations, the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (GDPR) and/or intellectual property rights of third parties. Advice on this matter is obtained from the Research Data Office. In any case, the metadata must be made publically available.\\n\\n## 8. Personal data\\n\\nIf the research data contain personal data, the management of the personal data is subject to additional rules from the General Data Protection Regulation (EU 2016/679, GDPR). Personal data are processed in accordance with the GDPR. Researchers who process personal data should report the intended processing in the university’s Data Register, and must inform all parties concerned in order to comply with the documentation and transparency obligations laid down in the GDPR.\\n\\n## 9. Third parties\\n\\nResearchers not employed by Tilburg University, such as research fellows, external PhD candidates, or students working under the responsibility of a Tilburg University researcher, who conduct research at Tilburg University and/or in cooperation with Tilburg University and thus generate research data, should declare in writing that they comply with the Research Data Management Regulation, the School’s research data management policy, and, if applicable, the GDPR.\\n\\nIn the event of cooperation with another research organization and/or third party, it is agreed and recorded in writing that if the research data are generated at the other organization, Tilburg University also has the right to store the research data in conformity with the Research Data Management Regulation. If the research data are generated by both or more research institutions, written agreements are made with those other institutions on the management, storage, and access of the research data, as much as possible in line with the Research Data Management Regulation, the School’s research data management policy, and, if applicable, the GDPR.\\n\\nWhen research is conducted on behalf of an external client, it is agreed with the client that Tilburg University, as far as possible, has the right to manage, save, store, and grant access to the research data, in conformity with the Research Data Management Regulation, the School’s research data management policy, and, if applicable, the GDPR.\\n\\nThe Dean’s consent is required in advance when agreements with third parties involve a deviation from the Research Data Management Regulation, the School’s research data management policy, or the GDPR.\\n\\n# 10. Entry into force and period of validity\\n\\nThe Research Data Management Regulation applies to research commencing after the effective date of January 1, 2018. The Research Data Management Regulation is valid until a new version is adopted or the decision is made to revoke the Research Data Management Regulation.\\n\\nThis version: Executive Board resolution of April 14, 2020.\\nFirst version: Executive Board resolution of September 5, 2017.\\n\\n## Guideline for the Research Data Management Regulation\\n\\n### Content\\n\\nReaders\\' Guide. 8\\n\\n1.

The guideline serves, on the one hand, as an aid for Schools in the development of School policy and, on the other hand, as an explanation of Article 8 (Personal Data) and Article 9 (Third Parties) of the Research Data Management Regulation.\\n\\nThe guideline offers:\\n\\n1. an overview of items that may be part of a School data management policy (the checklists in Chapters 1 through 4);\\n2. instructions for dealing with the obligations of the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 which entered into force on May 1, 2018 if research is carried out with personal data (Chapters 5 and 6);\\n3. Explanation of the support services for research data management via the Research Data Office (RDO) (Chapter 7).\\n\\nInformation on the School policies is available on the university’s intranet:  \\n\\n### 1. Data Management Plan\\n\\nA data management plan (DMP) is a digital document in which the researcher describes what data he or she will collect during a research project, how he or she will store and manage the data during the project, and what will happen to the data after the project has ended. The DMP is drawn up at the start of a new research project. Various models (templates) and checklists are available for drawing up a data management plan, often provided by the research institute or funding agency. The completed template forms the data management plan. During the course of the project, regular checks are carried out to ensure that the plan is still up to date or needs to be adjusted.\\n\\nThe Research Data Management Regulation requires that a data management plan is written at the start of each new research project or program. In the School’s data management policy the following matters can be agreed:\\n\\nWho draws up the data management plan for a project?\\nFor which type of research should a data management plan be drawn up? (for example, projects of PhD candidates and research funded by the NWO or other research funds); How is the drafting of data management plans supervised? To whom should a data management plan be submitted? For information or consent?\\nHow is the updating of data management plans monitored?\\nAre data management plans stored centrally? If so, where? and who has access to it? Which matters that appear in a data management plan can be arranged at the level of the School or institute?\\n\\nMore information on data management plans on the university intranet:  \\n\\n### Template Tilburg University\\n\\nTilburg University offers researchers an “Integrated form for Ethics, Data Management, and the Data Processing Register”. The form differs slightly for each school and can be obtained via the data representative of each School.\\n\\nMany topics that are listed in the Chapters 1 through 4 are covered in this form.\\n\\n## 2. Roles and Responsibilities\\n\\nPersons who (may) play an advisory, supporting, operational, or supervisory role in research data management:\\n\\na. Domain chairperson, research director\\nb. Director of the School or Research Institute\\nc. Research leader (principal researcher)\\nd. Researcher, lector\\ne. PhD candidate\\nf. Student\\ng. Data steward\\nh. Ethics Committee\\ni. Policy officer\\nj. Secretary’s office\\n\\nThe School data management policy may describe who has what responsibilities or duties in dealing with research data within the School or Research Institute.\\n\\n### Explanation Data Steward\\n\\nA data steward1 is an official, usually a researcher, who is responsible for the research data management in one or more research projects. He/she is responsible for the development and alignment of the Research Data Management regulation implementation and advises researchers on the collection, storage, archiving and reuse of data at the School. This can pertain to data in research projects of staff and PhD projects. The research director, the head of the research group, the principal researcher (leader of the research project) or a lector can fulfil the role of data steward, and he or she can delegate tasks to one or more others. A data steward can also be a separate function.\\n\\nIf desired, the position of data steward can be further defined in the School’s data management policy, for example, by recording the following matters:\\n\\nWho designates the data steward? Who can fulfill the role of data steward?\\n\\nWhat is the scope of the position: per research project, research group, School/Researc\\nInstitute?\\nWhat are the duties of the data steward?\\nWhat are the powers of the data steward?\\nCan the data steward delegate duties? If so, which and to whom?\\nTo whom does the data steward report? In what form? With what frequency?\\nHow is continuity guaranteed when a data steward leaves?\\n\\n## 3. Rules and Agreements on Storage, Access, and Archiving\\n\\n### Storage\\n\\nThere are countless ways to lose data: a file is accidentally deleted, a laptop is stolen, the context of the data is unclear, software becomes unusable, a file can no longer be opened, etcetera. It is, therefore, important that every researcher pays attention to storing, organizing, and describing his or her data. It is also good to make agreements about this at the level of the School, Department, or Research Institute. The following could be considered:\\n\\nHow do you organize the safe collection of research data?\\nWhere are data stored for ongoing research?\\nHow are data stored?\\nHow is it organized that the raw data file cannot be changed after storage?\\nHow are the data protected against loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized access?\\nHow is it ensured that it is clear, at all times, which processing the data have undergone? How is version management handled?\\nWhat agreements apply to non-digital data and documentation? How is the connection between non-digital and digital data guaranteed? This includes, for example, completed Informed Consent forms, but also samples, models, etc.\\n\\nMore information about storing research data during research on the university intranet:  \\n\\n### Access\\n\\n#### Ongoing research\\n\\nData from ongoing research will of course be accessible to the researcher(s) directly involved, but there are more parties for whom access to the data may be necessary. In the School’s operating procedure/policy, it can be described:\\n\\nWho have access to data from current research? This includes students who participate in the research project; the data steward; an ethics committee; a fellow researcher who must continue the research if the original researcher unexpectedly drops out; How is this access organized? By whom is access granted?\\n\\n#### Completed research\\n\\nTilburg University is committed to ensuring that data from completed research is publicly accessible and available for reuse in new research. Researchers can ensure this by placing their data after completion of a research project in a data archive that offers the possibility of publishing the data\\n\\nand assigning a persistent identifier to the data (a unique code used to refer/link to the dataset) (see also the section on archiving). Tilburg University offers its researchers the institutional data repository DataverseNL. Tilburg University Dataverse has obtained the CoreTrustSeal quality mark.\\n\\nDatasets containing sensitive data―intellectual property rights of third parties, personal data, corporate information, information that can cause damage when made public―cannot be made freely available. However, these data may be useful for new research. For many data archives it is possible to publish a description of this data and to make the data available only on request.\\n\\nIf an external party outside the regular scientific process submits a request for access to research data, the researcher can contact the Research Data Office for legal advice. This is to prevent that datasets are provided in violation of the rights of third parties. Conditions may be attached to the consent.\\n\\nBefore the researcher decides to file his/her dataset publicly, he/she will also consider whether the dataset may have commercial value. If so, the researcher may decide to file the dataset with restricted/monitored access.\\n\\nThe following points can be included in the School’s operating procedure/policy:\\n\\nWhich data are made publicly accessible? Which data are not?\\nWhen will data suitable for this purpose be made publicly accessible? Who monitors this?\\nHow are data made publicly accessible? Does the School or Research Institute prefer a\\nparticular data archive? If so, which one?\\nUnder which license are data made public?\\nWho handles requests for access to non-public data?\\nWhat are the criteria for granting/rejecting requests for access to non-public data?\\n\\nMore information about publishing research data can be found on the university intranet:  \\n\\n### Archiving\\n\\nThe Research Data Management Regulation requires the storage of research data. For raw and processed research data, a storage period of at least ten years applies. Archiving is done in such a way that the data can be consulted with a minimum of time and action by the researcher him-/herself and by any other researchers (external or otherwise) who wish to use the data for new research.\\n\\nIn the School’s operating procedure/policy practical matters can be arranged, such as:\\n\\nWhat data are archived? What are the criteria for archiving?\\nWhere are data archived and by whom?\\nHow are the data archived? What are the requirements for the description of the data\\n(metadata)?\\nWho oversees archiving and storage periods?\\nWho decides whether to extend the storage period?\\nWhat criteria are used to determine whether the storage period is extended?\\nWhat happens to data for which the storage period is not extended?\\n\\nWhat happens to data from researchers leaving the School or Research Institute? Are researchers who are no longer attached to the School or the Research Institute informed about the extension of the storage period or the destruction of data they have collected? If so, how, when, and by whom?\\n\\nMore information about archiving research data on the university intranet:  \\n\\nMore information about the research data archive Tilburg University Dataverse:  \\n\\nThe School’s data management policy may also provide further instructions for PhD candidates to file the data associated with their thesis in a subject-specific, national, or institutional data archive, for example:\\n\\nWho ensures that a PhD candidate files his or her data?\\nWhen should the dataset be filed?\\nDoes the School or Research Institute have a preference for a particular data archive? If so,\\nwhich one?\\nShould the dataset, if possible, also be made publicly accessible? If so, under which license?\\nWho registers where the dataset is filed?\\nShould a copy of the dataset be left with the School or Institute? If so, where is it stored and\\nwho supervises it?\\nWho handles any requests for access to the data?\\n\\n## 4. Support and Training\\n\\nThe School’s operating procedure/policy may describe which support, education, and training will be arranged for whom, and by whom. For example:\\n\\n(additional) training of researchers training and supervision of PhD candidates ▪ training and guidance of students training of data steward(s) practical support\\n\\n## 5. Rules and Agreements with Third Parties\\n\\nIt is also important that research data are handled carefully in accordance with the Research Data Management Regulation when collaborating with or conducting research on behalf of a third party. However, third parties are not necessarily bound by the Research Data Management Regulations. Third parties may be bound by internal regulations of their own institution or organization. It is, therefore, important that the subject of data management is part of the agreements made prior to the research and that these agreements are added to the collaboration agreement or commission agreement.\\n\\nStudents are also considered as third parties in this respect. If a student participates in a research under the responsibility of a Tilburg University researcher, the researcher will have to ensure that the student signs a statement in which he/she declares that he/she is familiar with the Research Data Management Regulations and will act in accordance with them. A standard model for such a statement is available.\\n\\nIn the event that the research data contain personal data, it may be necessary to conclude a socalled processor agreement. In many cases, the use of software and/or tools for the storage and/or collection of research data must also be based on a processor agreement with the owner of the software and/or tools. This also applies if a third party collects and/or stores the data on behalf of the researcher.\\n\\nAlso see: \"Rules and agreements in case research data contain personal data and third parties\" (page 15).\\n\\n## 6. Rules and Agreements with Respect to Personal Data\\n\\nIf personal data is used for research purposes, a researcher encounters the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (GDPR), which imposes additional rules and obligations.\\n\\nThe \"VSNU Code of Conduct for the Use of Personal Data in Scientific Research\" (hereinafter referred to as the \"Code of Conduct for the Use of Personal Data\") is a translation of the GDPR for societal and behavioral science research. This Code of Conduct for the Use of Personal Data gives the researcher a practical assessment framework on how to handle personal data with care. In the Code of Conduct, personal data is defined as any data relating to an identified or identifiable natural person, i.e. any data that, without disproportionate time or effort, can lead to the identification of a natural person. Personal data are either directly identifying (personal) data or not directly identifying (personal) data.\\n\\nIt is not the intention to discuss the Code of Conduct in its entirety here. Only the starting points for the standard cases are mentioned here:\\n\\nGedragscode persoonsgegevens in wetenschappelijk onderzoek, VSNU, december 2005 (Dutch\\nonly)\\n(NB the sections and page numbers mentioned here refer to the text of the Code of Conduct for the\\nUse of Personal Data) Only use lawfully collected data obtained with the consent of the respondent for a research. Exceptions are possible (see Section 3.3 onwards on page 12 of the Code of Conduct for the Use of Personal Data). Collect data sparingly: no more personal data may be collected than is necessary for the research; anonymous data should be used if possible; personal data will only be processed if there is no other option (see Section 3.2 on pages 11–12 and page 25 onwards of the Code of Conduct for the Use of Personal Data). When processing directly identifying data, two files should be created (communication data and research data). Linking takes place via an empty administration number and the access rules for the files must differ (see Section 3.6, page 13 and page 27 of the Code of Conduct for the Use of Personal Data).\\n\\nPersonal data must be protected during processing and storage so that unauthorized persons (those not involved in the research) cannot have access to them (see Chapter 4, page 15, page 29, and page 30 of the Code of Conduct for the Use of Personal Data). Publication may only be made if this cannot be traced back to persons.\\n\\n### Transparency: report to the Data Protection Officer and schedule\\n\\nIf the research consists of processing data that can be directly or indirectly traced back to a natural person, the researcher must fill in the \"Integrated form for Ethics (if applicable), Data Management and the Data Processing Register”. The form helps to map out the processing operations that will take place for the purpose of the research. The completed schedule should then be sent to the appropriate email address of the School (see the overview of Ethics Review Boards of each School).\\n\\nOn the basis of the completed inventory schedule, the Data Protection Officer, if necessary in consultation with Legal Affairs, can advise on compliance with the legal conditions for the protection of personal data and the Code of Conduct. It can also be tested whether further assessment of the security measures by the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) of LIS is desirable.\\n\\nIt is important to comply with the GDPR in order to protect the privacy interests of those involved. Another reason has been added since 2016: the Authority for Personal Data may impose a fine for breaches of the GDPR (with a maximum of € 820,000).\\n\\n### Storage of personal data\\n\\nVerifiability is an aspect of ethical research. On this basis, it is justifiable to store the personal data file for a minimum of ten years if this is necessary for verifiability (as stated in article 5 of the Research Data Management Regulation). However, a distinction must be made between direct and indirect identifying data.\\n\\nMain rules from the Code of Conduct on personal data (see Section 3.10, page 14 and the explanation on page 29)\\n\\n1. Communication file: all communication data (except sex, place of residence, and year of birth, Section 3.8, page 14) should be deleted as soon as it is no longer necessary for the purpose of the research to have them and data are no longer necessary for contacting the person concerned. If the communication data are kept longer than six months after being obtained from data subjects, the processing of personal data must be reported to the Data Protection Officer. This notification can be made immediately upon the first notification by stating in the “Application Form Research Ethics, Data Management, Data Processing Register” that the communication data will be stored for longer than six months.\\n2. Files containing directly or indirectly identifying personal data, in which no distinction is made between communication and research files, may be kept for as long as it is reasonably foreseeable that it will be necessary for the research. Files containing anonymous data may be kept as long as it is certain (by means of new analysis techniques) that these data do not allow individuals to be traced.\\n\\n### Data leaks: report\\n\\nOn January 1, 2016, the Data Breaches (Reporting Obligation) Act came into force. This duty to report means that organizations that process personal data must immediately report to the Authority for Personal Data as soon as there is a data leak.\\n\\nMore information on data leaks and how to report a data breach or security problem:  \\n\\n### Rules and agreements in the event that research data personal data are shared with third parties\\n\\nIf you share research data that includes personal data, for which Tilburg University is responsible, with a third party (e.g., a hospital, a researcher who is not employed by Tilburg University, or the data is stored by a third party), further conditions apply. When you engage a third party to process data for your research (for example in the case of the storage of research data with personal data by a third party), the third party is often seen as a so-called processor. In such situations, it is a legal obligation to conclude a processor agreement between Tilburg University, as the party responsible for the data processing, and the processor. In this agreement, the parties lay down, for example, the purposes for which the data may be processed by the processor and the security measures to be taken by the processor. The processor agreement, like collaboration or research agreements, must be signed by the School Board. Legal Affairs has a model is available.\\n\\nIn other situations in which research data with personal data are shared with third parties, this is only allowed on the condition that further processing of the personal data by this third party is not incompatible with the purpose for which the data were originally collected by you.\\n\\nIf students are involved in the research who will also process personal data, the students will have to sign a confidentiality agreement. Care must also be taken to ensure that the personal data processed by the students are protected against loss or unlawful processing.\\n\\nMore information about scientific research and the GDPR on the university intranet:  \\n\\n## 7. Research Data Office\\n\\nThe Executive Board has appointed LIS for carrying out its responsibilities set out in the Research Data Management Regulation. In order to support the implementation of the Research Data Management Regulations, LIS has set up a Research Data Office (RDO). This Research Data Office functions as a central hub in which various divisions of Tilburg University bundle their support services regarding research data. Coordination of the RDO is the responsibility of LIS, which, depending on the subject, calls in specialist assistance from Legal Affairs, IT Services, Academic Services, and other parties involved.\\n\\n### The RDO:\\n\\nprovides supervision and manages external relations regarding research data management;\\nmanages a supporting website on research data management\\n \\nparticipates in policy development and audits.\\n\\nIf you have any questions about the Research Data Management Regulations, this guideline and research data management (RDM) in general, please contact the authors of this guideline at researchdataoffice@tilburguniversity.edu.

Policy Implementation and Review Procedures .\\n\\n### 1. Policy Background\\n\\nResearchers and students at UCL create data as part of the research workflow.  These data represent the evidence that underpins academic endeavours and form one half of the scholarly record, the other half represented by publication output.\\n\\nData are facts, observations or experiences on which an argument or theory is constructed or tested.  Data may be numerical, descriptive, aural or visual.  Data may be raw, abstracted or analysed, experimental or observational.  Data include but are not limited to: laboratory notebooks; field notebooks; primary research data (including research data in hardcopy or in computer readable form); questionnaires; audiotapes; videotapes; models; photographs; films; test responses.  Research collections may include slides; artefacts; specimens; samples.\\n\\nAdvances in technology have enabled the exponential growth in the creation of data, which in turn has led to both novel abilities in conducting research (data-driven science) and a new, significant data management burden.\\n\\nUCL recognises that appropriate management of research data leads to an enhanced research practice respecting specialist knowledge, supporting synthesis of new knowledge and facilitating collective and collaborative working practices in order to gain wisdom1.  UCL considers the research data generated by its members as a valuable research output, an asset to the institution and a critical contribution to the knowledge economy2\\n\\nThe purpose of this Policy is to provide a framework to define the responsibilities of all UCL members and to guide researchers and students in how to manage the data, enabling research data to be maintained and preserved as a first class research object and made available to widest possible audience for the highest possible impact.\\n\\nThis policy is intended to ensure that research data created as part of the research process are:\\n\\nAccurate, complete, authentic and reliable;\\nAttributable and citable;\\nIdentifiable, retrievable and available with minimal barriers;\\nSecure from loss and degradation;\\nRetained for a minimum of ten years after publication or public release;\\nCompliant with legal obligations, ethical responsibilities and the rules of funding bodies.\\n\\n### 2. Policy Statements\\n\\n1. It is the policy of UCL that its members can fulfil the requirements of good research practice by enabling them to manage research data in a manner that maximises data impact and acknowledges data value as primary research output by its members.\\n2. It is the policy of UCL that responsibility for managing and preserving research data is shared between all members of the College.\\n3. It is the policy of UCL that following primary use (e.g. publication) or when research data is archived for long term preservation, these data will be made available in the most open manner appropriate. Unless covered by third party contractual agreements, legislative obligations3 or provisions regarding ownership, UCL research data will be provided using a Creative Commons CC0 waiver ; supported by data citation guidelines\\n\\nsimilar to existing publishing conventions.  This will ensure that re-used data are unambiguously identifiable and that appropriate credit and attribution is made.\\n\\n4. It is the policy of UCL that clear lines of responsibility are established so that research data generated at UCL will always have an owner, responsible for preserving research data.\\n\\nIn complying with this policy, UCL researchers will comply with all national and many international policies and requirements from funders of academic research5.\\n\\n### 3. Responsibilities\\n\\n#### 3.1. Lines of Responsibility\\n\\nData Creators (students, supervisors and Researchers)\\nUCL Research Data and Network Services Executive\\nDirector of UCL Library Services and UCL Records Manager\\nRIISG\\nVice Provost (Research)\\nProvost\\n\\n#### 3.2. Student Researchers and Supervisors\\n\\nEmbedding research data management practice in early career researchers is critical to establishing an effective data management ethos.  Good research practice requires students and their supervisor to plan the collection, storage, security and use of research data, in accordance with conventions in their fields of study and obligations from their institutions.\\n\\nIt is the responsibility of students and their supervisors that good practice in data management is planned and documented as part of their research process.  The plan and execution should form a critical part of the research process\\n\\nStudent Researchers and Supervisors should:\\n\\nEstablish collection and storage procedures for their research data that are acceptable to their supervisor.\\nEnsure that their plans and activities are documented in accordance with their obligations under good practice and any applicable legislation.\\n\\n#### 3.3. Researchers\\n\\nIt is good research practice, and frequently a requirement for grant applications, to plan data management before commencing any research activity.  Often this is in the form of a data management plan.\\n\\nIt is the responsibility of the individual researcher, or the Principal Investigators if a team of researchers is involved, to generate and execute a data management plan.  A template for Data Management Plans can be found on the Digital Curation Centre website6\\n\\nResearchers should:\\n\\nDevelop and record appropriate procedures and processes for the collection, storage, use, re-use, access, and retention of the research data associated with their research program;\\nEstablish and document agreements for research data management when involved in a joint research project, collaborative research or research undertaken in accordance with a contractual agreement. Ensure that the integrity and security of their data is maintained;\\nBe aware of their obligations and potential liability when handling data protected by the UK Data Protection Act (1998);\\nPlan for the on-going custodial responsibilities for the research data at the conclusion of the research project or on departure from the University;\\nInclude recommendations in Data Management Planning to the Head of Department or research Unit for destruction of research data;\\nInclude within research grant proposals appropriate consideration of the cost and time implications of data storage & management within grant proposals.\\n\\n#### 3.4. Heads of Department\\n\\nHeads of Departments should promote good practice in all aspects of research including research data management.  They should assure that staff and students are aware of their responsibilities and obligations in effective management of research data and identify or promote training where gaps in these skills are identified. Heads of Departments often assume ownership of data when researchers leave UCL or have researcher data ownership transferred to them.\\n\\nIt is the responsibility of Heads of Departments to ensure good practice and legal obligations relating to the management of research data within their department are fully supported.  They should identify and implement any training or skills development required in executing their responsibility\\n\\nHeads of Department should:\\n\\nAuthorise procedures adopted by researchers and student researchers (following consultation with their supervisor) for the collection, storage, use and if required destruction of their research data;\\nEnsure staff conducting human research, and students under their supervision, are aware of and appropriately trained in all of their responsibilities and obligations relating to research data collected in the course of their research;\\nEstablish and implement departmental procedures for the storage and retention of research data in line with University policy or legislative obligation;\\n\\n### Institutional Research Data Facility (UCL Research Data Services)\\n\\nUCL has recognised the strategic importance of service provision in the management and preservation of research data and is committed to supporting a permanent team within the centralised ISD organisation that will create and support an institutional service for all UCL researchers.\\n\\nIt is the responsibility of UCL Research Data Services to provide large scale, high performance networked storage for research projects and long term storage facilities for the preservation and dissemination of UCL research data\\n\\nThe UCL Research Data Service7 will provide a flexible, responsive and cost efficient data management facility that is resilient and long term.  The UCL Research Data Service will provide:\\n\\nCapacity to manage very large scale data storage and movement8 A service layer that will enable effective data management facilities9 An archive facility that will undertake long-term preservation activities10.\\n\\nUCL Library Services can also curate smaller collections of digital research data which are not eligible for inclusion in the UCL Research Data Service.\\n\\nIt is the responsibility of UCL Research Data Services and key stakeholders to provide guidance and guidelines relating to good research data management practice and support UCL researchers in executing their responsibilities under this policy\\n\\n#### 3.6. Vice Provost (Research)\\n\\nUCL’s Vice-Provost (Research) is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the UCL Data Policy and ensuring that UCL complies with funder requirements and academic needs for research data management.\\n\\n#### .7. Research Information IT Services Group (RIISG)\\n\\nUCL’s Research Information and IT Services Group is responsible for maintaining and updating the Research Data policy, and for ensuring that new developments and best practice at a national and international level are reflected in the policy.\\n\\n#### 3.8. Provost\\n\\nThe Provost, as senior Executive Officer in UCL, in conjunction with the Vice-Provost (Research) and UCL’s Senior Management Team, has the role of ensuring that UCL’s policy for, and practice of, research data management is fit for purpose.\\n\\n### 4. Policy Implementation and Review Procedures\\n\\nThis policy will not supersede any other UCL policy.\\n\\nThe Research Information and IT Services Group (RIISG) is responsible for approving the policy and any amendments that may be necessary.\\n\\nThe Vice-Provost (Research) chairs RIISG ex officio and is responsible for ensuring that both divisional and central resources are sufficient for compliance with this policy.\\n\\nThe Director of Library Services and the UCL Records Manager are together responsible for co-ordinating the implementation of the policy. This policy will be implemented by applying archival and records management principles with relevant technical solutions.\\n\\nThis policy will be reviewed at least every 3 years by the RIISG and in consultation with the UCL Research Data and Network Services Executive.\\n\\nThe UCL Research Data Services Team will provide advice on technical solutions for research data management and policy direction. UCL Library Services will provide guidance and advocacy for research data management, data deposition and related metadata description',\n",
       " '## ULSTER UNIVERSITY\\n\\n# Research and Impact\\n\\n### Research Data Management Policy\\n\\n(currently undergoing equality screen)\\n\\n## ULSTER UNIVERSITY\\n\\n### Research Data Management Policy\\n\\nUlster University recognises that research data created, collected, generated or otherwise produced during the research process are a key asset that will continue to have value for the creator, institution, and research community as a whole.  As an institution, Ulster University supports the principle of open access to publicly funded research outputs.  Research data generated at the University is recognised as an institutional asset that when shared openly not only increases the visibility of Ulster University’s research but also facilitates public engagement and creates new opportunities for knowledge exchange and collaboration.\\n\\n#### 1. Preamble\\n\\n1.1 The University operates in an increasingly complex, data-oriented, environment which requires effective collection and management of, and open access  to, research data:\\n\\nto comply with the requirements of funding bodies\\nto underpin research excellence and academic integrity\\nto increase impact\\nto validate research results\\nto enable re-use in the interests of follow-up studies and the creation of new knowledge.\\n\\n1.2 To this end, the University has developed a Research Data Management (RDM) Policy which aims to:\\n\\nensure that those involved in the research process are aware of their data-related responsibilities\\nensure that the University meets its obligations with regard to research data management as defined by research funders\\npromote open access to research data produced at Ulster University in order to facilitate data discovery, citation, sharing and collaboration.\\n\\n1.3 A robust RDM Policy will demonstrate and ensure:\\n\\ngood research practice and procedures\\nprotection of intellectual property rights (IPR)\\nappropriate recording, storage, security and maintenance of access to research data\\ncompliance with relevant legislation and regulations.\\n\\n1.4 This policy:\\n\\nadheres to the UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) Common Principles on Data Policy as well as to the specific requirements of the EPSRC Policy Framework on Research Data\\nprovides a corporate framework with defined roles and responsibilities for the collection, quality, storage, security, maintenance and dissemination of research data\\nshould be read in conjunction with all related policies, regulations and guidance documents (see Annex 1)\\n\\n#### 2 Scope\\n\\n2.1 This policy applies to all members of the University conducting research or involved in the creation, collection or generation of research data.  This shall include, but not be limited to, employed staff, research students, honorary staff, and visiting academics.  This group will be collectively referred to as ‘Researchers’.\\n\\n2.2 The University’s data management policy applies to research data in all its forms irrespective of whether or not the research is funded.  This may include raw data captured from instruments, derived data, documents, spreadsheets & databases, lab notebooks, visualisations, models, software, images, measurements and numbers.\\n\\n2.3  This policy applies to all approved research projects conducted at the University by Researchers regardless of whether they are externally funded or not.\\n\\n2.4  This policy will be augmented in due course with detailed procedures and guidelines for staff in relation to the management of their research data.\\n\\n#### 3 Policy Requirements\\n\\n3.1 Research data must be created, maintained and shared in accordance with contractual, legislative, regulatory, ethical and other relevant requirements at the local, national and international level. Externally-funded researchers must ensure compliance with their funder’s policy on research data management and data publication.  In cases were researchers may be affected by a number of policies, funder policy should take precedence.\\n\\n3.2 All new research proposals [from date of adoption] must include research data management plans or protocols that explicitly address data capture, management, integrity, confidentiality, retention, sharing and publication.\\n\\n3.3 The storage, management and sharing of research data carries a cost, particularly if there is a need for long-term curation and dissemination, requiring the provision of staff and system resources.  Costs for data management and sharing activities should be written into research grant applications, unless explicitly forbidden by the funder.\\n\\n3.4 Responsibility for research data management through a robust research data management plan during any research project or programme lies primarily with Principal Investigators (PIs) although all researchers have a personal responsibility to manage effectively the data they create.\\n\\n3.5 Where a project involves external collaborators, the lead organisation is responsible for putting appropriate formal agreements in place covering the contributions and rights of the various organisations and individuals involved.  All such agreements should be reviewed and approved by the University before the project begins.  In cases where the project is led by an external partner there is still a requirement for data generated or shared by Ulster University to be managed by a named individual with the University, usually the Lead Researcher at Ulster.\\n\\n3.6 Research Data must be held in a managed storage environment throughout the period of retention.  Data must be retained in an appropriate format and storage facility, normally for a period of at least 10 years from the date of any publication which it is based upon.  Where specific regulations with regard to data retention apply, eg: from funders, these regulations should prevail, particularly where the required retention period is longer than the University requires.\\n\\n3.7 The University will provide an infrastructure and support service for the storage, backup, registration, deposit and retention of research data in support of current and future access and, where appropriate, guidelines and templates for the research data management process and plans.  Appropriate safeguards will be put in place to ensure the legitimate interests of subjects of research data are protected.\\n\\n3.8 Any research data which is retained or hosted outside the University (eg: in an external repository which is subject/journal or publisher specific) must be registered with the University.\\n\\n3.9 Research data selected for archiving must be made openly available, where appropriate, with as few restrictions as possible.  Data sharing represents a key component of good research practice that contributes to the University’s strategic objective of increasing the visibility of Ulster’s research.  The University encourages researchers that have created or captured data to make it available for access and use in a timely manner, in conditions where it is feasible under contractual, legislative, regulatory, ethical or other obligations.  Where necessary, appropriate safeguards should be put in place to protect participants and ensure that access conditions are met (e.g. Anonymisation, access passwords, inclusion of rights statement) in compliance with Ulster University’s guidance on good research practice.\\n\\n3.10 Research data produced and/or used during research must in cited in research outputs.  Good research practice is built upon the recognition of all source material that contributes to the performance of research activities.  Researchers must ensure that research data used during the research process is cited in conference papers, journal articles and other research outputs. Journal publications that report on publically funded research should include an access statement that indicates how research data may be accessed and any associated conditions.\\n\\nA persistent identifier, such as a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) should be included when one is available\\n\\n3.11 Research data deemed to be of future historical interest, including data that substantiate research findings, will be offered and assessed for deposit and retention in an appropriate external data service or a University repository.\\n\\n3.12 Exclusive rights to host, reuse or publish research data should not be handed over to commercial publishers or agents without retaining the rights to make the data openly available for re-use, unless this is a condition of funding.\\n\\n#### 4 Responsibilities\\n\\n4.1 The Pro Vice-Chancellor (Research & Impact) is responsible for overseeing and ensuring the implementation of this policy.\\n\\n4.2 The University is responsible, through the Department for Research & Impact, for providing an appropriate infrastructure for the long-term storage of data including, training, guidance and support for those responsible for the creation of research data.\\n\\n4.3 Associate Deans (Research & Impact)/Research Directors are responsible for ensuring tha researchers in their areas are aware of this policy.\\n\\n4.4 The practical and operational responsibility for research data throughout the lifecycle of the project is the responsibility of the Principal Investigators.  Their key responsibility is to ensure the Data Management Plan adheres to the research funders’ obligations and compliance with this policy.\\n\\n4.5 All Researchers must adhere to their obligations under this Policy either as Principa Investigator or by proactively supporting the Principal Investigator.\\n\\n5.

Description\\n\\nThis policy describes responsibilities and provides guidance on how Umeå University is to manage and preserve research data during the entire course of a research project from the planning stage, during the project and after the end of the project.\\n\\n### 2. Background\\n\\nScholarly publication is changing and scientific research articles are being made openly accessible through Open Access. The Swedish Government, funding bodies and large publishers recommend or request that research data is made accessible as far as legislation allows. Research data becomes a natural part of the scholarly publication process.\\n\\nThe objective of the Government’s research bills “Collaborating for knowledge – for society’s challenges and strengthened competitiveness” (2016/17:50) and “Research, freedom, future – knowledge and innovation for Sweden” (2020/21:60), is that a transition to open access to research results, including research data, should be fully implemented by 2026. Umeå University sees the adoption of this policy as a part of a process to transition to open access to research results.\\n\\nThrough this policy, Umeå University accepts the recommendation of the Swedish Research Council stating that research data should be managed in accordance with the international FAIR principles for scientific data management1,2. The FAIR principles mean that research data must be managed in a way that makes it findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable. The FAIR principles do not mean that all research data should be open, but as open as possible, and it should have a detailed description using metadata legible by both humans and machines.\\n\\nDue to the nature and content of this document, the following aspect have not been taken into account: work environment, sustainability, collaboration, accessibility, as well as student and international perspectives.\\n\\nThis policy is in line with the work of the university to implement HRS4R and with the university’s vision to create a work environment that provides equal opportunities for all employees. It is considered to have positive consequences for the equal opportunity work at Umeå University and to improve the university’s research environment.\\n\\nThis document has been translated from Swedish into English. If the English version differs from the original, the Swedish version takes precedence.\\n\\n### 3. Definitions\\n\\n#### Research data\\n\\nIn this policy, research data is defined according to the definition from the Swedish Research Council3: “Research data is digital information collected in order to be analysed for scientific purposes. Examples of such research data include results from experiments and measurements, observations from field work, statistics, questionnaire responses, interviews and images. Physical objects such as scientific and archaeological collections, physical art works or biobanks are not\\n\\n# UMEA UNIVERSITY\\n\\nregarded per se as research data; however, digital information about such objects is to be regarded as research data”.\\n\\n#### Research\\n\\nResearch is “scientific experimental or theoretical work or scientific studies conducted through observation if the work or studies are done to acquire new knowledge; it is also development work on a scientific basis, but not such work or studies that are performed only within higher education on a first or second-cycle levels”.4\\n\\n#### Official document\\n\\nAn official document is a document or recording that is stored by an authority and has been received by or created at an authority. A recording is considered to be stored by an authority, if it is accessible to the authority with technical aids that the authority itself uses for transmission of its content in such a form that it can be read, heard or otherwise comprehended.\\n\\n### 4. Starting points\\n\\nUmeå University shares the view that everyone should have open access to research publications and research data that are completely or partly funded by public funds to the extent that is permitted by legislation, ethics and commercial interests. The research data that forms basis for scientific publications must be easily accessible for peer review, journals and publishers and be made accessible in accordance with the recommendations of the Swedish Research Council. All source data and materials that document the research process are property of Umeå University and must, as a general rule, be archived according to the university’s records management plan for research, when a research project has been completed.\\n\\nUmeå University supports the establishment of sustainable research infrastructures and services for managing research data at a local and national level. Based on current laws such as the General Data Protection Regulation, the Freedom of the Press Act and other regulations, internal regulatory documents and requirements from the Swedish Research Council, the EU and other research funding bodies, Umeå University offers their researchers support in managing and making research results and research data accessible.\\n\\nThe local infrastructure for research data and research data management is to be developed continuously and must follow laws, regulations and guidelines from the Government, the EU, the Swedish Research Council and other relevant research funding bodies and actors. In this way, correct management, storage, sharing and long-term preservation of research data is ensured.\\n\\nThis policy applies to all employees who conduct research and includes all subjects and areas where research is performed at Umeå University. It clarifies responsibilities and provides guidance on how Umeå University should manage and preserve research data from the planning stage of a research project, during the project and after the end of the project. Intellectual property rights are not included in this context.\\n\\n### 5. Responsibility and rules for management of research data\\n\\nThe main rule is that research data must be managed correctly and securely in accordance with current legislation, ethics and good research practice.\\n\\n#### 5.1 Publication of research data\\n\\nUmeå University adopts the Swedish Research Council’s recommendations for publishing research data in the version published by the council in spring 2020.\\n\\nThe Swedish Research Council recommends that research data financed via public funds, and applicable legislation allows to be published, should be published openly on the internet within a reasonable time after the research results have been published.\\n\\n#### Legal and ethical aspects affect access\\n\\nDetermining which data can be published with open access shall always be based on applicable legislation. Some research data must not be published with open access due to legal or ethical aspects (if they are covered by secrecy legislation, include personal data or IP material, for example), but the options for publishing data may also be affected by other factors, such as the volume of the data sets.\\n\\nIf open access to research data cannot be provided, the reason why this is not possible should be documented.\\n\\nData created in the research process and forming the basis for publications This recommendation covers data created during the research process and forming the basis for scientific publications. If already existing data from other actors have been used, such as various types of public agency data, then these data only constitute research data if they have been analysed, processed or otherwise refined during the research process. Already existing data that have only been used in their original form and that are already managed and made accessible by another actor are not covered by this recommendation.\\n\\n#### Metadata should also be published with open access\\n\\nBoth research data and data describing research data (known as metadata) should be published with open access. If there are obstacles to publishing research data, the focus should in the first instance be on making metadata openly accessible on the internet. In this way, users can find information on what research data exists, even when there are obstacles to open publication, for example lack of a suitable publication platform or technical limitations that prevent all data from being published.\\n\\n#### Publication according to the FAIR principles\\n\\nPublication of research data can be done using various digital platforms, for example via the higher education institution where the research is conducted or via other relevant national and/or international portals, infrastructures and similar organisations and platforms. The publication of research data shall always be based on the FAIR principles.\\n\\n#### 5.2 Data management plans\\n\\nUmeå University recommends its researchers to write a data management plan5 at the beginning of each research project and to keep it updated continuously throughout the project. A data\\n\\nmanagement plan should, for instance, specify how research data is to be collected, stored, managed, documented, used and made accessible during and after the research project. Umeå University has a template for data management plans, which, together with help texts, is also available in an online tool. In some cases, it is mandatory for researchers to establish a data management plan, for instance for certain research projects funded by the EU and by the Swedish Research Council. A data management plan should also be set up for all new doctoral student projects, together with the corresponding research plan.\\n\\n#### 5.3 Ownership and collaborations\\n\\nResearch data generated in research at Umeå University is an official document of the authority in accordance with the Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act and the archive legislation, and are owned by Umeå University. In research projects that are conducted in collaboration with external parties such as other Swedish authorities, Region Västerbotten, companies and universities abroad, the terms of ownership of research data must be regulated in collaboration agreements that should be reviewed by a university legal officer. The starting point for such agreements is that Umeå University reserves the rights to use, publish, share or make publicly accessible research data that is produced or stored at Umeå University, and that the recommendations of the Swedish Research Council for publishing research data are followed. The terms must not restrict the obligations of the university under the Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act and the archive legislation.\\n\\n#### 5.4 Storage and giving access to research data\\n\\nResearch data must be managed and stored at Umeå University in accordance with the routines that Umeå University recommends for storage and information security. Umeå University is responsible for ensuring that all research data can be stored on suitable and secure storage spaces and for providing sustainable infrastructure to make research data accessible in accordance with the recommendations of the Swedish Research Council (see 5.1).\\n\\n#### 5.5 Description of research data\\n\\nResearch data should be provided with standardized and machine-readable metadata in accordance with the FAIR principles in order to make the data searchable, comprehensible and reusable by others than the researcher who created it. Even in cases where research data cannot be made openly accessible, it is recommended that the researcher describes the research project using metadata to make it visible and searchable. Metadata can be published in the metadata catalogue provided by the consortium of the Swedish National Data Service (SND), in which Umeå University is included.\\n\\n#### 5.6 Research data with copyright protected material\\n\\nResearch data that contains material belonging to others and that is protected by copyright cannot be made publicly accessible but the copyright does not prevent such data from being archived and described through metadata, which in turn should be made openly accessible.\\n\\n#### 5.7 Supervision of doctoral students and students\\n\\nSupervisors are responsible for ensuring that doctoral students and students receive clear instructions for managing research data safely and correctly. In a doctoral project, doctoral students and their supervisors are together responsible for ensuring that there is a data management plan describing the routines for managing research data during and after the doctoral project. The research data management should follow this policy. Doctoral students and their supervisors are also together responsible for ensuring that research data generated in the doctoral project, which is funded by Umeå University or by a third party, is managed according to the routines of the department when doctoral students complete their doctoral studies.\\n\\n#### 5.8 Support by teaching and guidance\\n\\nUmeå University is to offer support for the correct management of research data in the form of education and information as well as by expert advice. Instructions regarding correct management of research data should also be included in the training of doctoral students at an early stage.\\n\\n#### 5.9 Access to research data when changing jobs\\n\\nIf employees change jobs and want to take a copy of the research data from the projects they have worked on at Umeå University with them, they should discuss with their head of department if and how this can be made possible. The details are to be regulated by a written agreement between the higher education institutions involved and specific terms and conditions regarding secrecy and personal data are to be noted.\\n\\n#### 5.10 Archiving and disposal of research data\\n\\nResearch data is an official document and part of the Swedish cultural heritage and must be archived indefinitely unless a decision is made to dispose of the data. Archiving of research data is to be carried out, regardless of whether research data is made accessible or not, in accordance with the current records management plan. The head of department is responsible for making decisions regarding the disposal of research data. The metadata description of research data should always be preserved, which also includes metadata that describes research data that has been disposed of.',\n",
       " '# ULB Institutional policy on Research Data Management\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nAt its Academic Council meeting of 26 April 2021, ULB adopted the following policy1 on the management of Research Data, generated and processed by Researchers as part of their research activities at ULB.\\n\\nThis policy aims to develop and promote a solid and secure management of Research Data to increase the efficiency, the quality, the integrity and the transparency of scientific research, as well as to facilitate the development of new knowledge, and to ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations, ethical and contractual obligations, and provisions of external research funding agencies. Ideally, Research Data management should be considered and integrated throughout the life cycle of the research data.\\n\\n\\n\\nFurthermore, various research funders such as the FNRS or the European Commission are increasingly requesting that a Data Management Plan accompanies any funded project. This is thus an evolution that urgently needed to be acknowledged in our institution.\\n\\nThis document represents an aspirational policy; its implementation will likely take several years and require communication and support efforts towards the scientific community\\n\\nPractical Guidelines are available on the ULB personnel portal:  \\n\\n## Definitions\\n\\nAnonymisation: Process by which personal data is irreversibly altered in such a way that a data subject can no longer be identified directly or indirectly, either by the data controller alone or in collaboration with any other party.\\n\\nArchive or Data Repository: Copy of Curated Data made for long-term usage and reference. Archived data need to be replicated in several regularly checked copies. Migration to open file formats is recommended to ensure re-usability in the long term.\\n\\nArchiving: Process of depositing data in an Archive or Data Repository for access and preservation, ensuring that data can still be found, understood, accessed, and used in the future.\\n\\nBackup: Copy of active data used to quickly restore the original data in case of accidental data deletion,  corruption or disaster recovery.\\n\\nConfidential Data: Data to which only a limited number of persons have access and which are meant for restricted use.\\n\\nCurated Data: Collected data that are organised and integrated from various sources. It involves data that are annotated, published and presented such that the value of the data is maintained over time, and the data remains available for reuse and preservation.\\n\\nData Management Plan: A living document describing how data will be generated, handled, stored, used, disseminated and archived following the FAIR principles.\\n\\nData Repository: See Archive.\\n\\nEncryption: Process of converting information or data into a cipher or code.\\n\\nFAIR Principles: FAIR stands for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable. The FAIR principles describe how research outputs should be organised to be easily accessed, understood, exchanged and reused. Major funding bodies, including the European Commission, promote FAIR data to maximise the integrity and impact of their research investment.\\n\\nGDPR: General Data Protection Regulations (link).\\n\\nGuidelines: Institutional and practical advices for Research Data management provided on the ULB website devoted to research data management.\\n\\nPersonal Data: Any information about an identified or identifiable natural person (the data subject). This definition is very broad: an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.\\n\\nPreservation: All measures taken after the Research Project ends, including financial and strategic decisions, to maintain the integrity and to extend the lifetime of data, documents or collections.\\n\\nPrincipal Investigator (PI): Experienced Researcher usually leading team members carrying out a research project under his/her scientific guidance.\\n\\nPseudonymisation: Processing of personal data in such a way that the data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional  information. More specifically, each data subject is assigned a code and the table of correspondence is kept in a separate file and is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure non-attribution to an identified or identifiable  person.\\n\\nRegistration: Process following data acquisition by which data is identified as a unit for subsequent access and processing.\\n\\nResearch Data: Data collected, observed, created or obtained from third parties by Researchers, for purposes of data analysis to produce original research information and results. Data can be raw, processed to a greater or lesser extent, or analysed, and can adopt a digital or non-digital form. Examples : software codes, equations, images, photos, audio and video recordings, survey results, excel tables, texts, etc.\\n\\nResearch Project: Scientific endeavour to answer a research question or a set of research questions. A Research Project must include a description of a defined protocol, clearly articulated goal(s), defined methods and outputs, and a defined start and end date.\\n\\nResearch Supervisor: Experienced Researcher in charge of one or a group of early stage Researchers (PhD s) and/or experienced Researchers (post-doctoral Researchers or others) or of an area of work, who is guiding the Researchers to ensure that the scientific activities are conducted according to the rules and regulations.\\n\\nResearchers: Staff members, students or persons who conduct scientific research at ULB, regardless of whether the research is internally funded or not. The term comprises statutory and contractual staff members at ULB, doctoral students, unpaid and/or voluntary researchers hosted by ULB, as well as bachelor and master students.\\n\\nRetention Period: Period during which relevant research data and accompanying documentation must be retained to verify and reproduce the scientific claims communicated by the Researcher.\\n\\nStorage: Process of keeping and depositing data on a computer system during the active phases of the Research Project.\\n\\n## Regulatory provisions\\n\\nULB has ownership and legal responsibilities of research results of any nature, whether or not they can be patented, that were obtained during any research activity, study, or service performed by one or several Researchers. For more details and exceptions:\\n\\nRegulation on ownership, protection and valorization of the intellectual property of the Université libre de Bruxelles (ULB)\\n\\nWhere research is carried out under a contract, the terms of the agreement should determine ownership and rights to disclose and exploit the results. Of note, common results acquired during the Project are considered confidential until their disclosure.\\n\\nAlthough students are not subject to the IPR regulation mentioned above, they agree to comply with the ULB IPR regulation. This implies that they agree to maintain the information and the results related to the project as strictly confidential and to disclose information to any third party only with ULB’s prior written agreement. Research results that can potentially be exploited must be dealt with the ULB Technology  Transfer Office (contact ULBTTO@ulb.be).\\n\\n### Relationship with internal policies\\n\\nResearch data will be managed in accordance with ULB’s regulations, policies and guidelines: CODE DE DÉONTOLOGIE ET D’INTÉGRITÉ EN MATIÈRE DE RECHERCHE, DE VALORISATION ET DE CRÉATION DE SPIN-OFFS\\nConseils pour la gestion des données en accord avec le Comité d’Ethique de l’ULB. Protection des données à caractère personnel (RGPD)\\nObligations regarding the confidentiality of personal data\\nBonnes pratiques informatiques à destination des membres de la Communauté universitaire Regulation on ownership, protection and valorization of the intellectual property of the Université libre de Bruxelles (ULB)\\n\\n### ULB’s commitments\\n\\n### 1. Infrastructures\\n\\nULB is committed to providing secure mechanisms and services for Storage, Backup, Registration, Deposit and Archiving of research data assets in support of current and future access and Preservation, during and after completion of Research Projects.\\n\\n### 2. Services and support\\n\\nULB is committed to providing training, support, advice and where appropriate guidelines and templates for the research data management and research Data Management Plans.\\n\\n## Researchers’ commitments\\n\\n### 1. Responsibilities\\n\\nThe Research Supervisor/Principal Investigator of a project has the ultimate responsibility for the research data management. Nevertheless, all Researchers are responsible for the careful management of the Research Data they collect, generate, and/or obtain from third parties to ensure that the data are reliable, secure, sustainable, findable, and, where possible, openly accessible.\\n\\nIt is therefore advised to create a Data Management Plan prior to a Research Project, i.e. a living document describing how data will be generated, handled, stored, used, disseminated and archived following the FAIR Principles.\\n\\nIt is strongly recommended that Researchers store their Research Data on infrastructures hosted on premises by ULB as indicated in the Guidelines.\\n\\nResearch Data that the Researchers collect or generate at ULB and the accompanying documentation must be preserved and must remain accessible to ULB during a relevant Retention Period (see below).\\n\\n### 2. Policies and regulations\\n\\nResearch data management must always respect relevant laws and regulations (e.g. on the protection of Personal Data and other Confidential Data, or on intellectual property rights...), ethical codes, and/or contractual obligations with third parties, as well as the requirements included in the applicable regulations of external research funding agencies (e.g. FNRS, Belspo, European Commission...).\\n\\nIf the regulations of the external research funding agencies or the contracts with third parties impose more stringent or specific data management requirements than the ones proposed by ULB, they will override this policy framework’s provisions unless they violate basic principles outlined in the ULB Policy of Research Data Management.\\n\\n### 3. Personal data protection\\n\\nResearchers who use Personal Data as Research Data must ensure the correct treatment and protection of these Personal Data in accordance with national and European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), as well as the ULB regulations on the protection of personal data. They must respect the basic principles of privacy protection: purpose limitation, proportionality, transparency, correct retention period, and secure destruction (after the Retention Period has expired). Technical and organizational measures to ensure secure Storage and secure processing (e.g. Anonymisation, Pseudonymisation, or Encryption) must be provided, in accordance with the institutional guidelines for working with Personal Data and confidential information in a secure manner.\\n\\nPersonal Data protection principles remain applicable throughout all the phases of the data lifecycle, including sharing, archiving, and deleting.\\n\\n### 4. Access to data\\n\\nResearchers should identify data of future historical interest, and all Research Data that represent records of ULB, including data that substantiate research findings, for deposit and retention (see below) in the ULB repository or in a compliant and secure national or international data service or domain repository in accordance with the Guidelines. Researchers must ensure that Research Data are available for access and re-use where appropriate and under adequate safeguards, including Anonymisation, Pseudonymisation, etc.\\n\\nExclusive rights to reuse or publish Research Data should not be handed over to publishers or agents without retaining the rights to make the data openly available for re-use, unless this is a condition of funding or publication.\\n\\n### 5. Data retention\\n\\n5.1. Unless provided otherwise either by legal, contractual, ethical or other specific obligations, or by requirements of external research funding agencies, relevant Research Data and accompanying documentation must be retained for a minimum of 5 years after completion of the Research Project or the project funding, or after publication of the conclusions based on the data (the latest date is applicable here). Of note, medical data related to patients must be kept for 30 years (link).\\n\\nData retention primarily concerns all Research Data and accompanying documentation which are reasonably required or appropriate to verify (and reproduce) the scientific claims communicated by the Researcher. The degree of processing of the Research Data which are to be retained will partly depend on the type of research, the kind of Research Data, and/or possible practical considerations. It can also be relevant to retain Research Data with potential value for reuse.\\n\\n5.2. Research Data and accompanying documentation which were selected for retention should be deposited in a reliable Archive or Data Repository in accordance with the institutional Guidelines to ensure secure, long-term retention and accessibility (with appropriate access rights).\\n\\nAt minimum, if Research Data is deposited in an external Archive, Researchers should supply the metadata for these Research Data in DI-fusion, the ULB institutional repository, with a link to the data in the external Archive. (See institutional Guidelines for depositing and providing access to research data available on the ULB website.)\\n\\nResearchers who are supervised (e.g. master students, doctoral students, unpaid and/or voluntary researchers) need to make prior arrangements with their research mentor, supervisor, or coordinator on where these research data will be retained, for whom they will be accessible, and how they are allowed to be used in the future.',\n",
       " \"# DATA MANAGEMENT POLICY\\n\\n## Purpose\\n\\n1. This document explains the University of Suffolk’s policy on data protection and data management and is based on the following principles:\\n\\nThe University will comply with all relevant legislation, particularly the Data Protection Act 2018 and the EU General Data Protection Regulations 2016 (“GDPR”). Ensuring compliance is a corporate responsibility of the University requiring the active involvement of, and appreciation by, all Employees and Other Workers1 at all levels of the organisation, including honorary staff/associates, contractors, hourly paid lecturers and any students or interns carrying out work on behalf of the University. The University will provide support and services to enable staff handling personal data to remain compliant with the legislation and the University’s requirements in respect of data security.\\n\\n## About the Policy\\n\\n2. At the University, personal data from a wide range of individuals is collected, analysed, stored, shared, transferred, processed and at the end of the retention period, destroyed. Personal data used in this way, is from staff, students, applicants, alumni, visitors and people taking part in our research. Maintaining the security and privacy of this personal data is essential. This policy sets out the University’s requirements as Data Controller when processing this Personal Data.\\n\\n3. This Policy is approved by the University’s Quality Committee and is subject to review every four years in line with the University’s review schedule of policies and procedures. Review will take place earlier where changes in legislation require such review.\\n\\n4. A University of Suffolk Data User is defined as staff, students and others who have access to and use Personal Data on behalf of the University. All University of Suffolk Data Users must:\\n\\ncomply with this Policy when processing Personal Data on behalf of the University recognise that they have a role to play in ensuring that the University maintains the trust and confidence of the individuals about whom the University processes personal data (including its own staff) comply with legal obligations and protect the University’s reputation.\\n\\n5. This also applies to Partnership staff or others working with or on behalf of the University of Suffolk, accessing University of Suffolk systems, with responsibilities and expectations set out in the relevant Partnerships Agreement.\\n\\n6. Disciplinary action can be taken against those who do not comply, particularly in cases when there has been deliberate, wilful, or negligent disregard of the Policy and University requirements.\\n\\n7. The University has processes in place, including this Policy, which are designed to protect the accuracy, integrity, and confidentiality of personal data and to ensure that individuals are able to exercise their rights. Appendix 1 provides more information about these other policies.\\n\\n8. Key words are defined in the Glossary of Terms in Appendix 2.\\n\\n9. If you do not feel confident in your knowledge or understanding of this Policy, or you have concerns regarding the implementation of this Policy, you should seek advice from the Data Governance Team (contact details below).\\n\\n### Training\\n\\n10. All staff must complete the University’s online Data Protection training, which is available via the University of Suffolk Online Training portal. Most staff are required to complete the module every three years. Some staff are required to complete it annually because of the nature of their work (e.g. if they work with NHS patient data). New members of staff must complete this module as part of their induction. It is the responsibility of managers to ensure that their staff complete the required training, including any additional training required (for example, for researchers), both as part of their induction and biennially thereafter, recording completion in the individual’s My Review record.\\n\\n11. Whilst some staff will have received elements of data protection training as part of their research requirements, researchers employed by the University must also complete the University’s online Data Protection Training (University of Suffolk Online Training) regardless of any previous training.\\n\\n12. The Data Governance Team regularly reviews completion records and routinely contacts those who have not completed their training. If no action is taken from this contact the Data Governance team contacts the line manager of the individual\\n\\n13. It is the responsibility of the Pro Vice-Chancellor of Research and for each supervisor of Postgraduate Research Students to ensure the University’s online Data Protection Training is undertaken by PGR students (or any additional data protection training modules identified as appropriate), at the outset of their programme or annually, and for ensuring completion. More generally the module can be made available to those students undertaking research which involves the use of personal data, as required.\\n\\n## Data Protection Principles\\n\\n14. The GDPR sets out principles that the University must observe and comply with when processing Personal Data. The GDPR requires that personal data shall:\\n\\na. be processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner\\nb. be collected only for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes\\nc. be adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which it is to be processed\\nd. be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date\\ne. not be kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the data is processed\\nf. be processed in a manner than ensures its security using appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accident loss, destruction or damage\\ng. not be transferred to a country outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) without appropriate safeguards being in place\\n\\nFurther information on the Data Protection Principles can be found on the Information Commissioner’s website (ICO - Data Protection Principles).\\n\\n15. The University and its staff who process or use personal data must be able to demonstrate compliance with all the above principles.\\n\\n## Accountability and Governance\\n\\n16. The University is responsible for, and must be able to demonstrate, compliance with the GDPR and data protection.\\n\\n17. There are several actions the University, and its Data Users, can and, in some cases, must take to meet this data protection principle, including:\\n\\nImplementation of Data Management Policy\\nTaking a ‘data protection by design and default’ approach\\nEnsuring that written contracts are in place with organisations that process personal data\\non the University’s behalf\\nMaintaining documentation of all University processing activities\\nImplementing appropriate security measures\\nRecording and reporting personal data breaches to the data governance team\\nCarrying out data protection impact assessments (DPIAs) where the use of personal data\\nis likely to result in a high risk to individuals’ interests\\nAppointment of a Data Protection Officer\\nAdherence to relevant codes of conduct and signing up to certification schemes\\n\\n### Registering with the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) as a Data Controller\\n\\n18. As an organisation that processes personal and special category data, the University is required to register with the ICO. Since 2006 the University has featured on the ICO’s Register of data protection fee payers with registration number Z9376827 as a public authority data controller.\\n\\n### Data Protection Officer\\n\\n19. The University’s Data Protection Officer, supported by the Data Governance Team, advises the University on data protection law, monitors compliance, provides advice to Data Users, and ensures that guidance, training, and resources are available to Data Users.  The Data Protection Officer is the point of contact for individuals wishing to exercise their rights in relation to their data, and for any contact with the ICO.  Contact details for the Data Protection Officer and their team who deal with general queries and Subject Access Requests are as follows:\\n\\nData Protection Officer datagovernance@uos.ac.uk 01473 338240\\n\\n### Legal basis for processing\\n\\n20. Whenever the University processes personal data there must be a valid lawful basis for that processing. There are six lawful bases for general processing of Personal Data and ten lawful bases for processing Special Category Data. If Special Category Data is being processed, both a lawful basis for general processing and an additional condition for processing this type of data must be identified. These are listed in full in Appendix 3.\\n\\n21. Further sources of advice and guidance are set out in Appendix 4.\\n\\n22. In practice, for many of the University’s activities it will rely on the legal basis that the ‘processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest’ as this covers our work as a university in teaching and research. However sometimes the University will need to rely on alternative bases, and these will be documented in the Data Privacy Impact Assessment carried out in respect of the specific activity.\\n\\n### Profiling and Automated Decision Making\\n\\n23. The ICO has produced guidance (Automated decision-making and profiling) on Profiling and Automated Decision Making which is available on its website and should be taken into account before considering any activity or task which involves Profiling or Automated Decision Making.\\n\\n24. Before starting a task or activity which involves Profiling or Automated Decision Making, the following steps must be carried out:\\n\\na. A Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) must be carried out. The Data Governance Team must be informed and consulted as part of that exercise\\nb. A Privacy Notice must inform individuals if their data will be used for solely automated decision-making processes with legal or similarly significant effects. This must explicitly set out the Data Subject’s rights. The Privacy Notice should be approved and held by the Data Governance Team.\\nc. The DPIA must be kept under regular review, and records of those reviews must be retained.\\n\\n### Data Protection by Design and Data Privacy Impact Assessments (DPIAs)\\n\\n25. An aspect of the accountability and governance data protection principle, the University must ensure that consideration is given to the protection of data from design through the life cycle of the process or system.\\n\\n26. It is therefore the responsibility of any University member introducing or designing a new process or system, to take account of the data protection principles and ensure that data protection laws are complied with and can be demonstrated. Information pertaining to the University DPIA process can be found by staff on The Hub.\\n\\n27. A DPIA enables Data Users to identify and minimise the data protection risks of a project. A DPIA must be completed for any data processing that is likely to result in a high risk to individuals. It is also good practice to complete a DPIA for major projects which will require the processing of personal data.\\n\\n28. A DPIA should:\\n\\nProvide a description of the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing\\nAssess necessity, proportionality and compliance measures\\nIdentify and assess risks to individuals\\nIdentify additional measures required to mitigate the risks\\n\\n29. Further information about DPIAs is available on the ICO website (ICO - Data Protection Impact Assessments).\\n\\n30. DPIAs should be shared with the Data Protection Officer (datagovernance@uos.ac.uk) prior to sign-off and commencement of the project.\\n\\n### Data Retention\\n\\n31. Data at the University of Suffolk are retained and disposed of according to need. The overarching principle is that data should only be retained and stored for as long as such data have a legitimate purpose, and thereafter they should be disposed of securely. Each School and Professional Service area of the Institution holds a Data Retention Schedule which specifies the nature of the data retained, the retention period, the reason for retention, and the action to be taken at the end of the retention period, including how the data are to be disposed of.\\n\\n32. At the end of the retention period, data should be disposed of and/or destroyed. Manual confidential waste must be placed in the lockable confidential waste bins located across campus (please see list of locations under Estates and Sustainability on Hub) and not in general paper recycling bins.\\n\\nUNIVERSITY OF SUFFOLK\\n\\n## Appendix 1:  University Policies\\n\\nData Security Policy\\nCode of Practice for Managing Freedom of Information Requests\\nDigital & IT:  Acceptable Use of IT Policy\\nDigital & IT:  Mobile Device Use Policy\\nEmployees and Other Workers Privacy Notice\\nResearch Governance\\n\\n## Appendix 2: Glossary of Terms\\n\\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Automated Decision-Making</td><td>A decision made by automated means without any human involvement</td></tr><tr><td>Consent</td><td>Agreement which is freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous</td></tr><tr><td>CriminalOffencesData</td><td>Data relating to criminal convictions and offences or related security measures.</td></tr><tr><td>DataBreach</td><td>The destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data.

Processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that at least one of the following applies:\\n\\na. The Data Subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes.\\nb. Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the Data Subject prior to entering into a contract.\\nc. Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Data Controller is subject.\\nd. Processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the Data Subject or of another natural person.\\ne. Processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the Data Controller.\\nf. Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Data Controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the Data Subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the Data Subject is a child. (This does not apply to processing carried out by public authorities, such as Universities, in the performance of their public tasks).\\n\\n2. There are 10 legal bases on which Special Category Personal Data may be processed:\\n\\na. The Data Subject has given explicit consent to the processing of those personal data for one or more specified purposes.\\nb. Processing is necessary for the purposes of carrying out the obligations and rights of the Data Controller or of the Data Subject in the field of employment and social security (subject to the Data Protection Act 2018).\\nc. Processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the Data Subject or of another natural person where the data subject is physically or legally incapable of giving consent.\\nd. Processing is carried out in the course of its legitimate activities with appropriate safeguards by a foundation, association or any other not-for-profit body with a political, philosophical, religious or trade union aim and on condition that the processing relates solely to the members or to former members of the body or to persons who have regular contact with it in connection with its purposes and that the personal data are not disclosed outside that body without the consent of the Data Subjects; 12 Revised Data Protection Policy 27.06.2018.\\ne. Processing relates to personal data which are manifestly made public by the Data Subject.\\nf. Processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims or whenever courts are acting in their judicial capacity.\\ng. Processing is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest, on the basis of Union or Member State law which shall be proportionate to the aim pursued, respect the essence of the right to data protection and provide for suitable and specific measures to safeguard the fundamental rights and the interests of the Data Subject.\\nh. Processing is necessary for the purposes of preventive or occupational medicine, for the assessment of the working capacity of the employee, medical diagnosis, the provision of health or social care or treatment or the management of health or social care systems and services on the basis of Union or Member State law or pursuant to contract with a health professional and subject to safeguards.\\ni. Processing is necessary for reasons of public interest in the area of public health, such as protecting against serious cross-border threats to health or ensuring high standards of quality and safety of health care and of medicinal products or medical devices, on the basis of Union or Member State law which provides for suitable and specific measures to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the Data Subject, in particular professional secrecy; L 119/38 EN Official Journal of the European Union 4.5.2016.

       " '# Research Data Management – UCD Policy\\n\\nPolicy owner UCD Research & Innovation\\n\\nApproval date and body GA, 25th June 2020\\n\\n## 1. Purpose\\n\\nUniversity College Dublin recognises that the management of research data is fundamental to both high quality research and academic integrity. Accurate and retrievable research data is an essential component of any research project and is necessary to verify and defend the process and outcomes of research.\\n\\nResearch data is valuable to researchers for the duration of their research, and may well have longterm value for research, teaching and for wider exploitation for the public good by individuals, government, business and other organisations.\\n\\nThe objective of the Research Data Management (RDM) Policy is to provide a framework for the management of research data to ensure that research data is stored, retained, made available for use and reuse, and disposed of according to best international practices for data management, as well as in compliance with legal, statutory, ethical, contractual and intellectual property obligations, and the requirements of funding bodies and publishers.\\n\\n## 2. Definitions\\n\\n### UCD Community means\\n\\nall UCD employees, whether part time or full time, permanent or temporary;\\nall employees of UCD’s wholly owned subsidiary companies or overseas campus/offices; all registered students of UCD;\\nnon-University employees who use University funds, facilities or other resources, including the University’s name and reputation, to carry out teaching and/or research, and/or participate in UCD-administered research, including retired employees, visiting faculty and researchers; consultants, contractors, affiliated hospital staff, industrial personnel and research fellows, regardless of obligations to other companies or institutions; and\\nall persons conducting teaching and/or research at or under the auspices of UCD including at any of UCD’s overseas campus, including visiting faculty and researchers; consultants; contractors, Emeritus or adjunct appointments; and research fellows.\\n\\nResearchers are defined as members of the UCD Community carrying out research.\\n\\nResearch data is information collected to be examined and considered, and to serve as a basis for reasoning, discussion or calculation. It is used as a primary source to support technical or scientific enquiry, research, scholarship, or artistic activity, is used as evidence in the research process, and/or is commonly accepted in the research community as necessary to validate research findings and results. Examples of research data are experimental data, observational data, operational data, third party data, public sector data, monitoring data, or repurposed data.  The focus in this policy is on research data that is available in either electronic or paper form.\\n\\nResearch data lifecycle is the sequence of stages that a particular unit of data goes through from its initial generation or capture to its eventual archival and/or deletion at the end of its planned life.\\n\\nA secure environment is a system or facility which implements the controlled storage and use of research data.\\n\\nA data management plan or DMP is a formal document that outlines how data is to be handled both during a research project and after the project is completed. Data management plans must assure that research data is traceable, available, authentic, citable, properly stored and that it adheres to clearly defined legal parameters and appropriate safety measures governing subsequent use.\\n\\n## 3. Scope\\n\\nThe scope of the policy covers research data created or managed by Researchers.\\n\\n## 4. Principles\\n\\n(1) The University promotes best practice for research data management through clear policy, guidance, supervision, training and support.\\n(2) Researchers, service providers and, where appropriate, research sponsors and external collaborators should work in partnership to implement good practice.\\n(3) Research data will be managed by Researchers to the highest standards throughout the research data lifecycle as part of the University’s commitment to research excellence.\\n(4) Research data should be compliant to the principles of FAIR data (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Re-Useable): Findable: Identifiable, retrievable, and available when needed; Accessible: Able to be made available to others in line with appropriate legal, statutory (including data protection regulations), ethical, contractual, intellectual property, data sharing and open access principles in a suitable repository or archiving system with persistent identifiers. Interoperable: Should be accurate, complete, authentic and reliable, and where possible made available in non-proprietary formats that facilitate data exchange and re-use; Re-Useable: Assigned a licence for open use where possible in compliance with intellectual property rights, and if no third-party rights, data protection, legal requirements or property laws prohibit it.\\n(5) Research data should be kept in a manner that is compliant with legal and ethical obligations and, where applicable, the requirements of funding bodies, publishers and protocols set out in the National Policy Statement on Ensuring Research Integrity in Ireland.\\n(6) Research data should be retained in a secure environment for as long as it is of continuing value to the researcher and the wider research community, and as long as specified by research funder, publisher, patent law, legislative and other regulatory requirements. The normal minimum retention period for research data is ten years after publication or public release of the work of the research. (Longer periods apply in certain cases, such as in relation to historical data.) If data includes personal or sensitive information, informants must be informed of the data retention policy at the time data is collected, in compliance with data protection regulations.\\n\\n(7) If research data is to be deleted or destroyed, either because the agreed period of retention has expired or for legal or ethical reasons, this should be done so in accordance with all legal, ethical, research funder and collaborator requirements and with particular concern for confidentiality and security.\\n\\n(8) If a personal data breach occurs, it is to be dealt with in accordance with UCD data protection policies.\\n\\n(9) Increasingly, research projects are funded by external parties and/or involve collaboration with third parties such as other research performing organisations, charities, industry, etc.  In such cases, contractual requirements such as the funder’s terms and conditions, grant agreement(s), collaboration agreement(s), industry contract(s) etc. may apply to the project. These contractual requirements constitute legally binding obligations on the University and the Researchers involved in the project, and often include specific provisions regarding ownership, management, retention and access to data, confidentiality obligations, IT security, publication requirements etc.  Contractual obligations apply in addition to the principles and requirements contained in this policy.  If there is a conflict between this policy and a contractual obligation, the contractual obligation will override the requirements of this policy and it is the researcher’s responsibility to ensure compliance.\\n\\n## 5. Roles and responsibilities\\n\\nResearchers are responsible for:\\n\\nManaging research data in accordance with the principles above;\\nDeveloping and documenting clear procedures for the collection, storage, use, re-use, access and retention or destruction of the research data and records associated with their research. This shall include, where appropriate, defining protocols and responsibilities in a joint or multiinstitution collaborative research project. This information should be incorporated, where appropriate, in a research data management plan. For research that includes personal data, the researcher needs to identify what contracts or agreements with collaborators or contractors are required to satisfy data protection obligations;\\nPlanning for the ongoing custodianship (at the University or using third-party services) of their data after the completion of the research or, in the event of their departure or retirement from the University, reaching agreement with the Head of School/Institute Director (or their nominee) as to where such data will be located and how this will be stored. Where personal data is part of the research data, it has to be assured that any agreement made is in line with the communication provided to and reasonable expectations of research participants;\\nEnsuring that any requirements in relation to research data management placed on their research by publishers, funding bodies or regulatory agencies or under the terms of a research contract with the University are also met.\\n\\nThe University provides resources to facilitate Researchers in meeting their responsibilities, in the form of supporting services and expert advice as well as technical infrastructures. Information on available supports is available at the online UCD Research Portal. The University is committed to, and will maintain oversight of, good practice in research data management. To this end, it reserves the right to verify that all research data has been kept in a manner that is compliant with this policy and, where applicable, the requirements of funding bodies and publishers.\\n\\n## 6. Personal data and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)\\n\\nThe General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into force on 25 May 2018.  It is intended to strengthen data protection for individuals across the EU, and imposes increased obligations on organisations that process personal data.  Processing is very broadly defined as the collection, storage, recording, disclosure of, structuring, making available and erasure or destruction.  The GDPR applies to the processing of personal data by controllers and processors in the EU, regardless of whether or not the processing takes place in the EU, and furthermore it restricts the transfer of personal data to locations outside the EU unless certain conditions or safeguards are in place. At the core of the GDPR are seven principles which must be observed by all data controllers and processors. These are transparency, purpose limitation, data minimisation, accuracy, storage limitation, integrity and confidentiality and accountability.\\n\\nThe definition of personal data is broad under the GDPR and encompasses “any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person”.  The GDPR specifically includes “location data”, “online identifiers” such as IP addresses and “genetic” data as examples of personal data. Certain categories of personal data attract a greater level of protection under the GDPR. These include: personal data relating to racial/ethnic origin, political opinions, religious/philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, health and biometric data, and data concerning sex life or sexual orientation.  However, the GDPR does not apply to fully anonymised or aggregated data where a living individual cannot under any circumstances ever be identified or singled out.\\n\\nIf your research data includes personal data as defined under the GDPR it is very important that the following are consulted: Article 9 of GDPR, UCD GDPR website and the Health Research Board’s GDPR guidance for researchers.\\n\\n## 7.

Description\\n\\nAn important ambition of UMC Utrecht is \\'Open Science \\' for better health care and social involvement.  This is about \\'open access\\' (free access to scientific publications), \\'open data\\' and reuse of scientific data, making science more efficient, more widely applicable and reproducible. Data is the foundation of scientific research. Throughout the research cycle, the quality and durability of data must therefore be ensured through careful management. If the quality and durability of data is not in order, the research is not reproducible. Making the data ‘open’ and reusable is not considered.  Research Data Management (RDM) deals with the collection, documentation, processing, storage, sustainable archiving and reusability of the research data. Funders and publishers also take part in above ambition and ask for a data management plan, wherein the researcher demonstrates that the data to be collected, will be available for reuse in the future.\\n\\nThe policy is based on the following documents:\\n\\nThe Research Code of UMC Utrecht\\nPrivacy Regulations of UMC Utrecht\\nThe General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the General Data Protection Regulation Implementation Act\\nThe Handbook for Adequate Natural Datastewardship (HANDS), prepared by the Dutch Federation of University medical centers (NFU).\\n\\n### 1.3. Target audience\\n\\nAll employees involved in scientific research must read and comply with this policy, in particular: department heads, managers research, researchers, quality coordinators, policy advisors, data managers, research coordinators and research nurses .\\n\\n### 1.4. Application area\\n\\nThe scope of this policy document is the data management of all scientific research, which is carried out under the responsibility of UMC Utrecht. This also concerns multicenter research in which an external party bears the main responsibility, and the UMC Utrecht collects data as a participating center.\\n\\n### 1.5. Roles and Responsibilities\\n\\nThe roles and responsibilities are described in the Research Data Governance Model.\\n\\n### 1.6. Aim\\n\\nEstablishing this policy must guide all involved parties in the adequate design and implementation of Research Data Management.\\n\\n## 2. Principles\\n\\n### 1. FAIR data\\n\\nFor all scientific output we strive for the highest possible degree of \\'Fairness\\', where FAIR stands for:\\n\\nFindable: datasets are findable, provided with a persistent identifier1 and sufficient metadata2, with which specific datasets can be found;\\nAccessible: datasets are accessible, either at data level or at metadata level, and clear user conditions have been drawn up;\\nInteroperable: datasets are interchangeable and standard terminologies and vocabularies are used wherever possible;\\nReusable: datasets are reusable, meet the above criteria and are sufficiently described, so that reuse is scientifically and ethically sound.\\n\\n### 2. Privacy by Default/ Privacy by Design\\n\\nThe use of personal data for research is based on:\\n\\nA. Privacy by Default : the chosen standard method maximally guarantees the privacy of the data subject3 (such as use of standard research folder design). The Privacy by Default idea is built into the technology of, for example, data collection and other work processes.\\nB. Privacy by Design: consider privacy when designing the study (such as minimizing the amount of personal data and pseudonymising as soon as possible).\\n\\n### 3. Dataminimization\\n\\nNot only in the context of privacy laws, but also in the context of efficiency and scientific integrity, the collection of research data (and in particular of personal data) needs to be demonstrably legitimate, fit for the purpose of the study, and contain no irrelevant data. However, some research requires a broader collection of data (for example to find accidental discoveries in a certain clinical picture in cohort studies). This is described in the Data Management Plan.\\n\\n### 4. Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)\\n\\nA DPIA4 ensures that the impact of the intended project on the privacy of those involved and the risks for those involved and for the organization is considered before the start of the project. For processing of health information that is directly or indirectly traceable to the person (sensitive personal data), we assume that the outcome of a DPIA will be \\'high risk\\' . Therefore, for each study it is described which measures will be taken to minimize the impact on the privacy of the study participants. This is described in the Data Management Plan.\\n\\n### 5. Research Data in control\\n\\nIn line with the general standards of the Netherlands Code of Conduct for Research Integrity 2018 it is ensured that data sources are verifiable, that there is an honest and transparent description of the data collection, that both raw and final data are carefully stored and that the data are as FAIR as possible.  It is also ensured that all data and research materials are collected with the appropriate infrastructure, that they are archived in a sustainable manner and are as ‘open’ as possible and as ‘closed’ (confidential) as necessary.\\n\\n### 6. Data Sharing Statement\\n\\nIn the context of Open Science, the sharing of scientific data with other researchers is encouraged.  A data sharing statement is a statement about which research data will be shared after completion of the research, how the data will be made available and under which conditions this will be done.  The data sharing statement provides a good description of why data can or cannot be shared and is therefore a compulsory part of the Data Management Plan for all scientific research. This requires compliance with laws and regulations in the field of privacy. This is based on the principle \"As open as possible, as closed as necessary\".\\n\\n### 7. Researchers access to data expertise\\n\\nLike other Dutch UMCs, UMC Utrecht follows the NFU Guidelines for data stewardship. We view data as legitimate and citable products of research, and are transparent about how the data can be viewed or used6. The support of researchers by data management experts is organized differently per division.  In the coming year, data stewardship will be formalized, as described by NFU Data4lifesciences, to provide a more policyoriented approach to data management within the Divisions.\\n\\n## 3. Implementation framework\\n\\n3.1. Preparation of the research\\n\\n### 3.1.1. Data Management Plan (DMP)\\n\\nIn the context of integrity and transparency of research and FAIR data for Open Science, UMC Utrecht researchers are required to fill in a DMP for scientific research7 using the UMC Utrecht specific DMP template, unless a funder has a mandatory template8. The UMC Utrecht DMP template supports researchers with examples of answers, and with information about the specific subjects.  Data managers can be consulted if necessary.  With this , the UMC Utrecht aims for transparency in data management processes and compliance with legislation and regulations. The content of the DMP is in line with national and international initiatives9.\\n\\n### 3.1.2. Storage and organization of files\\n\\nFor research purposes, UMC Utrecht offers the Research Folder Structure. Separate storage of personal data and research data is possible here. The storage location is recorded in the Data Management Plan. The storage location is under management at UMC Utrecht unless otherwise stated in the Data Management Plan. The principal investigator is responsible for the proper management of the research folders. The organization and access to folders is carried out by an authorized employee on behalf of the principal investigator.\\n\\n### 3.2.2. Registration of research participation\\n\\nIn view of patient safety, it is important that every participation in scientific research is registered in the electronic patient database (EPD). This also applies to healthy volunteers. In case, for valid reasons, it is not desirable to register healthy subjects in the EPD, one can deviate from registration in the EPD ( see SOP Performing WMO-study). This must be documented in the DMP.\\n\\n### 3.2.3. Re-use of data\\n\\nRe-use of healthcare data (retrospective studies) is possible after pseudonymization of the data (see also 3.3.2). Data that are collected in healthcare, are made available for research in the Research Data Platform (RDP). For specific expertise and guided searches in sources one can use the Utrecht Patient Oriented Database (UPOD). Making data available for reuse must always comply with applicable laws and regulations. For the use of external data sources for research, researchers turn to the supplier of the data and jointly draw up a Data Access Agreement. Often this is based on documents from the supplier.\\n\\n### 3.2.4. Raw data storage\\n\\nCollected data, whether this has been done via re-use or via new data collection,  needs to be stored and frozen (read only) as \\'raw data\\' immediately after collection. Raw data are not to be edited or changed. This is necessary, so that, at any time, one can trace back to the original data.\\n\\n### 3.3. Data preparation\\n\\n#### 3.3.1. Validation\\n\\nAll adaptations for validation and preparation of a suitable dataset for analysis are documented in such a way that the research results are verifiable. For all scientific research it is mandatory to keep an audit trail. When the raw data consists of care data which are erroneously recorded in the electronic patient files (EPD), the usual care processes are followed to adjust that information.  This means that only the care provider can change this data, and not the researcher.\\n\\n#### 3.3.2. Anonymize/Pseudonymize\\n\\nDirectly identifying personal data must be stored separately from the research data, and research data must be anonymised or pseudonymised. Care data are almost always indirectly traceable to the person and completely anonymizing will therefore often not be possible.  A pseudonymised file can indirectly be traced back to a natural person, as long as a key file exists. An important reason to still pseudonymise data is that this removes the direct traceability to a person. Technical facilities (such as the RDP and the Research Folder Structure) and procedural provisions ensure that the researcher does not have access to the directly identifying data.  In case of indirect traceability to a person in research files, appropriate measures are taken to remove the indirect traceability to an individual when publishing or sharing data10.\\n\\n#### 3.3.3. Storage of analysis file\\n\\nAfter validation and preparation, and before final analysis and reporting, the analysis file is to be frozen. The analysis file is pseudonymised, or anonymized. For separate storage of personal data and research data, the Research Folder Structure can be used.  In a frozen data collection it is no longer allowed to change or add data. Statistical analyses are only performed on the frozen datasets.\\n\\n#### 3.3.4. Requirements for data storage\\n\\nFor all types of research, the storage location is physically and digitally protected. The policy of UMC Utrecht regarding information security is described in the Information Security Directive. UMC Utrecht provides a number of storage locations that meet these requirements, such as bulk storage and departmental disks.  The DMP must describe where the data is stored, so that it is clear for every employee in the research team, where the data can be found.\\n\\n#### 3.3.5. Data exchange during a study\\n\\nExchanging data with internal colleagues and external partners during a study, is done in a safe manner according to the regulations of the UMC Utrecht, which can be found under this link. Prior to the exchange\\n\\nand sharing of data with external parties, a Data Transfer Agreement has been drawn up, which establishes the conditions under which data are shared.\\n\\n### 3.4. Metadata and Documentation\\n\\nMetadata provide the information needed to enable a broad scientific community to find, share and understand the content and context of a dataset.  When compiling metadata, standardization is sought as much as possible.  With the mandatory DMP, UMC Utrecht supports researchers in the implementation of good metadata of research data, which is a prerequisite for FAIR data.\\n\\n### 3.5. Data Analysis\\n\\nThe scripts for data analysis are saved and commented (thus creating an audit trail), so that, when the script is read by an experienced colleague researcher/statistician/data analyst, it is completely clear why the steps in the analysis have been taken and which choices have been made.\\n\\n### 3.6. Data Archiving\\n\\n#### 3.6.1. Transfer of custody after completion\\n\\nWhen a principal investigator leaves after completion of the research, the management of the research folder and all data must be transferred to the new responsible person or to the department head.  Data collected for scientific research, in which UMC Utrecht is end responsible or performs part of the research, are stored in storage locations managed by UMC Utrecht, unless other contractual agreements have been made about this.\\n\\n10 Suitable measures, e.g. aggregation of data (use of birth year in stead of birth date) or minimization of data in light of ‘the more variables you combine, the higher the risk of indirect identification’.\\n\\n#### 3.6.2. Documentation and Publication\\n\\nTo ensure that all relevant data remain accessible, detailed agreements must be made prior to the start of the study, about all relevant data and the format in which they will be made available or transferred after the study has ended (see also ICH-GCP 4.9. 0, 4.9.4 and 4.9.5.). In order to archive the research data, a data package is created, consisting of data, metadata and documentation.  Which specific metadata and documents are archived, depends on the type of research. The data package contains all information for the research to be replicated. The Data Management Plan and the Division Datamanager offer support in the selection of files in a data package.\\n\\n#### 3.6.3. Storage period\\n\\nConcerning the retention period, there are different legal standards for different types of research: this is at least 15 years for research with humans (Basic Selection Document), unless otherwise contracted. Anonymous datasets receive, with applicable conditions, an infinite storage period by depositing the sets in a dedicated archive (see Data Archiving), so that the data is available for future scientific research.\\n\\n#### 3.6.4. Data Archiving\\n\\nData storage and data archiving is not the same. Data can be stored safely, but this does not mean that data will be findable and accessible in the future. Data archiving, on the other hand, is about the sustainable accessibility of the research data, where the data are provided with metadata, documentation and a persistent identifier. Subsequently, it is decided where the data and/or metadata will be archived for sustainable accessibility.  This does not necessarily mean that the data is available to everyone, see Data Sharing. Global accessible data archives include: DANS, 4TUdatacentrum, SURFSARA, CLARIN (NWO), EMBLEBI.\\n\\n### 3.7. Data Sharing\\n\\n#### 3.7.1. Accessibility\\n\\nIn addition to open access to publications, accessibility of the underlying research data is stimulated, within the framework of the privacy legislation, the control rights of the study participants and the contractual agreements with third parties and funders.  For each separate study, the data access policy will have to be determined and described in the Data Sharing Statement (one of the principles of Research Data Management). Agreements about sharing data with a specific third party (both during the research and after publishing the research results) are contractually written in a Data Transfer Agreement.\\n\\n#### 3.7.2. Trusted Third Party (TTP)\\n\\nFor linking research data and data from external parties at patient level, a TTP is used, or, if possible, similar technological or procedural solutions within the UMC Utrecht.\\n\\n## 4.

       " '# University of Aberdeen Research Data Management Policy Supporting Researcher-Centred Data Management at the University of Aberdeen\\n\\nAs an organisation which creates and uses knowledge to make a difference, the University of Aberdeen wishes to make its research outputs (publications and the underlying research data) as freely available as possible, with the minimum of delay.  At the same time, we ensure that we meet all legislative and ethical obligations to protect the rights and privacy of individuals and minimize the potential for harm. We comply with UKRI’s Common Principles on Data Policy and the Concordat on Open Research Data.0F1\\n\\nManaging and sharing research data effectively is fundamental to facilitating high quality research practice, supporting our commitment to research excellence and good research governance.\\n\\nThe University outlines below the main principles of the policy for the appropriate management and sharing of all research data1F2 that is generated as a result of University research activity, throughout the life of the project and beyond, to ensure that researchers comply with legislative, funding body, data owner, and internal policy and audit requirements, and that, where appropriate, the data remains discoverable, available and usable over time, for future validation, access and re-use.\\n\\nThe University aims to support the open research agenda for both data and publications to make data more accessible to researchers and to share resources across institutions in order to create impact, recognition, curation, and influence, and ensure longevity and visibility.\\n\\n## Scope\\n\\nThe policy applies to all staff that are authorised to use the University’s name and services in the course of their research, including postgraduate students and visiting, honorary, and emeritus staff.  It also applies to staff supervising student research projects. University use of NHS and clinical data is subject to additional governance.\\n\\n## Roles and Responsibilities\\n\\n1. The Principal Investigator (PI) is responsible for compliance with this and related policies, research data management practice2F3 deposition and publication, in accordance with relevant University policies, legislation, funder, and data owner terms and conditions.  Where the research is externally funded, and the funders allow, the Principal Investigator is responsible for the recovery of costs of data storage and curation.  Principal Investigators are also required to participate in relevant training offered by the University of Aberdeen.\\n\\n2. All research data gathered by students during their study are the responsibility of the supervising staff member (PI/lead supervisor), to manage in accordance with the requirements of this policy and institutional guidance.\\n\\n3. Effective research data management practice3F4 is a shared responsibility between individual researchers, University management, and professional services.\\n\\n4. The University will provide support, guidance, and information on appropriate research data management activities, including planning for funding applications, availability of internal and external data repositories, licensing of datasets, and allocation of persistent identifiers for data sets.  Further guidance on the associated roles and responsibilities for this policy is available here.\\n\\n### Deposit and Publication\\n\\n5. All research data of potential current or future interest, or that which substantiates published research findings, should be assessed by the Principal Investigator for deposit in an appropriate data repository.\\n\\n6. The Principal Investigator has a responsibility to assess which research data should be offered for deposit; to identify an appropriate repository; to specify appropriate levels of access to the data; and to consult relevant third parties (e.g. research participants; academic and non-academic partners) in making these decisions.\\n\\n7. Research data should be published/made publicly accessible as soon as possible, and typically on publication of the results.  Embargo periods are acceptable and should take account of funders’ requirements, disciplinary practice, and commercial value.  It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator or successor data owner to adhere to funder requirements for data publishing and, where necessary, to negotiate an extension to restrictions on placing data in the public domain.\\n\\n8. When a data set is published, the Principal Investigator or data owner is required to select an appropriate licence under which their data will be made available.  The Principal Investigator or data owner will need to ensure that the licence permits sharing and re-use of data in accordance with funder requirements and the terms and conditions of this policy.  Institutional support and guidance are available here.  Electronic data published in the institutional repository will be catalogued using structured metadata which includes details of licencing and a persistent digital object identifier (DOI).\\n\\n9. The University of Aberdeen retains the right to re-use research data or make it openly available for others to re-use.  Exclusive rights to re-use or publish research data should therefore not be handed over to commercial publishers or agents without retaining the rights to make the data openly available for re-use, unless this is a condition of funding or other agreed third-party rights.\\n\\n10. A central record of known datasets deposited in public access repositories, including our institutional repositories, will be maintained in the institutional research information system.  The deposit of a data set in an external publicly accessible repository should be notified to (opendata@abdn.ac.uk)  to enable the cataloguing of metadata.\\n\\n### Data Management Practice\\n\\n11. All personal data4F5 must be collected and managed in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation ((EU) 2016/679) and the UK Data Protection Act 2018, or successive legislation. Standards and procedures for processing personal data are set out in the University of Aberdeen Data Protection Policy.\\n\\n12. Where required, research proposals should include a Data Management Plan 5F6 (DMP), or equivalent protocol for the management of data, that addresses key elements of data management practice throughout the research project and for the longer term.\\n\\n13. Data retention, preservation, accessibility, and deletion will be managed in line with relevant legislation, policies, contractual obligations, funder requirements and, where appropriate, in line with consent obtained from research subjects.\\n\\n13.1 Holding data for longitudinal studies or to enable data collection and aggregation over time, as defined by the project, can also be considered, but must take account of all the above.\\n13.2 In any case, data should be retained for a minimum of 5 years from project end date.\\n13.3 Data should not be kept any longer than is necessary without reasonable justification and appropriate authorisation/consent.\\n\\n14. Where funders allow, all costs associated with data management practice should be recovered from funders.\\n\\n## Related policies\\n\\n15.

This policy is binding on all University members engaged in research, including staff and PGR students, but does not apply to postgraduate taught and undergraduate students, except where there is a reasonable prospect that their research findings are/will be included in published research outputs.\\n2. Before a project begins, a research Data Management Plan (DMP) must be completed.\\n3. Data collected during a project must be stored on the University network, to ensure it is suitably protected against accidental loss or damage and against unauthorised access.\\n4. Data with acknowledged long-term value must be preserved and also made openly accessible with as few restrictions as possible unless there are compelling reasons not to be so.\\n5. A metadata record describing retained data must be made publically available via Pure, within 12 months of the data being generated, even if access to the final dataset(s) itself is restricted.\\n6. Research publications must include a data access statement.\\n7. In line with UKRI policies, researchers are entitled to a limited period of privileged access to the data they collect to allow them to work on and publish their results.\\n8. Data that cannot be digitised must also be registered in Pure, stored securely and organised in a manner that would facilitate it being shared in the event of a valid request for access being received.\\n9. Use of others’ data should always conform to legal, ethical and regulatory frameworks including appropriate acknowledgement.\\n10. Data must always be managed, throughout its lifecycle, in compliance with all relevant legal, ethical, and regulatory frameworks, and in the case of personal information, the provisions of legislation and University policy relating to GDPR.\\n\\n## Research Data Management Policy\\n\\n### Purpose\\n\\nThis policy aims to ensure that our research data management practices meet the highest standards and are aligned with the UKRI Research Council Common Principles on Data Policy1, and the Concordat on Open Research Data.2 It sets out the University’s expectations so that all stakeholders recognise their responsibilities and obligations and can contribute to data being maintained and preserved as identifiable, discoverable, retrievable and reusable assets.\\n\\n### Scope\\n\\nThis policy is binding on all University members engaged in research, including staff and research students, and those who are conducting research on behalf of the University. The Policy does not apply to postgraduate taught and undergraduate students, except where their research findings are included in published research outputs.\\n\\n### Implementation\\n\\nAn evolutionary approach will be taken to implementing this policy with a target date of 2022 set for full implementation. A research data roadmap will help the University achieve this goal and progress will be reviewed regularly. Initially, priority will be given to ensuring funder requirements are met and/or to research where the results have potential for publication. For funded projects, the requirements of this policy are mandatory from the date of this policy onwards.\\n\\nThe University expects all research data with potential long-term value will eventually be managed to the same standards, but recognises that extending the scope of this policy beyond those engaged in funded research will be a longer-term endeavour.\\n\\nIn light of the pace of change in this field, this policy will be reviewed 12-months from the date of approval.\\n\\n### Principles\\n\\n1. Good data management is fundamental to all stages of the research process and the highest standards must be applied throughout the data lifecycle, from creation to preservation or disposal.\\n2. Data with acknowledged long-term value should be preserved and be made discoverable and openly available with as few restrictions as possible in a timely and responsible manner.\\n3. Open access will not be possible in cases where there are justified and justifiable legal, ethical and commercial constraints on data release.\\n4. Conditions of grant from individual funding bodies with specific guidelines and obligations will take precedence in the event of any uncertainty on a project’s data management requirements.\\n5. The researchers’ entitlement to be the first to publish based on data they have generated will b preserved.\\n\\n# Abertay University\\n\\n## Research Data Management Policy\\n\\n6. It is recognised that types of data used, collected and generated will vary between disciplines and therefore the application of this policy will be sensitive to these differences while ensuring that best practice is promoted and funder requirements are met.\\n7. Researchers need to be aware of best practice measures for personal data collection, handling, security and sharing (including the appropriate deployment of anonymisation and related techniques and the creation of codebooks for their accompanying datafiles (e.g. a .txt file) so that data can be used/understood by third parties).\\n\\n### Research Data Management Policy\\n\\n### Before a project begins, a research Data Management Plan (DMP) must be completed\\n\\n1. All research proposals must include a DMP that should be kept up-to-date as the project progresses.\\n\\n2. Plans should explicitly cover: ownership; standards/methodologies for data collection and management; ethical and privacy issues (including GDPR considerations if any personal data is involved); short-term storage and long-term preservation and/or deletion; data sharing and access/ temporary or long-term restrictions.\\n\\n3. Where research is undertaken in partnership or under contract with a third party, a collaboration agreement must be signed before the start of the research that clearly addresses data ownership and partner responsibility for data storage.\\n\\nData collected during a project where the University is responsible for data storage must be stored on the University network, to ensure that it is suitably protected against accidental loss or damage and against unauthorised access\\n\\n1. The University provides a secure Research Data Storage Service (RDSS) for this purpose, which ensures that only authorised staff can access project data, and that data can be restored in the event of accidental loss or damage.\\n2. Temporary use of portable devices and storage and/or the University’s approved cloud service during, for example, field research, processing or collaboration must comply with the University’s Data Storage Policy.\\n3. Data placed on temporary storage must be transferred back onto the RDSS as soon as the requirement for temporary storage has ended, to minimise the risk of reputational damage and/or litigation caused from lost, stolen or intercepted data.\\n4. Research proposals should consider whether storage requirements may exceed those currently offered by the University.

       " \"# Research Data Management Guideline\\n\\nWith this guideline on Research Data Management (RDM), the data stewards at the Open Science Team in the University Library of Bern aim to support researchers from all faculties at the University of Bern and Insel Hospital in research data management throughout the project life cycle. This includes dealing with ethical data collection, data reuse, data generation and data processing, data documentation, and preparing data and metadata, as well as code, and software for publication.\\n\\nResearch Data of high quality is an essential resource for science and society. Research Data Management (RDM) is a part of good scientific practice according to nationally and internationally recognized standards for scientific integrity. Good RDM enhances the robustness of research outputs, facilitates research collaborations, makes research results more reproducible, and strengthens society’s trust in science.\\n\\n## 1. Planning of Research Data Management\\n\\nThe Data Management Plan (DMP) is a document and tool (Annex A, C, D), and guideline for researchers themselves to facilitate the implementation of good RDM practices in their projects throughout the whole project life cycle, including the reporting, as well as for planning the storage and safeguarding of data.\\n\\nThe DMP stipulations issued by funding agencies must be strictly adhered to. The responsibility for this lies with the grantee(s).\\n\\n## 2. Data collection and processing\\n\\nBefore data collection, data types should be identified. Sensitive (e.g., coded patient data or patient genomic data) and some non-sensitive data (e.g., animal data, plant tissues and / or seeds, soil etc.) all need authorized permissions, which must be obtained before data collection (Annex A, E).\\n\\nData volume should be roughly estimated, considering raw, re-processed and analysed data may have a different data volume, therefore, more space for data storage may be needed. This should be considered before and during data collection.\\n\\n## 3. Data documentation and metadata\\n\\nThe structure and the processing steps of all research data must be systemically documented in a digital, logical manner in order to ensure adherence to the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) principles1,2.\\n\\nThe documentation includes general information like title of dataset; contributor information; date of data collection; geographic location of data collection; keywords describing the subject of the dataset; information about funding sources that supported the collection of the data; a codebook, lab journal and special software (Annex B).\\n\\n## 4. Data storage, security and backup\\n\\nConsult group / laboratory guidelines describing where raw, reprocessed, analysed, unpublished and published data and / or the corresponding protocols, surveys, paper data and samples are stored, as well as get in touch with the IT-Department of the University of Bern to ensure storage process and location (Annex A4).\\n\\n## 5. Ethical, legal and security issues\\n\\nResearch projects conducted in Switzerland are subject to data protection law (cantonal data protection law, in some cases additionally the national data protection law) as well as special legal provisions on data protection under the Human Research Act (HRA) (Annex A2). The use of data in research projects within the scope of the HRA requires permission from the cantonal ethics commission Bern (CEC, Swissethics, Swissmedic) (Annex A8). The HRA's scope includes all methodled research on physical and mental illnesses in humans and on the structure and function of the human body, with the aim of gaining generalizable knowledge. The HRA's scope includes all methodled research on physical and mental illnesses in humans and on the structure and function of the human body, with the aim of gaining generalizable knowledge.\\n\\nUse of (coded) patient samples or data for research purposes is only permitted if written consent has been obtained (General or Informed Consent, respectively). The signed consent and a potential electronic Informed Consent (eIC) should be collected and stored separately from the coded sample/data, to avoid person identification.\\n\\nResearch projects that do not fall within the scope of the HRA do not need permission from the cantonal ethics committee but are required to get legal authorization before an experiment can be conducted (e.g., animal studies). Depending on the project and institution, special provisions may apply for obtaining authorizations (Annex A8).\\n\\nAccording to the law (see Art. 70 Bern University Act, Annex A4; Art. 60 on the Law on Personnel (Personalgesetz; Annex A5), research results and outputs obtained at the University of Bern belong to the University. If data are obtained at different Universities, then joint ownership should be applied (see Unitectra, Annex A5). For clarification of details, please contact the legal services office at UniBE (Annex A2).\\n\\n## 6. Publication of Research Data, Programming Code and Software\\n\\nTo follow the good scientific practice, research data should be published according to the principle “as open as possible, as closed as necessary”. Research data and programming code both are relevant and requested to be shared along with the publication under a “Research Data and Code Availability Statement”. They should be published and deposited in a FAIR research data repository along with rich metadata information (see section 3, Annex E4). If data cannot be openly published due to ethical or legal restrictions then a Data Transfer Agreement is recommended to upload along with the metadata and supplementary documentation material about the dataset, which will allow other researchers to understand and reuse the data (Annex A1,2 E).\\n\\n# Annexes\\n\\nThe following annexes provide additional information and available tools for research data management.\\n\\n## Annex A: Support\\n\\n### A1.

High quality data management and storage is the cornerstone of excellent research and a key aspect of responsible research conduct. The University of Bradford recognises that research data is a valuable institutional asset and should be managed in line with the UKRI’s Common Principles on Research Data.\\n\\n1.2. Most research funders, including all research councils under the auspices of UKRI, Wellcome and charity funders have data management and sharing policies, and Data Management Plans (DMPs) are now a key part of most funding applications.\\n\\n1.3. Well managed data enables research data to be securely and reliably stored long term. It enables discoverability, accessibility and reuse where appropriate, and it supports transparency and scrutiny, facilitates collaboration and encourages the ethical re-use of data to maximise the intellectual, social, cultural and economic impact of the University of Bradford’s research.\\n\\n1.4. The University supports the Concordat on Open Research Data and UKRI’s Common Principles on Research Data.\\n\\n1.5. The aim of this policy is to ensure that researchers manage their research data effectively, enabling them to:\\n\\nDemonstrate the rigour and integrity of their research.\\nEnsure that data are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable.\\nFollow university, ethical, legal and funder requirements in relation to research data and the management of research data.\\n2.1 The Policy applies to researchers: any person who conducts research, including but not limited to: an employee; a research supervisor; a visiting researcher; an independent contractor or consultant; postgraduate research students; postgraduate taught students; a visiting or emeritus member of staff; an undergraduate student; a member of staff on a joint clinical or honorary contract, and/or a public contributor to research. The Policy applies to all subject areas of the University.\\n2.2 This Policy applies to all research irrespective of how it is funded.\\n2.3 This Policy supports and complements the Code of Practice for Research, Publications and Open Access Policy, Data Protection Policy, Research Data Management IT Security Guidance, Ethics Code, Ethical Framework, Freedom of Information Policy and the Intellectual Property Policy.\\n2.4 Research and Innovation Committee owns this Policy and oversees research data management policy implementation via an oversight committee for research computing and data management.\\n2.5 The Deputy Vice Chancellor (Research, Innovation and Engagement) is responsible for ensuring that this policy is regularly reviewed and fit for purpose.\\n\\nData Management Plan: A Data Management Plan (DMP) is a formal document that outlies how date are to be managed during the lifetime of a project and after the project has been completed. It Is the basis of effective research data management.\\n\\nData Steward: A data steward is an oversight or data governance role on a research project.\\n\\nResearch: For the purposes of this policy, “research” refers to the definition used by the Research Excellence Framework 2021:\\n\\n“Research is defined as a process of investigation leading to new insights, effectively shared”.\\n\\n“It includes work of direct relevance to the needs of commerce, industry, culture, society, and to the public and voluntary sectors; scholarship; the invention and generation of ideas, images, performances, artefacts including design, where these lead to new or substantially improved insights; and the use of existing knowledge in experimental development to produce new or substantially improved materials, devices, products and processes, including design and construction. It excludes routine testing and routine analysis of materials, components and processes such as for the maintenance of national standards, as distinct from the development of new analytical techniques. It also excludes the development of teaching materials that do not embody original research.”.\\n\\n“It includes research that is published, disseminated or made publicly available in the form of assessable research outputs, and confidential reports1”.\\n\\nResearcher: The University of Bradford’s Code of Practice for Research defines researchers as: any person who conducts research, including but not limited to: an employee; a research supervisor; a visiting researcher; an independent contractor or consultant; a postgraduate research students; postgraduate taught students; a visiting or emeritus member of staff; an undergraduate student; a member of staff on a joint clinical or honorary contract, and/or a public contributor to research.\\n\\nResearch Data: is the evidence that underpins the answer to the research question and can be used to validate findings. This might be quantitative information or qualitative statements\\n\\ncollected by researchers in the course of their work by experimentation, observation, modelling, interview or other methods, or information derived from existing evidence. Research data may take the form of numbers, symbols, text, images or sounds, including computer code, annotated fieldwork observations, or a descriptive record of a physical sample.\\n\\nResearch Data Management: Research data management is an explicit process covering the creation and stewardship of research data and materials to enable their use for as long as they retain value2\\n\\nPrincipal Investigator (PI): A principal investigator is usually a member of academic staff responsible for the administration and conduct of a research project.\\n\\nPersistent Identifiers (PID): A persistent identifier is a permanent, unique reference to an object independent of storage location. The identifier ensures machine readability and that one can always find the object, even if its name or storage location changes3. Examples of PIDs include digital object identifier (DOIs) and Open Researcher and Contributor ID (ORCID).\\n\\n## 4 Responsibilities\\n\\n### 4.1 Principal Investigator\\n\\n4.1.1. Everyone at the University has a responsibility to ensure that research is undertaken in conformity with the law, in line with funders’ contractual terms and conditions, in\\n\\naccordance with best current practice and with equality, diversity and inclusion embedded.\\n\\n4.1.2. Primary responsibility for research data management lies with the Principal Investigator (sometimes referred to as Project Lead(s) or supervisor(s)) on any research project, although other project staff may be involved with research data management during and after the lifetime of the project.\\n\\n4.1.3. When University staff participate in collaborative projects, a University of Bradford lead must be identified to take responsibility for the management of data produced by the University of Bradford.\\n\\n4.1.4.

We encourage the use of persistent identifiers (where available) for datasets, for example the Digital Object Identifier (DOI), as well as ORCID for researchers.\\n5.2.7 Research data and the administrative records accompanying research projects should also be archived. Research data is a legitimate product of research and must be cited as such adhering to scholarly norms; re-used data must be explicitly traceable and original sources acknowledged.\\n5.2.8 All research projects, regardless of funding, will be accompanied by a Data Management Plan (DMP) that addresses how data will be captured, stored, accessed, secured and archived or disposed of. Each DMP must be appropriately costed into the proposal, including resources (for example, staff time, research data storage).\\n\\n5.2.9 All published outputs based on data generated by researchers should include a data access statement as standard. This is now a requirement by most funders, including UKRI.\\n\\n5.2.10 The University of Bradford will provide infrastructure and support for the safe storage of research data, as well as training for researchers at all levels that covers data security in line with current legislation, and data management planning.\\n\\n5.2.11 In most cases research data and documentation relating to the development and administration of research projects should be kept for a minimum of ten years after the end of the project. Some medical research has longer retention requirements detailed in the Document Retention and Disposal Policy.\\n\\n5.2.12 The fabrication, falsification, misrepresentation of data; plagiarism or failure to exercise due care in following out responsibilities relating to the collection and storage of data is considered to be research misconduct, and should be reported in line with the Research Misconduct Policy.\\n\\n## 6 Implementation\\n\\n6.1. The Policy will be uploaded onto HR ServiceNow so that it is available for all staff.\\n\\n6.2. The implementation of this policy is supported by the Research Data Management IT Security Guidance. Other supporting policies and guidance are listed in 9.1.\\n\\n6.3. Implementation will be supported by training for research support staff and project development staff in Research and Innovation Services, Associate Deans for Research and Innovation in the faculties. Training on Data Stewardship and Data Management Planning will be required for staff and students working on research projects.\\n\\n6.4. An oversight committee for research computing and data management will be established to support research data management and other issues relating to research computing. This committee will be responsible for ensuring delivery of the necessary training and procedures and to prioritise action required to meet University responsibilities summarised in 4.3.\\n\\n## Enforcement of this Policy and Sanctions\\n\\n7.1. The approval of the Policy will be communicated through Faculty/Directorate senior management meetings and the ub-research mailing list.\\n\\n7.2. Faculty Research and Innovation Committees are responsible for raising awareness of all new/updated policies through their normal Faculty/Directorate communication channels.\\n\\n7.3. Faculty Research and Innovation Committees and Research and Innovation Services will work with Faculties and Principal Investigators to identify appropriate provision of training, guidance and support on the implementation of this Policy.\\n\\n7.4. This policy was developed to encompass best practice as well as requirements from funders with regards to the storage and sharing of data created during research projects. Non-compliance with these requirements means that the Principal Investigator and the University of Bradford are not fulfilling the requirements of funding. This could result in the PI or University facing sanctions, such as ineligibility to make future grant applications, or suspension of funding to projects that are in progress.\\n\\n7.5. Failure to comply with funder requirements that results in sanctions against the University is classed as research misconduct and may result in disciplinary action in line with the Research Misconduct Procedure and Disciplinary Policy and Procedure.\\n\\n## 8 Monitoring and Review\\n\\nThis policy will be monitored by an oversight committee for research computing and data management which will report to Research and Innovation Committee. The committee will implement, maintain and keep under review relevant procedures and training activities.\\n\\nThe impact of this Policy shall be reviewed by Research and Innovation Committee every three years, or sooner if there are significant changes to requirements from Funders.\\n\\n## 9 Related Policies and Standards/documentation\\n\\n### 9.1 Internal Policies\\n\\nCode of Practice for Research\\nData Protection Policy\\nDocument Retention and Disposal Policy\\nEthics Code\\nEthical Framework\\nEthics Policy Governing Research Involving Human Participants, their Personal Data or Tissue, and its Conduct\\nFreedom of Information Policy\\nIntellectual Property Policy\\nResearch Data Management IT Security Guidance\\nPublications and Open Access Policy\\nResearch Misconduct Policy.\\n\\n### 9.2 External Policies\\n\\nNERC Data policy [last accessed 15/11/2021]\\nOECD Principles and Guidelines for Access to Research Data from Public Funding [last accessed\\n15/11/2021]\\nSTFC Scientific Data Policy [last accessed 15/11/2021]\\nUK Research Integrity Office – Collection and retention of data [last accessed 15/11/2021]\\nUKRI Open Access policy [last accessed 15/11/2021]\\nUKRI Guidance on best practice in the management of research data [last accessed\\n15/11/2021]\\nUUK Concordat to Support Research Integrity [last accessed 15/11/2021]\\nWellcome - Data, software and materials management and sharing policy [last accessed\\n15/11/2021]\",\n",

       " \"# University of Cambridge Research Data Management Policy Framework\\n\\nLast updated: 11th February 2021\\n\\nThe purpose of this policy framework is to provide guidance to research staff and students as to how they should manage and share the research data they produce in order to maximise the potential for research produced by the University of Cambridge in support of the University’s core values and missions. This policy framework is intended for researchers, research students and anyone who supports research at the University of Cambridge.\\n\\n## Background\\n\\n1. The University of Cambridge is committed to disseminating its research and scholarship as widely as possible. In keeping with that commitment, it supports the principle that the results of its research should be freely accessible where possible and where appropriate, and therefore supports its staff and students in making their research data available ‘as open as possible and as closed as necessary’, as articulated in the University’s Open Research Position Statement.\\n2. University staff and students are responsible for managing and curating their research data in accordance with the University Open Research Position Statement, the  policies of their research funders, the University’s Research Policies, the University’s Research Integrity and Ethics guidelines, the University’s Statement of Records Management Practice and Retention Schedule and Chapter XIII of the University’s Statutes and Ordinances on Finance and Property, subsection Intellectual Property Rights. Key aspects of these documents are incorporated into this policy framework.\\n3. This policy framework will be reviewed annually by the Open Research Steering Committee and may therefore be subject to change.\\n4. The following terms used in this policy framework can be defined as follows:\\n\\nResearch data – “the evidence that underpins the answer to the research question, and can be used to validate findings regardless of its form (e.g. print, digital, or physical). These might be quantitative information or qualitative statements collected by researchers [staff, students or those supporting research] in the course of their work by experimentation, observation, modelling, interview or other methods, or information derived from existing evidence. Data may be raw or primary (e.g. direct from measurement or collection) or derived from primary data for subsequent analysis or interpretation (e.g. cleaned up or as an extract from a larger data set), or derived from existing sources where the rights may be held by others.”[1]\\n\\nManual research records – manual research records are any non-electronic documents and materials, regardless of format, which facilitate the research activities carried out by the University. This can include both the data underpinning research as well as records relating to research quality, standards and governance; research project development and management; and research commercialization. See section 4 of the Statement of Records Management Practice and Master Records Retention Schedule for details of the specific kinds of records which fall under these categories along with their respective retention periods.\\n\\nResearch staff and students - research staff are individuals undertaking academic research either in direct employment of the University or under formal agreement with the University in another capacity (e.g. retired staff) regardless of where that research is taking place, whether in Cambridge or elsewhere; research students are individuals who are undertaking academic research at the University in pursuit of a postgraduate degree or other award.\\n\\nActive data – “Research data files that are in the process of continuous change and/or development. Files containing this data are accessed, amended and/or updated as new data is gathered and/or processed. Some datasets may never be ‘finished’. A ‘snapshot’ of active research data can be archived to create a version that is fixed and can be cited.”[2]\\n\\nData Management Plan – a plan that outlines how data will be managed from the point of collection at the start of a research project all the way through to what will happen to the data once the project finishes. Typically a data management plan (DMP) will cover areas such as collection strategy, backup and storage of data, ethical/legal requirements related to data, data sharing and data archiving.\\n\\nMetadata – information that describes significant aspects of a dataset. For example, this may include authors, title, date of publication, unique identifier, a description of what the dataset contains and licence. This provides other researchers with the information needed to understand and reuse the dataset as well as making the dataset more findable\\n\\n## Principles\\n\\n5. Reproducibility of research is a central tenet of the University and all researchers are expected to conduct their work in a rigorous manner.\\n6. The University recognises the importance of the long-term availability, with as few restrictions as possible, and long-term preservation of all research outputs including research data.\\n7. As detailed in the University’s Open Research Position Statement, the University is committed to implementing procedures that are discipline-appropriate, proportionate, evidence-based, practical, cost-effective and sustainable, and in the best interests of enhancing its mission, in order to disseminate research and scholarship as widely as possible from research publications to all forms of research data.\\n8. The University is committed to achieving compliance with the data policies of its external research sponsors, publishers and governmental agencies, and requires its research staff and students to abide by terms and conditions agreed with third parties. The University also recognises that such third parties’ policies are evolving and that they may require higher levels of data accessibility and dissemination in the future.\\n9. As detailed in the Open Research Position Statement the University recognises that “[a]cross the disciplinary spectrum there are a wide range of cultural settings that influence both capacity for and appropriateness of fully Open Research“ and it “encourages outputs of research, and where appropriate the accompanying data, to be ‘as open as possible, as closed as necessary’.”.\\n10. The University recognises that there is a balance between openness and duties under professional codes and legal obligations.\\n11. This policy framework applies to all research conducted by University staff and research students.\\n12. The University supports the Concordat on Open Data and works in line with the FAIR principles. It is working towards embedding these across the institution.\\n\\n### The University is responsible for:\\n\\n13. Disseminating information amongst its academics about the requirements under this policy framework and under policies of the University’s funders in relation to research data. Schools, Departments and Faculties are expected to be proactive in disseminating these requirements within their communities and encouraging and facilitating compliance.\\n14. Developing and supporting infrastructure and services that enable good research data management to be practised across the institution.  This includes, but is not limited to, infrastructure such as active data storage options, the University Apollo repository, the research information system, and services such as the Office of Scholarly Communication, Cambridge University Libraries, University Information Services, Research Office and Cambridge Enterprise.\\n15. Providing training and guidance to promote best practice in data management and sharing amongst its research staff and students.\\n16. Managing a website providing guidance for the University’s academics in good data management practice, including the use of electronic lab notebooks.\\n17. Providing advice and guidance on issues connected with good data management, such as data protection, research integrity, research ethics and Intellectual Property rights.\\n\\n### University Research Staff and Students are responsible for:\\n\\nPLANNING\\n\\n18. Principal Investigator(s) should establish and maintain clear research data management responsibilities within their research group to ensure good data management is practised throughout the project and by all group members. In the case of collaborative projects, the Principal Investigators must jointly agree how data is managed and maintained, sometimes across different institutions.\\n19. Preparing a Data Management Plan (whether as a research group or individual), in accordance with guidance provided by the University of Cambridge and the Digital Curation Centre (DCC). If funders require a Data Management Plan, such plan needs to be prepared according to funders’ requirements and should also be updated at project close to record how data has been managed, archived and, where appropriate, shared. This is good practice for all projects.\\n20. Ensuring that legal, ethical and commercial constraints on release of research data are considered at the initiation of the research process and throughout both the research and data life cycles.\\n21. Allocating appropriate resources (time and financial resources) for data management in their grant proposal and throughout the duration of the project and at its close.\\n22. Updating their Data Management Plans throughout the duration of their project, and to ensure that at the end of the project all their research outputs, together with their location, are indicated in their Data Management Plans. These updates are a requirement of many funders.\\n23. Depositing their final Data Management Plans into an appropriate repository (discipline-based or institutional).\\n24. In collaborative projects, agreeing on IP and data ownership matters from the outset and ensuring these are made in alignment of institutional agreements, with legal advice where appropriate.\\n\\n## ACTIVE DATA MANAGEMENT\\n\\n25. Abiding by any legal and ethical constraints pertaining to how data is stored, shared and retained.\\n26. Storing their data in an appropriate location, with at least two back-ups.\\n27. Ensuring the proper management of physical data/samples as well as digital data in line with local rules, funder and government requirements.\\n28. Ensuring that proper data citation guidelines are followed when reusing or referencing datasets.\\n29. Ensuring that wherever it is an eligible cost, appropriate funds must be fully costed onto research applications to meet all data management requirements, including the cost of archiving and sharing data.\\n\\n30. Making their research data underpinning published research findings as widely and openly available as possible, ideally by depositing research data in appropriate repositories (discipline-based or institutional). Such data should be assigned persistent Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs), such as Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) to increase its findability in accordance with the FAIR principles.\\n\\n31. Providing a statement in research articles describing how and on what terms any supporting research data may be accessed (or a statement that all data is contained within the article, if there is no supporting research data). Supporting data should be accessible online no later than the first online publication of the article.\\n\\n32. Ensuring that published research data has appropriate metadata description in accordance with guidance provided by the University of Cambridge.\\n\\n33. Ensuring that research data records are retained in appropriate repositories (discipline-based or institutional) for as long as the data are valuable to the data creator or to others, or for as long as is required by the funder or by other regulatory requirements. If data is not publicly shared, researchers should ensure it is kept safely in line with funder retention policies and to ensure the data can be produced to demonstrate research integrity if needed. Research records that do not fall under the category of research data should be handled in line with funder policies and the University Statement of Records Management Practice and Master Records Retention Schedule (Section 4). Where records are no longer required for research or funder requirements, they can be referred to the University Archives for consideration to be added to the collections, for use by other researchers in the future.\\n\\n34. When depositing research data into external data repositories, considering data repositories which support Open Researcher and Contributor ID (ORCID), funder IDs and grant IDs.\\n\\n35. Storing publicly-funded research data that is not generated in a digital format in a manner to facilitate it being shared.\\n\\n36. Upholding the University principles in rigorous, reproducible research that is persistently available by using, wherever possible, open source formats for files and file type recommended for long term preservation.\\n\\nAdvice, guidance and training to meet the expectations set out in this framework are available through the University’s Research Data Service and with the support of local Research Data Champions in faculties and departments.\\n\\n## References:\\n\\n1.

Introduction and purpose\\n\\nIn reference to institutional research policies it is useful to define what constitutes research. UCLan defines research in line with the Frascati Manual definition of research and experimental development1 and in accordance with the REF2021 definition; “research is defined as a process of investigation leading to new insights, effectively shared”\\n\\nAs an institution, UCLan fully supports open research and open practice.  Research data generated at the University is recognised as an institutional asset that when shared openly not only increases the visibility of UCLan’s research but also facilitates public engagement and creates new opportunities for knowledge exchange and collaboration.\\n\\nIn order to be made open access, research data must be created and managed with sharing in mind at every stage of the research process, from planning to publication.\\n\\nThis research data management policy clarifies the University’s expectations concerning the management, storage, publication and sharing of research data. This Policy reflects the University’s intention to establish good research data management practice throughout the research lifecycle as part of the institution’s commitment to research excellence.  The policy provides a strategic framework for the management and governance of research data generated by research activities at UCLan and aims to contribute to readiness for future Research Excellence Framework exercise or similar requirements.\\n\\n### 2. Purpose of the research data management policy\\n\\nEnsure the University and its research communities are compliant with current academic and funder requirements such as the UK Research and Innovation Common Principles on Data Policy, the Wellcome Trust Policy on Data\\nManagement and Sharing, Horizon 2020 Guidelines on Open Access to Scientific Publications and Data and the Concordat on Open Research Data.\\nBy requiring deposit of key datasets, to ensure the widest possible audience for research data assets produced at UCLan in order to facilitate discovery, citation, sharing and collaboration and thereby to increase impact\\nClarify responsibilities so that researchers understand exactly what is required of them\\nContribute towards a culture of openness and transparency\\n\\n## University of Central Lancashire UCLan\\n\\nEstablish data deposit as an integral part of the open access process\\nEnsure the concept of data sharing is built into the research process from planning\\nto publishing\\nEnsure key datasets are preserved and accessible for as long as required by funder,\\nethics committee or the University\\nSet out the University’s obligations including the provision of facilities for the\\narchiving of research data, training, support and guidance on good practice in\\nresearch data management\\nDraw attention to existing relevant documentation that underpins and clarifies\\nelements of the policy with particular regard to obligations of a legal, ethical,\\nregulatory and contractual nature\\n\\n### 3. Scope of policy\\n\\nAll academics at UCLan who produce or work with data generated as a result of research, regardless of how that research is funded;\\nAll academics who supervise or co-supervise postgraduate research students; All postgraduate research students.\\n\\n### 4. Policy Awareness\\n\\nAll researchers should familiarise themselves with relevant UCLan policies, in particular this Research Data Management Policy, the Open Access Policy2, the Policies on Intellectual Property for staff and students3, the Data Protection Policy4 and UCLan’s Ethical Principles for Teaching, Research, Consultancy, Knowledge Transfer and Related Activities5.\\n\\nExternally-funded researchers must ensure compliance with their funder’s policy on research data management and data publication.  In cases where researchers may be affected by a number of policies, funder policy should take precedence.\\n\\n### 5. Data Management Planning\\n\\nAll researchers should develop a data management plan (DMP) at the outset of their research project, regardless of whether it is funded or not funded.  The DMP should form the basis of data management throughout the various stages of the research lifecycle.\\n\\n## University of Central Lancashire UCLan\\n\\nGrants and Funding Unit (GFU) will advise whether a research funder requires a DMP to be included in the grant application.\\n\\nDMPs should address the creation, management, storage and sharing of research data and the production of descriptive metadata to aid discovery and re-use.  Researchers should use the UCLan, funder or generic DPM templates available in the Digital Curation Centre’s DMPonline6.\\n\\nWhere a DMP is a requirement of funding or grant application/s, researchers must work with the Research Data Management Officer and GFU to ensure they are following good practice in research data management and to develop DMPs of a consistently high standard.\\n\\nResearch data must be stored appropriately and securely throughout the life of the research project in accordance with guidance from LIS. See;  IT Security policy and Sharing documents and Data policy\\n\\nResearchers likely to generate very large datasets exceeding storage provided as standard by the institution7 must work with the Research Data Management Officer and Learning and Information Services (LIS) to identify a satisfactory storage solution.\\n\\nResearchers should ensure that the costs of research data management and any additional data storage required are included in grant applications to external funders, where permitted.\\n\\nUnfunded researchers must be able to cover the cost of excessive data requirements (beyond standard availability) through Faculty or School budgets, and this must be agreed before commencement of research.\\n\\n### 6. Roles and Responsibilities\\n\\n#### 6.1 The University\\n\\nThe University is responsible for the provision of a managed repository service for secure archiving, preservation and long-term storage of completed digital research data and open access research publications, including journal articles and conference papers.  The University provides training, support and advice on all aspects of research data management.\\n\\n#### 6.2 Researchers\\n\\nOverall responsibility for research data management during any research project lies with the most senior UCLan researcher (the Data Steward for the project).  In cases where the project is led by an external partner there is still a requirement for data generated or shared by UCLan to be managed by a named individual at UCLan.\\n\\n## University of Central Lancashire UCLan\\n\\nThe Data Steward of any externally-funded project should meet with the Research Data Management Officer at regular intervals during the project lifetime, to be agreed at the post-award meeting.\\n\\nLead UCLan authors of published research are responsible for ensuring compliance with funder and University policy regarding open access to research papers and the underlying data.  Published papers must acknowledge funders, where applicable, and include a short statement describing how and on what terms any supporting research datasets may be accessed.\\n\\n#### 6.2.1 Doctoral Supervisors\\n\\nWhere a researcher supervises doctoral students he/she should be aware of supervisor responsibilities with regard to ensuring retention of key PGR datasets. They should follow the guidelines within the UCLan Code of Practice Relating to the Supervision, Examination and Administration of Research Degrees  and the Graduate School guiding principles for Research Supervisors,8 specifically; •To assist PGRs with identifying any IP rights arising in or from their work and keeping this under regular review throughout the programme of study; •To ensure the appropriate storage or deletion of PGR student data following completion of studies; •To ensure that upon completion of studies PGRs remove and dispose of all data, equipment, materials and personal belongings appropriately and in a timely fashion; •To arrange appropriate storage and/or archiving of PGR student data upon completion of studies; •To advise PGRs of the requirement to ensure their thesis, plus relevant data is deposited into the institutional repository\\n\\n#### 6.2.2 Postgraduate Research Students\\n\\nPrimary responsibility for the management of data produced during research activities lies with the student, overseen by the Director of Studies/Supervisory Team\\n\\n#### 6.3 Intellectual Property Rights\\n\\nOwnership of intellectual property (IP) created by UCLan staff is outlined in the University Policy on Intellectual Property (Section 3). IP which has potential exploitation (commercial and non-commercial)  or publicity value or could otherwise enhance the reputation of UCLan should be identified and disclosed to the University at the earliest opportunity.  The associated data may need to be withheld for a limited period of time (see point 6) to protect IP that would otherwise be compromised.\\n\\n## University of Central Lancashire UCLan\\n\\n#### 6.4. External Collaborations and Contracts\\n\\nWhere a project involves external collaborators, the lead organisation is responsible for putting appropriate formal agreements in place covering the contributions and rights of the various organisations and individuals involved.  All such agreements should be reviewed and approved by the University before the project begins.\\n\\nExcept where this is a condition of funding, exclusive rights to research data must not be handed, sold or licensed to external parties.\\n\\n### 7. Data Sharing and Preservation\\n\\nAll researchers should familiarise themselves with and comply with GDPR and DPA regulations on data sharing.\\n\\nData that has been selected for retention should not be deposited with any organisation that does not commit to its access and availability for reuse unless this is a condition of funding or would prevent commercial interests.\\n\\nAll digital research data that has been selected by the Data Steward or research group for retention should be deposited in the UCLan data repository or a suitable national or international data service or subject repository within 12 months of generation.  As a minimum, where a dataset underpins published research, every effort must be made to ensure its availability on open access at the date of publication or before.\\n\\nResearch data that has been selected for retention should be registered with UCLan’s data repository, even where the data has been deposited in an external repository or if the data is not suitable for open access.  Datasets can be registered by creating a metadata-only record which must contain a stable link, preferably a digital object identifier (DOI) to the externally-held data, where applicable.\\n\\nFunders typically regard non-deposit of research data as an exception therefore researchers should make every effort throughout the project to ensure data can be shared openly.  Legitimate reasons for non-deposit of data include ethical, legal and commercial constraints; where feasible, issues preventing data sharing should be identified prior to data generation.\\n\\nThe funder should always be made aware of any constraints on access and researchers must be prepared to provide evidence justifying non-deposit.  Where the risk has a limited time span, researchers should ensure a publication plan is in place.  Data that is withheld or temporarily embargoed should still be managed and held in a format that would permit sharing in event of, for example, a Freedom of Information request or random audit by a funder.\\n\\nIf the research data are to be deleted or destroyed, for example because its agreed period of retention has expired or due to ethical or legal reasons, this should be done so in accordance with all legal, ethical, research funder and collaborator requirements, and with particular concern for confidentiality and security. Any action taken should be documented and retrievable, for possible future audit.\\n\\n### 8. Sensitive Data\\n\\nThe University’s  Ethical Principles for Teaching, Research, Consultancy, Knowledge Transfer and Related Activities provides guidance on approaches to handling sensitive data.  Where research involves the collection of personal data, researchers should work within the guidelines set out in UCLan’s Data Protection Policy\\n\\n#### 8.1 Security-sensitive Data\\n\\nSecurity-sensitive research material relates to any data - digital or analogue - that can be interpreted as contravening counter-terrorism legislation under the Terrorism Act (2006)9. This Act outlaws the dissemination of records, statements and other documents that can be interpreted as promoting or endorsing terrorist acts or extremism; making explosives/radioactive devices that have a military (or hazardous) purpose and trespass on nuclear sites; and IT encryption design that could pose as a threat to national security.\\n\\nAny such data must be stored and managed off the University network and according to guidelines set out in the Universities UK document ‘Oversight of security-sensitive research material in UK universities’10.  Researchers and research students working with or generating security-sensitive data must liaise with the Research Data Management Officer to ensure compliance with Government regulations.\\n\\n### 9. Policy Review\\n\\nThe University Research and Innovation Committee will be responsible for approving this policy as recommended by the Open Research Steering Group.  The policy will be reviewed at least annually by the Open Research Steering Group and updated as deemed necessary.\\n\\nNext Review date January 2022',\n",
       " '# Policy for Research Data Management\\n\\n## 1. Preface\\n\\n### 1.1 Introduction\\n\\nResearch data management is a collective term for the planning, collection, storage, sharing and preservation of research data, and it therefore covers the entire research data lifecycle (Figure 1). Good management of research data contributes to improved efficiency and transparency of research processes, and to increased reliability and reproducibility of research results. Thorough planning can ensure compliance with legislation, promote a clear division of responsibilities between collaborators, and safeguard secure storage and handling of data to prevent loss or misuse. For the individual researcher, good data management can lead to improved visibility and impact of their research, for example by facilitating the reuse of their data sets by others.\\n\\n\\nFigure 1. An illustration of a research data lifecycle\\n\\n### 1.2 Purpose\\n\\nThe policy’s objective is to outline requirements for the management of research data, and enable researchers and students to follow good scientific practice within their discipline, while adhering to laws covering research data management. The University of Copenhagen (UCPH) is committed to the highest standards of excellence in research and will support the competences necessary to adhere to this policy through training, support, advice, guidelines, tools and templates for research data management, where appropriate.\\n\\n### 1.3 Scope\\n\\n1.3.1 This policy is relevant to anyone conducting or supporting research activities at the University of Copenhagen. Among others, this includes scientific staff, PhD students, visiting and affiliate researchers, collectively referred to as researchers. It includes research support staff, such as laboratory technicians and data managers, when they manage research data as part of research projects at UCPH. Lastly, it includes students in the following situations: 1) when they carry out their own research projects as part of their Bachelor’s or Master’s degree programmes and 2) when they contribute to research projects at UCPH, for example in the role of project member or employed student assistant.\\n\\n1.3.2 The policy covers physical material and digital data collected, observed, generated, created or reused as part of research activities conducted at UCPH, collectively referred to as research data in this policy unless specifically stated otherwise. This includes any physical material and digital data that form the basis of the research, such as specimens, notebooks, interviews, texts and literature, digital raw data, recordings and computer code, as well as the detailed records of these materials and data that comprise the basis for the analysis underlying the results.\\n\\nThis policy applies to all research data collected, observed, generated, created or reused after 11 January 2022 (the publication date of this policy). It does not cover data collected and used solely for teaching activities1.\\n\\n1.3.3 The policy adheres to the relevant legislation and follows the Danish Code of Conduct for Research Integrity, the UCPH Code of Conduct for Responsible Research as well as other university policies, such as the Information Security Policy and the Policy on Research Planning and Conduct.\\n\\n1.3.4 In relation to the specific research area and the individual research project, it must be assessed whether and to what extent the data management policy, or parts of the policy, are relevant.\\n\\n### 1.4 Faculty implementation\\n\\nThe faculties (deans) are responsible for the implementation of this policy at the faculties. Deans must ensure that a plan and a timeline for the implementation of this policy are developed at their faculty (also see 3.5). Where necessary, faculties, departments, research groups, PhD schools, etc. may introduce more specific requirements, procedures and guidelines for the implementation of the policy according to local practice.\\n\\n## 2. Principles\\n\\n### 2.1 Data management plans\\n\\n2.1.1 The management of research data must be thoroughly considered before physical materials and digital data are collected, observed, generated, created or reused. Data management plans (DMP) must be developed and documented, preferably in electronic format. As a minimum, the topics addressed in this policy (clauses 2.2-2.7) must be reviewed, for example by using the DMP template provided at UCPH. DMPs should be updated when significant changes to the management of research data occur and (references to) the DMP should be stored with the corresponding research data as long as they exist.\\n\\n2.1.2 The DMP should be discussed with project collaborators, research managers and supervisors (if any), ensuring that agreements are reached regarding responsibilities for different research data management activities during and after research projects.\\n\\n### 2.2 Rights to research data\\n\\n2.2.1 Rights to research data must be clarified at the start of research projects. Unless legislation states otherwise, or agreements have been made to determine otherwise, the following is the default at UCPH:\\n\\na. In accordance with the general rules of copyright during employment, researchers hold the copyright to books and articles they publish as a result of research projects carried out at UCPH.\\nb. UCPH holds the copyright to software created by employees during the performance of their work.\\nc. UCPH holds the rights to research data in the shape of physical objects collected by researchers during their employment at UCPH, such as biological and geological samples, notebooks, paper interviews and books. These objects may not be removed without permission.\\nd. A copy of digital data sets and associated metadata must remain at UCPH when employment ceases. As a minimum, this applies to data sets underlying publications.\\ne. In accordance with the Danish Act on Inventions at Public Research Institutions, UCPH has the right to acquire researchers’ inventions and to ask researchers to postpone publication of such inventions for a short time period.\\n\\nIn addition, the following should be clarified:\\n\\nf. To what extent research data can be accessed in the project. For example, in projects involving personal data, it must be clarified to what extent rules of data confidentiality impose limits on data access, and how these limits will be upheld.\\ng. Who can access and manage the research data, and within which timeframe.\\nh. When and to what extent research data may be used for other purposes, for example in other research projects. It should be determined what rules apply if a project member leaves the project and/or UCPH.\\ni. Whether research data can be shared after project end, and if so, what the terms of data reuse by others will be.\\nj. Intellectual property rights, including whether the research project makes use of material that interferes with the rights of others, and how the necessary approvals should be obtained to clear these rights.\\nk. The legislation, policies or agreements governing the above, including whether there are special loyalty or confidentiality obligations.\\nl. Any research data management requirements by research funders, partner organisations, etc.\\n\\n2.2.2 The University’s Tech Transfer Office must be involved as early as possible in the negotiation of all third-party contracts containing provisions on intellectual property rights, such as non-disclosure agreements, material transfer agreements and collaboration agreements. Patentable inventions must be reported to the Tech Transfer Office in accordance with the Act on Inventions at Public Research Institutions.\\n\\n### 2.3 Ethical and legal approvals\\n\\n2.3.1 It should be ensured that the appropriate ethical and legal approvals are obtained before the start of a project, and (references to) the approvals should be stored along with the research data, as long as they exist.\\n\\n2.3.2 Strict legal and local requirements exist for projects involving personal data.\\n\\nAmong others, projects in which personal data are being processed (including biobanks) must be registered at UCPH, and approvals to process personal data must as a minimum be filed in the University’s archiving system. Conditions for transfer of personal data and material between UCPH and external collaborators or a third party must be captured into agreements.\\n\\n### 2.4 Collection, processing and documentation\\n\\n2.4.1 Research data should be collected and processed in line with best practice in the research discipline. Research projects should be documented in a way that allows them to be repeated by others. Among other things, this includes clearly and accurately describing project methodology and any equipment, software or code used.\\n\\n2.4.2 Research data should be described using appropriate metadata to facilitate searching for, the identification of, and the interpretation of the research data. Metadata should be linked to the research data as long as they exist, unless legislation or agreements state otherwise.\\n\\n### 2.5 Storage and security\\n\\n2.5.1 Research data must be classified at the start of a research project on the basis of the level of sensitivity and the impact to the University if data are disclosed, altered or destroyed without authorisation. Risks to data security and of data loss should be assessed in relation to the data classification. This includes evaluating:\\n\\na. Physical and digital access to research data\\nb. Risks associated with data management procedures\\nc. Backup requirements and backup procedures\\nd. External and internal threats to data confidentiality, integrity and accessibility\\ne. Financial, regulatory and technical consequences of working with data, data storage and data preservation.\\n\\n2.5.2 Risks to data subjects’ rights and freedom must be assessed in projects involving personal data and a risk assessment must be conducted and recorded when registering projects at UCPH. In some cases with a high risk for the data subjects, a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) must also be carried out as part of the registration process.\\n\\n2.5.3 Infrastructure for storing and processing research data, and for collaborating in research projects, must be chosen in accordance with the identified risks, and in compliance with UCPH’s Information Security Policy and the legal requirements for processing personal data.\\n\\n### 2.6 Data sharing\\n\\n2.6.1 Legislation or agreements may preclude research data sharing or impose conditions for sharing. Before sharing research data, the relevant approvals need to be obtained and, if necessary, the appropriate agreements set up to allow data and material sharing.\\n\\n2.6.2 By default, research data should be made openly available after project end, as a minimum for data sets underlying research publications. Concerns relating to intellectual property rights, personal data protection, information security as well as commercial and national interests and legislation must be taken into account in accordance with the principle of ‘as open as possible, as closed as necessary’.  If the research data cannot be made available, sharing the metadata associated with the research data should be considered.\\n\\n2.6.3 The FAIR principles (for findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable research objects) should be followed as much as possible when preparing digital data sets that can be shared. This includes as a minimum:\\n\\na. Providing open access to data (Open Data) by depositing data in a data repository, or by providing access to information on whether, when, how, and to what extent data can be accessed if data sets cannot be made openly available.\\nb. As much as possible using persistent identifiers (PID) and metadata (such as descriptive keywords) that help locate the data set.\\nc. Communicating terms and conditions for data reuse by others, for example by attaching a data licence.\\nd. Providing the information necessary to understand how data sets were created and structured, and for what purpose.\\nThe level of compliance with the FAIR principles, in addition to the minimum requirements\\ndescribed above, is defined by the individual research discipline in relation to international\\nnorms and standards in that discipline.\\n\\n### 2.7 Long term preservation\\n\\n2.7.1 Appropriate arrangements for the long-term preservation of digital data, physical material and associated metadata must be made, adhering to legislation and/or agreements. This should include:\\n\\na. Deciding which research data will be preserved. As a minimum, data sets underlying published research results must be preserved so that any objections or criticisms can be addressed.\\nb. Deciding how long research data will be preserved. Data sets underlying research publications should be retained for at least five years after project completion or date of publication, whichever comes last.\\nc. Choosing a format and location in which research data should be preserved, and deciding what metadata should be associated with the preserved data and material.\\nd. Deleting/destructing research data if legislation or agreements exclude preservation, or when researchers and their managers determine that preservation is not required (for example when research data can easily be reproduced) or not possible (for example when research data are too costly to store or when material quality will deteriorate over time).\\ne. Assigning a person, persons or role(s) responsible for the research data after project end. Responsibilities include safeguarding the long-term integrity of data sets.\\nf. Determining rights, for example, of access to and use of preserved data sets.\\n\\n2.7.2 A copy of data sets and associated metadata must remain at UCPH after project end and/or when employment with the University ceases, in a way in which they are accessible to research managers and understandable for research managers and peers, unless legislation or agreements determine otherwise. As a minimum, this applies to data sets underlying publications. Responsibilities for and rights to these data sets must be agreed upon.\\n\\n2.7.3 Digital research data sets must be registered at project end if the research falls within the scope of the Executive Order on the Registration of Digital Research Data created by State Authorities, so that the Danish National Archives can assess the data sets’ potential for longterm preservation. The National Archives may subsequently request a copy of the data to be transferred to the archives. Data in these projects can only be destructed if the National Archives issue a disposal provision after their assessment.\\n\\n2.7.4 Personal data can only be preserved\\na. if anonymised\\nb. at the Danish National Archives\\nc. when there is a legal basis for the long term preservation of personal data in a secure database, biobank or other collection for research purposes.\\n\\n2.7.5 A plan for research data preservation and/or destruction must be developed, in alignment with legislation, (local) guidelines and agreements (if any), and the continued need for preservation should be reviewed on a regular basis.\\n\\n## 3.

Further assistance with application of policy .. 5 Appendix 1: Formal Policy Guidance Notes for the Management of Research Data. 6 Appendix 2: Formal Policy Guidance Notes for the Management of Undergraduate Research Data 10 Document Information . 14\\n\\n# Overview\\n\\nThe purpose of this policy is to establish a set of principles to govern the management of data arising from the research activities of the University (“Research Data”1). This policy is intended to cover active Research Data sets that are of potential current or future interest or value to the field. It will not apply where there are legitimate legal, ethical and/or commercial constraints on data use.\\n\\nThe University recognises that there is an increased requirement from funders to manage, share and provide open access to Research Data, and acknowledges that the wider benefits of this approach can include additional public interest and funding, increased validation of results, efficiencies through data re- use and novel use of existing data.\\n\\nFor clarity, this policy applies to all Research Data, regardless of whether the research is externally funded or subject to funder mandates. This policy applies to all staff that are authorized to use the University’s name and services in the course of their research, including post graduate students and visiting, honorary and emeritus staff. NHS and clinical trial data may be subject to additional governance as specified by the Director of R&D, Tayside Medical Sciences Centre (TASC), NHS Tayside.\\n\\n## 1. Policy Statement Principles\\n\\n1.1. The University advocates the highest standards in the management, re-use and open accessibility of Research Data and subscribes to the Research Councils Common Principles on Data Policy and the Concordat on Open Research Data.\\n\\n1.2. The privacy, confidentiality and other legitimate interests of any participants involved in the gathering of Research Data must remain protected at all times.\\n\\n1.3. Where appropriate, and adhering to item 1.2, Research Data should be made openly accessible for access and re-use by others.\\n\\n1.4. Research Data sets that are of a sensitive nature2 are not exempt from this policy by default, but may lie outwith this policy where restrictions on data use apply. Prior to commencing research, informed consent (including consent for data sharing) should be gathered, and plans for data anonymisation and access restriction should be made.\\n\\n1.5. Research that is commercially funded, including clinical research sponsored3 by the University of Dundee, will lie outwith this policy only if restrictions on data use apply. Where research is jointly funded by commercial and non-commercial funders, appropriate collaboration agreements must be put in place to define ownership of the Research Data and ensure compliance with the data sharing requirements of the noncommercial funder(s).\\n\\n1.6. The primary grant holder (Principal Investigator) is responsible for Research Data management and planning throughout their research project or programme. The most senior researcher associated with a project at the University of Dundee holds responsibility for the data stewardship for all Research Data relating to that project. In the absence of the senior researcher, responsibility for the data stewardship will transfer upward to the Dean of School.\\n\\n1.7. New research projects must include research data management plans that cover items such as: data capture, management, integrity, confidentiality, retention, sharing and publication. Any specific funding body, ethical, legal or School level requirements should be taken into account in the development of data management plans.\\n\\n1.8. Where there is a need to establish proprietary rights to protect the intellectual property of the University, Principal Investigators should discuss the intention to place Research Data in the public domain with Research & Innovation Services (RIS) before doing so. Every effort should be made to ensure that the timeframe to establish such rights is kept to a minimum.\\n\\n1.9. All research data gathered by students during the course of their study are the responsibility of the supervising staff member to manage in accordance with the requirements of this policy.\\n\\n1.10. The Library & Learning Centre (LLC) will provide support, guidance and information on appropriate research data management activities, including planning for funding applications, availability of internal and external research data repositories, licensing of datasets and allocation of persistent identifiers for datasets.\\n\\n## 2. Storage and Accessibility\\n\\n2.1. All Research Data of potential current or future interest, or that which substantiates published research findings, should be assessed by the Principal Investigator for deposition in an appropriate external or University led research data repository.\\n\\n2.2. The associated costs of data management, analytics, archiving and sharing should be recovered from funders in the grant application, where funder’s policies permit.\\n\\n2.3. Data must be stored securely, with appropriate measures taken to minimize the risk of unauthorised access, loss, destruction or theft.\\n\\n2.4. Where personal data sets are being used in research they shall be used in a manner compliant with the applicable data protection legislation4, or any statutory modification or re-enactment thereof. In particular:\\n\\nOnly the absolute minimum of personal data necessary shall be processed for any project\\nThe basis for lawful use of personal data shall be documented\\nEvery research participant shall be given information on the project and the use of each individual participant’s information shall meet transparency\\nrequirements.\\n\\n2.5. A central record of known datasets deposited in public access repositories, or curated by Schools, will be maintained by the LLC. Any Research Data to be deposited with external services, such as Research Council or international repositories, should therefore be made known to the LLC for recording in the University’s research information system (discovery@dundee.ac.uk). The University will ensure data continues to be discoverable and compliant with funder mandates.\\n\\n2.6. Published research results should always include information on how to access supporting data. The LLC will provide a persistent and unique identifier for datasets (DOI) where required.\\n\\n2.7. The University of Dundee will respect the requirements and policies of existing and future partnerships with third parties involved in the storage and safeguarding of Research Data. NHS and clinical trial data may be subject to additional governance as specified by the R&D Director, TASC, NHS Tayside (see TASC Publication Policy).\\n\\n2.8. The length of time data is stored for should be determined as part of the Research Data management planning for the project, and should adhere to any particular funding body’s requirements and any additional conditions or practices within the field. The Concordat on Open Data states “data underlying publications should be retained for 10 years from the date of any publication which fundamentally relies on the data, unless specified otherwise by the funder of the research.”\\n\\n2.9. Data are to be made openly available as soon as possible, and typically on publication of results. Embargo periods are permitted, but should adhere to any particular funding\\n\\nbody’s requirements and any additional conditions or practices within the field. It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator to adhere to funder requirements for data publishing and, where necessary, to negotiate an extension to restrictions on placing data in the public domain.\\n\\n2.10. Where data are published, the Principal Investigator is required to select an appropriate license under which their data will be made available and to ensure that the license permits sharing and re-use in accordance with their funder’s mandate and the terms and conditions of this policy. Guidance is available from University support services (see item 1.10 above). Electronic data published by the University Repository will be catalogued using structured metadata which includes details of licensing and a robust persistent digital object identifier (DOI).\\n\\n2.11. The University of Dundee retains the rights to re-use Research Data or make it openly available for others to re-use. Exclusive rights to re-use or publish Research Data should not therefore be granted to any third party, including commercial publishers, without prior discussion with RIS (paragraph 1.8 refers).\\n\\n2.12. The University of Dundee retains the intellectual property rights of the Research Data. Principal Investigators are entitled to be the first publishers of the data they have generated and have the right to be identified and credited as the creator. Original copies of data must be retained. Duplicate copies of data may be taken with permission of the PI or Dean where the re-use of the data are acceptable, as defined by this policy.\\n\\n2.13. All clinical trials sponsored by the University of Dundee must be registered on an appropriate publicly accessible research register within 6 weeks of first participant recruitment in the UK. Summary results data from clinical trials must be made publicly accessible in an appropriate format within 12 months from trial completion (for further details see the TASC Publication Policy).\\n\\n## 3. Further assistance with application of policy\\n\\nGuidance on the central record of Research Data sets, open access, appropriate internal and external research data repositories, and research data management planning is available from the Assistant Director, Research & Resources, LLC (h.whaley@dundee.ac.uk). Guidance on IPR and collaboration agreements is available from RIS (research@dundee.ac.uk). Guidance on clinical or health data is available from TASC (tasctayside@nhs.net) and HIC (hicsupport@dundee.ac.uk).\\n\\nIf there is uncertainty around the applicability or interpretation of this policy, the matter must be referred to the Convener of the University’s Research Governance & Policy Sub-Committee (contact the Assistant Director (Research & Resources), LLC, in the first instance: h.whaley@dundee.ac.uk). Also see Appendix one, Formal Policy Guidance Notes for the Management of Research Data and Appendix two, Formal Policy Guidance Notes for the Management of Undergraduate Research Data that follow this document.\\n\\n# Appendix 1: Formal Policy Guidance Notes for the Management of Research Data\\n\\n## 1. Scope\\n\\nThis document clarifies policy requirements outlined in the University of Dundee Policy to Govern the Management of Research Data (hereafter PGMRD). It is a set of procedures for the practical management of research data.\\n\\n## 2. Responsibilities\\n\\nThe Principal Investigator (PI) has responsibility to budget for the costs associated with the storage, maintenance and preservation of research data and to maintain a record of activity in the Data Management Plan (PGMRD 1.7 and 2.2); in addition to create a record in the data catalogue housed in the Institutional Repository, Discovery (PGMRD 2.5). The Library & Learning Centre (LLC) provide support for data management planning activities.\\n\\nThe PI has overall responsibility for the appraisal and archiving of data following the completion of a project – or at an appropriate stage of an ongoing long term project. (PGMRD 2.1). The appraisal process should be rigorous, accountable and transparent with decisions recorded in the Data Management Plan. In addition the data catalogue record in Discovery should document the anticipated date of destruction for the data where appropriate.\\n\\n## 3. Storage\\n\\nDuring the life of a research project, research records should be stored and indexed so that they can be identified and retrieved quickly and easily in line with good research practice. The PI can select storage from one of the following approved University storage facilities.\\n\\n### Approved University storage facilities\\n\\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Network drive'S' (Shared)</td><td>UoDMicrosoftOneDrive SharePoint</td><td>Life Sciences Secure Storage</td><td>Health Informatics Centre</td></tr><tr><td>On-Site Storage</td><td>Cloud storage</td><td>On-SiteStorage</td><td>On-Site Storage</td></tr><tr><td>Tape Backup</td><td>Back up on multiple data centres</td><td>Tape Backup</td><td>TapeBackup</td></tr><tr><td>No external access</td><td>Offsite Accessibility for external collaborators</td><td>No external access</td><td>Controlled offsite accessibilityforexternal collaborators</td></tr><tr><td>Unlimited storage</td><td>5 TB storage limit, more storage available on requestfrom UoDIT</td><td>To be agreed with Life SciencesIT.All staffand postgraduate students start project requirements with 5GB of personal</td><td>To be agreed with HIC and costed as part of</td></tr><tr><td>Suitablefornon-shared data</td><td>Suitable for non-shared data</td><td>networkstorage Suitable for non-shared data</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Suitable for sharingwith defined internal group</td><td>Suitable for sharing with defined internal and external group</td><td>Suitableforsharingwith defined internal group</td><td>Suitable for sharing with defined group</td></tr><tr><td>Immediate availability</td><td>Immediate availability</td><td>ContactLifeSciences IT</td><td>Contact HIC</td></tr></table></body></html>\\n\\n## 4. Procedures\\n\\n### 4.1. File Naming\\n\\nElectronic records should be organised for optimised accessibility and record keeping. Files should contain the following descriptive metadata within the filename:\\n\\nResearcherSurname_Initial Project (name or grant number) Instrument Location Date Time Version At a minimum the file name should observe the following format, using fields as appropriate; ResearcherSurname_Initial_project_instrument_location_date_time_version.ext5\\n\\n### 4.2. Backing up data\\n\\nElectronic data held on laptops, PCs, instruments and within electronic lab books should be backed up onto approved University storage daily to prevent loss of records through accidental or intentional damage or destruction (PGMRD 2.3). The file naming convention described previously must be applied to all files.\\n\\nFor all confidential research data hosted outside University networks – on University licensed systems such as Microsoft Stream, OneDrive, SharePoint - electronic records should be protected with passwords and encrypted as outlined in UoD IT security and storage guidance. Further information is available at UoDIT guides.\\n\\n### 4.3. Archiving data\\n\\nThe requirement to archive data is triggered when research records become (relatively) inactive after the completion of a project, or phase of a project, or when a PI or PhD student leaves the University. At this stage the PI should arrange transfer to approved University storage facilities for longer term storage. It is essential that data are well described in order that they are easily identifiable and retrievable (PGMRD 2.1, 2.3). Data should be converted to open file formats where possible.\\n\\n#### 4.3.1. Appraisal of data\\n\\nData must be appraised in accordance with the Data Management Plan. The PI determines what data is to be retained and where it is to be stored – either publically in an external subject specific repository or the University institutional repository, Discovery or internally on University approved storage. All files must be named according to the conventions described in section 4.1 of this document and a descriptive title for the dataset created.\\n\\nResearch data should be preserved for as long as it is of continuing value to the researcher, the wider research team/community and in line with known legal and regulatory obligations. As stated in the PGMRD 2.7, research sponsors may specify requirements for retention of specific categories of records.\\n\\nFor an overview of funders policies see   Clarification of funder policy and support with compliance is provided by LLC Research Services, contact discovery@dundee.ac.uk.\\n\\nThe University of Dundee retention policy for research data is outlined in the Policy to Govern the Management of Research Data. Staff/students are permitted to take a copy of their research data where data are not sensitive and where permission has been obtained from\\n\\nthe PI.6 (PGMRD 2.12)\\n\\n#### 4.3.2. Data that is to be destroyed\\n\\nResearch data should be destroyed when judged to be of no further value or when retention periods described in the Data Management Plan expire. Destruction should be authorised by staff with appropriate authority, such as the PI or their designated administrator and should be carried out in accordance with the University’s Guidance on the proper disposal of information.\\n\\nPIs who are leaving the institution and are transferring an ongoing project must notify the LLC and provide authorisation for destruction of the data at Dundee following completion of the transfer.\\n\\n#### 4.3.3. Data catalogue – creating a record\\n\\nAt the point of archiving a record must be created in Discovery (instructions on creating a data record in Discovery) and the data given a descriptive title (PGRMD 2.5). Persistent identifiers (e.g. a digital object identifier - DOI) assigned to published data should be recorded in the data catalogue entry in Discovery. This record can either be made visible in the Discovery portal or set to confidential.\\n\\nData made publically available from Discovery or the Image Data Repository, Omero, will have been assigned a DOI by the University. If a DOI is required contact discovery@dundee.ac.uk.\\n\\nThe minimum metadata collected in the Discovery data catalogue record are Title, Creator, Publisher, Year, Resource Type and Rights (i.e. licencing restrictions on data reuse). Additional recommended elements include ORCiD, Description, Time period, Geo location, Associated publications, Associated datasets.\\n\\nFor a DOI to be minted the minimum metadata required are Title, Creator, Publisher, Year, DOI and Resource type (e. g. image data) – additional metadata such as File type and size, Subject, Version, Rights, ORCiD, PMID, Funder, Associated publications, can also be captured. Further detail and guidance on the metadata that can be captured when registering a DOI can be found at this link.\\n\\n## 5. Definitions\\n\\nResearch data are the evidence that underpins the answer to the research question, and can be used to validate findings regardless of its form (e.g. print, digital, or physical). These might be quantitative information or qualitative statements collected by researchers in the course of their work by experimentation, observation, modelling, interview or other methods, or information derived from existing evidence. As defined by RCUK Concordat on Open Research Data. Research and experimental development (R&D) comprise creative work undertaken on a systematic basis in order to increase the stock of knowledge, including knowledge of man, culture and society, and the use of this stock of knowledge to devise new applications. As defined in The Frascati Manual definition ofresearch.\\n\\n## 6.

Scope\\n\\nThis document clarifies policy requirements outlined in the University of Dundee Policy to Govern the Management of Research Data (hereafter PGMRD). It is a set of procedures for the practical management of undergraduate research data.\\n\\n## 2. Responsibilities\\n\\ni. In accordance with the PGMRD (1.9) the supervising staff member is responsible for student research data, this includes responsibility for the integrity and security of all research data produced during a research project by students.\\nii. Where the supervisor delegates administrative activity for managing research data to other members of academic or administrative staff, s/he should define and document these arrangements within the School.\\niii. During a research project, research data should be stored and indexed so that they can be identified and retrieved quickly and easily by supervisory (and if necessary) technical and administrative staff – this is for the purposes of research integrity, access continuity, to reduce the risk of data loss and to ensure the security of confidential data.\\n\\niv. Schools should maintain a record of:\\n\\nthe file name, format and location of research data; research data which have been transferred to another organisation (e.g. deposited in a third-party data archive); research data which have been published by the University for reuse by third parties; (See PGMRD 2.5 for guidance)\\nthe destruction of research data, including the authority for destruction and the date of destruction.\\n\\n## 3.

Procedures\\n\\n### 4.1. Storage of Sensitive or Confidential data\\n\\nFor all confidential research data hosted outside University networks – on University licensed systems such as Microsoft Stream, OneDrive, SharePoint - electronic records should be protected with passwords and encrypted as outlined in UoD IT security and storage guidance. Further information is available at UoDIT guides.\\n\\nIf students use a personal laptop or home PC to access University data, they are required to either encrypt their device, or ensure they do not hold data that is private or confidential on it. Access to research data should be controlled to prevent unauthorised use, removal or destruction of the data themselves and unauthorised disclosure of information they contain.\\n\\nResearch data containing personal data must be handled with particular care to ensure compliance with the provisions of the applicable data protection legislation, UK Data Protection Act (2018) or any statutory modification or re-enactment thereof and The General Data Protection Regulation ((EU) 2016/679).\\n\\n## 5. Procedures\\n\\n### 5.1. File Naming\\n\\nResearch data should be organised for optimised accessibility and record keeping. Files should contain the following descriptive metadata within the filename:\\n\\nSupervisorSurname_Initial ResearcherSurname_Initial Project (name or grant number) Instrument Location Date Time Version\\n\\nAt a minimum the file name should observe the following format, using fields as appropriate;\\n\\nSupervisorSurname_Initial_ResearcherSurname_Initial_project_instrument_location_date_time_ver sion.ext7\\n\\n### 5.2. Backing up data\\n\\nResearch data held on laptops, PCs, instruments and within electronic lab books should be backed up onto approved University storage daily – or as soon as the student is able - to prevent loss of data through accidental or intentional damage or destruction (PGMRD 2.3). The file naming convention described previously must be applied to all research data files.\\n\\n### 5.3. Completion of studies\\n\\n#### 5.3.1. Appraisal of data\\n\\nWhen the student completes their undergraduate studies research data must be appraised in accordance with the Data Management Plan and retained for a period of 12 months on University approved storage.\\n\\n#### 5.3.2. Maintaining Access\\n\\nThe supervisor must ensure that editor access to data has been transferred to the School. Research data will be retained on approved University storage facilities for a period of 12 months. Data should be converted to open file formats where possible and practical.\\n\\n#### 5.3.3. Retention of data\\n\\nThe University of Dundee retention policy for research data is outlined in the Policy to Govern the Management of Research Data. Students are permitted to take a copy of their research data where data are not sensitive and where permission has been obtained from the supervisor.8 (PGMRD 2.12).\\n\\n#### 5.3.4. Reuse of data\\n\\nIt may be useful to keep research data beyond a year – where they are of continuing valuento the supervisor. If a supervisor decides to retain the data beyond a year then it is considered Research Data (rather than student data) and is governed as such by PGMRD and the Formal Policy Guidance Notes for the Management of Research Data.\\n\\n#### 5.3.5. Publication and sharing\\n\\nWhere undergraduate research substantiates published research findings or is associated with an external grant, supervisors should be aware of the research funder’s requirements for publication of specific categories of data. (PGMRD 2.1 and 2.8). As stated in the PGMRD 2.7 and 2.8 research sponsors may specify requirements for retention of specific categories of data. Research data which have been published by the University for reuse by third parties should be made known to the LLC and recorded in Pure; (See PGMRD 2.5 for guidance).\\n\\nFor an overview of funders policies see  \\n\\nClarification of funder policy and support with compliance is provided by LLC Research Services, contact discovery@dundee.ac.uk.\\n\\n### 5.4. Data that is to be destroyed\\n\\nWhen judged to be of no further value or when the 12 month retention period described expires research data should be destroyed. Destruction should be authorised by staff with appropriate authority, such as the supervisor or their designated administrator and should be carried out in accordance with the University’s Guidance on the proper disposal of information.\\n\\nSupervisors who are leaving the institution and are transferring an ongoing project must notify the School and provide authorisation for destruction of undergraduate student research data at Dundee following completion of the transfer.\\n\\n## 6.

From new students to experienced researchers, ensuring that research materials are well managed throughout the research project, and beyond, enables UEA’s research to have the greatest possible reach and benefit to the academic community and the wider public.\\n\\n### Review\\n\\nThis Research Data Management Policy sets out the University’s position on the management of Research Data.  This is a rapidly-evolving area and the supporting document on Research Data\\n\\nManagement Procedures and Guidance will be updated as the resources and infrastructure to support Research Data management are developed throughout the University.\\n\\nThis Policy will be reviewed and updated by the University Research Ethics Committee (UREC) and recommendations will be made to the University Research Executive, and thereafter to Senate before 31 December 2025.\\n\\n## Contents\\n\\nIntroduction .. 3\\nScope.. 3\\nDefinitions.. 3\\nPrinciples.. 4\\n\\n### Introduction\\n\\nThe University of East Anglia recognises Research Data as a valuable institutional asset to be managed in line with UKRI Common Principles on Research Data (  In addition, the University acknowledges the role that good Research Data management can play in supporting the University’s research vision to ensure that our research has the highest possible global influence through a dissemination strategy that maximises impact and that ensures effective communication of our research.\\n\\nThe purpose of this Policy is to ensure that Researchers and support staff:\\n\\nare supported in good Research Data management practice.\\nfind it easier to conduct research relying on Research Data.\\nbenefit from improved citations of their work.\\ncan maximise impact of their research by encouraging discoverability and re-use.\\nhave a reduced likelihood of data loss through inaccessibility and corruption.\\ncan comply with legislation and the policies and requirements of research funders and of Third Party Data providers.\\nare supported in protecting intellectual property and commercialisation opportunities.\\n\\n## Scope\\n\\nThe University’s Guidelines for Good Practice in Research1  outline what is expected of its Researchers. This policy and the associated guidance2 expand on this with respect to Research Data. As such, this policy applies to all UEA Researchers. It is the responsibility of heads of Faculties, Schools and Units to ensure their staff and students are aware of and comply with these policies.\\n\\n### Definitions\\n\\nResearch Data  There is no single definition of what constitutes Research Data. For the purposes of the University’s Research Data Management Policy and the associated Procedures and Guidelines, the following definition, from the Concordat on Open Research Data3, provides an indication of the scope: “Research data are the evidence that underpins the answer to the research question, and can be used to validate findings regardless of its form (e.g. print, digital, or physical). These might be quantitative information or qualitative statements collected by researchers in the course of their work by experimentation, observation, modelling, interview or other methods, or information derived from existing evidence. Data may be raw or primary (e.g. direct from measurement or collection) or derived from primary data for subsequent analysis or interpretation (e.g. cleaned up or as an extract from a larger data set), or derived from existing sources where the rights may be held by others. Data may be defined as ‘relational’ or ‘functional’ components of research, thus signalling that their identification and value lies in whether and how researchers use them as evidence for claims.”\\n\\nA definition of the research data should be provided in the Data Management Plan.4 Examples of research data include (but are not limited to): documents, spreadsheets, databases, field notebooks, diaries, audio- and video recordings, photographs and images, transcripts, survey responses, protein or genetic sequences, algorithms, computer code, workflows, standard operating procedures and protocols. All data gathered and generated as a result of the research, and not just analysed data that underpin a research output, are in scope. The mechanisms for retention and archive will necessarily differ according to the format of the data, or due to disciplinary norms. Where data are obtained from a third party, any adjustments to that base data set on which research relies should be included within the data generated as a result of the research.\\n\\nrchers The term Researchers is used to refer collectively to the following groups of people:\\n\\nAcademic, research and relevant support staff employed by the University, and other individuals carrying out research at, or on behalf of, the University Students undertaking research (including undergraduate research projects) and their supervisors\\nAny persons with honorary positions conducting research within, or on behalf of, the University.\\n\\nIn this document, the following verbal forms are used:\\n\\n“shall” and “must” indicated a requirement;\\n“should” indicates a recommendation;\\n“may” indicates a permission;\\n“can” indicates a possibility or a capability.\\n\\n## Principles\\n\\nThe University’s policy is based on the following principles:\\n\\n1. Publicly funded Research Data are a public good and should be made openly available wherever possible.\\n2. Research Data include both digital and non-digital forms and the definition of Research Data shall be guided by that widely accepted within the relevant discipline of the research.\\n3. Overall responsibility for Research Data Management at UEA rests with Research Executive. Every project must have a named Researcher responsible for data management. Researchers who are students shall seek advice about management and preservation of their research data from their supervisor(s), course/module director. All Researchers have a responsibility to familiarise themselves with this policy and the associated guidance.\\n4. UEA shall provide advice and support to Researchers in planning and managing their Research Data through the provision of training, guidance, good practice documentation and expert advice.\\n5. Best practice for the management of Research Data starts at the earliest stage of planning a research project and should cover all stages of the Research Data lifecycle, normally through the creation of a Data Management Plan which should be updated as necessary over the course of the research project. This should cover the requirements of working across various locations where necessary.\\n6. Researchers shall include a short statement within a research output describing how and on what terms supporting Research Data can be accessed.\\n7. Research Data that are made available shall be as comprehensive as possible and have clear instructions for use, including Metadata that facilitates discovery and reuse.\\n8. Research Data should be kept and remain available for access for at least 10 years following any publication, except when special circumstances apply.  Metadata should be kept indefinitely. Any additional documents required to enable sharing or reuse, or to meet legal or ethical obligations should also be retained for as long as is necessary to ensure continuing access of Research Data. In the case of undergraduate research projects, this requirement may be waived, where student and supervisor(s) or course/module director agree that this is not appropriate for that research project. This decision should be documented.\\n9. A Researcher should use an appropriate external repository or data centre which will archive and preserve Research Data, e.g. national, disciplinary or funder archive. Alternatively, if no such repository or data centre is available, Researchers should use a central repository provided by UEA.  Where the data are held externally, UEA will have a Metadata record for the data, including a link to the holding repository. There is no need to duplicate data in a central UEA repository if is held in another repository or archive.\\n10. Where the transfer of Research Data between organisations is required, it should be straightforward (e.g. research collaborations, Researchers moving between HEIs) but also secure and managed (i.e. not on an exclusive basis unless that is a condition of funding), and accompanied by appropriate documentation (eg data sharing agreements).  Where the Research Data have an assessed commercial value then additional steps will need to be followed before Research Data can be transferred.\\n11. Any destruction of Research Data shall be in accordance with the terms of this Policy, the retention period set out in the Data Management Plan and any legal and funder requirements, whichever is the most stringent.\\n12. All Researchers must comply with any policies, mandates and expectations around Research Data that are imposed by the university, their funders, as well as any wider legal or ethical requirements, including (but not limited to) relevant Data Protection and Freedom of Information legislation.\\n13. Researchers should recognise the Intellectual Property in all research outputs and processes, and manage it appropriately, in line with the University’s Intellectual Property Regulation.\\n14. The University’s Research Data policy and procedures will be reviewed and updated regularly.',\n",
       " \"# Research Data Management Policy\\n\\nPOLICY ADOPTED BY ACADEMIC BOARD ON 27TH FEB. 2019\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nThis policy applies to all research, funded or unfunded, created by UEL academics and research postgraduate students. It applies to all disciplines, including those in the arts and creative areas.\\n\\nThe University of East London (UEL) recognises that quality research demands effective data management in the support of academic integrity, openness, and good information governance. UEL will ensure that research data is managed to high standards throughout the research data lifecycle i as part of its commitment to academic excellence. This policy will ensure that UEL acts in accordance with UK Research and Innovation's Common principles on data policy ii , requirements of funding bodies, and general best practice.\\n\\nIt should be viewed in conjunction with the Code of Practice for Research Ethics, the Policy on Intellectual Property, the Data Storage & Retention Policy, and the Open Access Policy.\\n\\n## Definition\\n\\nResearch data is defined as information or material captured or created during the course of research, and which underpins, tests, or validates the content of the final research output. The nature of it can vary greatly according to discipline. It is often empirical or statistical, but also includes material such as drafts or prototypes that underpin creative or 'non-traditional' outputs. Research data is often digital, but includes a wide range of paper-based and other physical objects. Examples include, but are not limited to, the following:\\n\\nStatistical data held in spreadsheets or databases\\nTest, survey or questionnaire responses\\nInterview transcripts\\nNotebooks and fieldbooks\\nLaboratory test results\\nPrototypes\\nAudio and video recordings\\nPhotographs\\nSpecimens or samples\\nArtefacts\\nAlgorithms and scripts\\nDrafts or earlier versions of creative outputs, such as works of art or musical\\ncompositions\\n\\n# Research Data Management\\n\\n1. Research data created by UEL staff and research postgraduates must be managed in compliance with UK Research and Innovation’s Common principles on data policy and other relevant community standards throughout the research data lifecycle as part of UEL’s commitment to academic excellence.\\n2. Primary responsibility for compliance with this policy lies with Principle Investigators (PIs) or UEL lead investigators where the PI is not employed by UEL. For research postgraduates, primary responsibility lies with the student themselves.\\n3. Directors of Research will support and advocate for compliance with this policy. They will make arrangements for stewardship of datasets in the absence of PIs.\\n4. Library & Learning Services provide advice and guidance on best practice for managing research data and adhering to funder requirements and the requirements of this policy.\\n5. Library & Learning Services, supported by IT Services, provide the systems and technical infrastructure required to support this policy. This comprises UEL’s research data repository (data.uel), as well as data backup and archiving. This infrastructure ensures the long term integrity of UEL’s research data and ensures that funder requirements for secure storage and sharing of data can be fully met.\\n\\n## Data Management Plans\\n\\n6. Any research that generates empirical or statistical datasets or any other type of digital object must have a data management plan (DMP). All externally-funded research must have a DMP if required by the funder. A DMP is strongly advised for all other research. The completion of a DMP is the responsibility of the PI.\\n7. Any research that requires approval from the University Research Ethics Committee must have a DMP. This is a mandatory condition of the ethics approval process.\\n8. Research postgraduates must create a DMP if their research will generate empirical or statistical datasets or any other type of digital object. DMPs are strongly advised for all research conducted by research postgraduates. Responsibility for this lies with the student.\\n9. DMPs for funded research should adhere to the requirements of the funding body. Unless other guidelines from a funding body apply, DMPs should adhere to the guidelines in Annex A of UKRI’s Common principles on data policy. Library & Learning Services provide advice on DMP best practice.\\n10. Library & Learning Services and Research & Development Support (ReDS) must be provided with access to a copy of all DMPs.\\n\\n## Management of ‘live’ research data\\n\\n11. Anyone engaged in research at UEL must take all appropriate steps to ensure the security and integrity of research data as it is generated and worked upon. Instructions and requirements documented in the DMP must be adhered to at all times. Library & Learning Services and IT Services provide advice and guidance on management of live research data.\\n\\n## Depositing research data\\n\\n12. Depositing data has important benefits for researchers, UEL, and the wider scholarly community. Deposited data is protected and safeguarded, ensuring it is available for future consultation or reuse.\\n\\n13. All data must be deposited in a data repository where appropriate and the depositing arrangements specified in the DMP must be adhered to. Library & Learning Services provide further advice on whether it is appropriate for data to be deposited.\\n\\n14. Data should be deposited in UEL’s data repository (data.uel) unless an external repository has been specified by a research funder, or unless the PI or research postgraduate wishes to deposit in an alternative repository (e.g. a discipline-specific repository). Library & Learning Services must be informed of all datasets deposited somewhere other than data.uel so that a record linking to that dataset’s location can be created.\\n\\n15. Data should be deposited as soon as is practicable after the completion of the research and generally no later than the publishing of the results. Any timescales for upload imposed by external funders must be adhered to. It is recognised that time may be required to prepare data for deposit (e.g. to carry out anonymisation), but this must not unduly delay the deposit of the data, or its release where appropriate.\\n\\n16. Researchers are responsible for preparing research data for depositing. Library & Learning Services provide advice about preparation.\\n\\n17. Where UEL is not the lead institution, it is expected that the lead institution will take responsibility for depositing the data in an appropriate repository. UEL will not add a duplicate of the dataset to data.uel, but will create a record linking to the dataset’s location.\\n\\n18. A Digital Object Identifier (DOI) will be assigned to datasets stored on data.uel to enable effective citation, discovery, and access. Data will be linked to relevant outputs in UEL’s open access publications repository, ROAR.\\n\\n19. There is a presumption of releasing data created at UEL, with appropriate safeguards, in order to meet regulatory and contractual requirements. All data should be fully released, with appropriate safeguards, including secure dissemination, unless there are specific reasons to prevent this.\\n\\n20. Personal or sensitive data must be anonymised where it is appropriate for release in other respects. It is recognised that there will always be some data too sensitive for general release, even with anonymisation. The UEL Data Protection Officer provides advice and guidance on what is inappropriate for general release.\\n\\n21. In all cases, the legitimate interests, rights, and freedoms of participants must be protected in line with data protection legislation and research ethics approval.\\n\\n22. Library & Learning Services supports researchers in creating appropriate and high quality metadata, which will enable other researchers to understand the research and the re-use potential of the data. Where data cannot be made available openly, the metadata should state the reasons why.\\n\\n23. Data must be appraised (reviewed) at the end of the research project and every 5 years thereafter, unless another timescale is specified by the research funder, until the data are transferred or destroyed. PIs are responsible for ensuring this is carried out and for taking any decisions about whether data should be transferred or destroyed. If the PI has left UEL, this responsibility will fall to the relevant Director of Research. Advice may be sought from Research and Development Support (ReDS), Library & Learning Services, and UEL’s Data Protection Officer. In any cases where there is disagreement over whether data should be destroyed, the Pro-Vice Chancellor (Impact & Innovation) will take the final decision.\\n\\n24. Library & Learning Services will assist PIs in transferring data to external services where appropriate and record any transfers and destruction of datasets.\\n\\n25. Exclusive rights to reuse or publish research data should not be handed over to commercial publishers without retaining the rights to make the data openly available, unless this is a condition of funding.\\n\\n26. Library & Learning Services will provide reporting on this policy and its implementation to the Research & Knowledge Exchange Committee and other bodies as appropriate.\\n\\n27. All UEL-led research, regardless of format, duration, funding, or collaboration must adhere to all relevant UEL policies. Failure to do so may result in the removal of ethics approval, support, or the premature closure of a project.\",\n",

Our research will focus on asking difficult questions, challenging conventional wisdom, tackling with rigour the questions that matter for people and communities and putting ideas into action to improve people’s lives.\\n\\nThe University of Essex recognises that sharing research data is an important contributor to the impact of research, increasing the visibility of research, reinforcing open enquiry and allowing results to be independently tested, improving the overall quality of research.\\n\\n### Purpose\\n\\nThis policy sets out how research data at the University of Essex is managed throughout the data lifecycle so as to ensure transparency and appropriate access, supporting research funders, including UK Research and Innovation’s expectation to make research data arising from its funding as open as possible and as restricted as necessary. (See: Making your research data open – UKRI)\\n\\n### Scope\\n\\nThis policy encompasses all data from research that has the potential for publication, regardless of whether or not the research is funded. It applies to doctoral and postdoctoral research and may apply to undergraduate and masters level research.\\n\\n# Research Data Management Policy\\n\\n### Research Integrity\\n\\n1. Research data must be managed to the highest standards throughout the research data lifecycle as part of the University’s mission for  research excellence and commitment to Research Integrity.\\n\\n2. The interests of human participants in research must be protected during all stages of the data lifecycle (See University of Essex Guidelines for Ethical Approval of Research Involving Human Participants) (.pdf).\\n\\n### Responsibilities\\n\\n3. Responsibility for managing data for any research project or programme lies with Principal Investigators or with individual researchers (academic staff or students) working on their own. All staff and students must follow the IT Acceptable Use Policy and our Information Security Policy (.pdf).\\n\\n4. The University is responsible for raising awareness of good practice and obligations with respect to research data, and for the provision of useful platforms, guidance, and services in support of current and future access, during and after completion of research projects.\\n\\n### Storage\\n\\n5. Research data must be offered and assessed for deposit and retention in an appropriate national or international data service or subject repository, or the University research data repository.\\n\\n6. University will, wherever practicable, provide mechanisms and services for secure storage, backup, registration (including ensuring that data has sufficient metadata and can be assigned a Digital Object Identifier (doi), deposit and retention of research data assets in support of current and future access, during and after completion of research projects.\\n\\n7. Any data which is created as part of research at the University, but which is retained elsewhere, for example in an international data service or subject repository, should be registered with the University through the University research data repository.\\n\\n### Security Sensitive Material\\n\\n8. Researchers, both staff and students (postgraduate and undergraduate), using security-sensitive material should be aware of and comply with the University’s Security-sensitive Research Material Policy and Procedures.  The University has separate secure storage for such material and a registration process.\\n\\n### Data Management Plans\\n\\n9. The Principal Investigators for each research project or programme are responsible for the creation and ownership of an appropriate research data management plan, aligned with the FAIR principles, and for ensuring that all members of the research team are aware of, understand and abide by the plan. When the project or programme involves collaboration with any external partner, there should be an agreement regarding the rights and responsibilities of each party with respect to data collected, including key decisions about data storage, backup and security, registration, access, transfer, retention, destruction or archiving and licensing.\\n\\n10. All research proposals must include research data management plans that explicitly address data types, formats and volume, capture, storage, management, documentation and metadata, integrity, confidentiality, retention and destruction, sharing and publication.  A suggested minimum period of retention is three years from the end of the project, however requirements by funders and data providers, as well as disciplinary guidance should be observed, as this it may be substantially greater. Data should be made available in perpetuity wherever possible.\\n\\n11. The University will provide training, support, advice and where appropriate guidelines and templates for research data management and research data management plans. Further information is available on data management plans and data protection and research activity.\\n\\n### Access and sharing\\n\\n12. Research data management plans must ensure that research data are available for access and reuse where legally, ethically and commercially appropriate, taking note of any relevant safeguards and with reference to the University Open Research Position Statement (.pdf). Data release will be timely, as appropriate to the nature of the research and the discipline.  Published research outputs should include a short statement describing how, and on what terms, any supporting research data may be accessed.\\n\\n13. In determining access rights for research data, the rights and freedoms of the subjects of research data must be safeguarded, in line with the University’s and the researchers’ obligations in law and with any provisions of the data management plan. The rights of citizen scientists and the public to access publicly funded research should also be considered. When open access to datasets is not legal or ethical, information governance restrictions on access and use must be applied as necessary.\\n\\n14. Written agreements are required when personal data (any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person) is passed from a data controller to a data processor or another data controller, or to a country not bound by the General Data Protection Regulation or equivalent privacy legislation. Written agreements are also useful when the data being shared although not personal data, are confidential or valuable to the parties involved.  The University’s Research and Enterprise Office can assist with providing templates for both incoming and outgoing research data and the drafting and negotiation of the agreements concerned. Exclusive rights to reuse or publish research data should not be transferred to commercial publishers or agents without retaining the nonexclusive rights to make the data openly available for re-use unless this is a condition of funding.\\n\\n### Policy ownership and review\\n\\n15.

       " \"# University of Greenwich Statement on Scholarly Communication\\n\\nThe University of Greenwich is committed to expanding the total proportion of our research and scholarship outputs, and their underlying research data, that are published in open access (OA) forms.\\n\\nThe university is committed to enabling its active researchers to share the results of research through a range of open means in order to maximize research impact within the academic research community and across society more broadly. The university also supports the use of research identifiers for all researchers, such as ORCID; it is currently mandatory for anyone on a research career pathway to obtain and use their ORCID.\\n\\nThis statement and the policies that follow support the activities of many key research funders that now make the OA publication of outputs and data a condition of funding. This includes Research England, which requires articles and conference papers accepted for publication to be available in an appropriate open access format in order to be eligible for the Research Excellence Framework (REF).\\n\\nThe following policies apply to all staff and any postgraduate students actively engaged in research activity:\\n\\n## Publications Policy\\n\\nThere are two main routes to OA for publications, known as Gold and Green. The university holds a general preference to follow the Green route for publications by depositing appropriate copies into a recognised OA repository. Consequently, all staff and postgraduate students must make a record in the University of Greenwich Academic Literature Archive (GALA) for all published research outputs. For articles and conference proceedings (with an ISSN), an accepted manuscript must be uploaded to GALA within three months of acceptance, and the embargo period must not exceed a 12 month maxima (Panels A & B) or a 24 month maxima (Panels C & D1.)\\n\\nWhere researchers use the Gold route to OA, whether in a gratis OA journal, through the university’s participation in a Transformative Agreement with a publisher, or supported by project funds, a record of the output must still be added to GALA.\\n\\nWhere an author is licensing their research outputs and publications under an open or Creative Commons licence, the university takes a scholar-led approach. As such, the licensing decision is the responsibility of the individual researcher, unless they are in an agreement with a research funder or other associated external organisation that frequently mandate the use of specific open licences.\\n\\nIn order to optimise the potential impact of research outputs, this policy strongly recommends the most open licence available in order to help maximise impact potential and allow the university to actively contribute to the construction of the scholarly commons. Where institutional funds are involved in the access to an opportunity to openly license an output, such as through participation in a Transformative Agreement, open licensing opportunities should be agreed with Research Development Services.\\n\\nIn support of this policy, the university commits to support and train academic and research staff in understanding OA and the Research England policy for REF, as well as choosing journals and licences that allow outputs to be compliant with institutional external policies and mandates.\\n\\nThe university also commits to maintaining GALA, optimising it for emerging publication types and supporting its ongoing use with training and online materials.\\n\\nGALA forms an institutional record of the research and scholarship published by the university's research community, helping to protect and preserve the scholarly record. Records are anticipated to be kept permanently, but where appropriate, the Takedown Policy exists to fairly handle the removal of any records as required.\\n\\n## Research Data Policy\\n\\nThe university takes the definition of research data as:\\n\\n“evidence that underpins the answer to the research question, and can be used to validate findings regardless of its form (e.g. print, digital, or physical) … [including] statistics, collections of digital images, sound recordings, transcripts of interviews, survey data and fieldwork observations with appropriate annotations, an interpretation, an artwork, archives, found objects, published texts or a manuscript” (The Concordat Working Group, 2016).\\n\\nMaking research data accessible for reuse and to increase its potential impact is a key objective for UK Research Councils, and they have played a leading role in the development of the Concordat on Open Research Data on which this policy document is based.  Other funding agencies such as UK Government Departments, EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation and various charitable foundations have developed policies to encourage more open access to research data.  In addition, journal publishers are advocating that access to the underlying data should be an intrinsic part of the academic publishing process.\\n\\nIn accordance with the principles laid out in the Concordat on Open Research Data, all appropriate data generated by projects supported or led by University of Greenwich staff, as appropriate, shall be made openly available with as few restrictions as possible. When legally, commercially and ethically appropriate, data will be uploaded to an appropriate funder repository2 in a timely and responsible manner. If an appropriate data repository cannot be found, datasets must be uploaded to GALA.\\n\\nData should be retained for a minimum of 10 years from the end of the project, or from publication of an output relating to the research, whichever comes first. Where funder or other legal requirements specify a longer retention period, this should be observed.\\n\\nResearch data that must be retained after project completion include:\\n\\na. Data that support research findings3,\\nb. Data that are of potential long-term value,\\nc. Data that support patent applications\\nd. Data which are subject to other legal requirements for data retention.\\n\\nResearchers should avoid retaining data solely using methods that might not persist for 10 years, such as on project websites, personal computing equipment or in formats limited to proprietary software. Researchers are permitted to have an embargo period on their research data to complete their work, publications, or intellectual property filing on that data, before release.\\n\\nDatasets hosted in funder or subject repositories must still be registered with the university, either during the closure of a project, or by contacting researchsupport@gre.ac.uk.\\n\\nAll research proposals must include a data management plan, regardless of whether it is required by the funder. Researchers should also ensure that research proposals include a budget, where applicable, to cover the costs of managing research data in both the short and longer term.\\n\\nAll data handlers and processors have responsibilities for the data collected, created, stored, and/or preserved. However, the Principal Investigator (PI) may have overall responsibility for the implementation of data management plans of a research project, in order to ensure that research data are available for access and re-use where appropriate and with the necessary safeguards. All of this must be undertaken in line with the university’s relevant policies4.\\n\\nThe university recognises its responsibility to ensure researchers are supported throughout the research process to ensure full compliance with funder data policies and contractual requirements on research data management. The university commits to support academic and research staff in choosing a repository as well as writing data management plans, selecting and appraising data for storage, and in understanding and meeting any other requirements.\\n\\nReferences and endnotes\\nConcordat Working Group.

Introduction\\n\\nThe social standing of academic inquiry and of universities in general will only be maintained and enhanced if all research is done in an appropriate and ethical manner, including protecting the confidentiality of personal information, while at the same time enabling peer review and verification of data.\\n\\nTo protect people during research, especially vulnerable people, means supporting good practices that deal with data management and ethical aspects.\\n\\nThis document outlines the general policy relating to Research Data Management (RDM) in the Faculty of Spatial Sciences, and it lays out what is expected of staff and PhD students based in the Faculty. The document links to and needs to be read alongside other documents such as the policies on research ethics. For the learning environment of bachelor and master students a ‘light’ version of this data management policy is applicable, while learning skills on data management is part of the educational programme.\\n\\nThis document is updated regularly and aligned with the central RUG research portal (  and follows a range of procedures and protocols that have been implemented at European, Dutch and University levels. Of particular note is the legal requirement of the university to comply with the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It is therefore important that staff and PhD researchers are aware of and comply with this policy and the requirements and general expectations it discusses.\\n\\nThe Faculty’s overall position is one that accepts that its academic staff and PhDs are professional and competent, but acknowledges that it is the Faculty’s legal and social responsibility to provide appropriate oversight and monitoring in an efficient way.\\n\\n## 2.  Governance and standing of this document\\n\\nThis revised research data management (RDM) policy document was developed in response to the UG Research Data Policy 2021, and is consistent with university trends around the world. This document will be revised from time to time and is subject to changes in the various regulations that underpin it. It also needs to be read alongside the following documents:\\n\\nthe Faculty’s policy and procedures on Research Ethics the Faculty’s URSI Research Data Repository: Storage Protocol\\n\\nFurthermore, the following documents provide extra context:\\n\\nthe 2017 University of Groningen Code of Conduct on Integrity\\nthe 2018 Netherlands Code of Conduct for Research Integrity\\nthe European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity\\nthe European General Data Protection Regulation\\nUG Research Data Policy 2021\\nthe 2018 Code of Ethics for Research in the Social and Behavioural Sciences\\ninvolving Human Participants (Nethics)\\n\\n## 3.  Scope\\n\\nThe subject matter of this policy is the proper management of all data processed in research activities at the Faculty of Spatial Sciences and research data processed in collaboration with national and international research partners. Specifically relevant here are ‘Personal data’.  Personal data is any information that relates to an individual who can be directly or indirectly identified. Names and email addresses are obviously personal data. Location information, ethnicity, gender, biometric data, religious beliefs, web cookies, and political opinions can also be personal data. Pseudonymous data can also fall under the definition if it’s relatively easy to ID someone from it.\\n\\n‘Data’ should also be taken as ‘digitized data’. Data that exist in paper format (e.g. questionnaires) fall within the scope of this plan only to the extent to which they can be digitized.\\n\\n## 4.  Rights and responsibilities relating to this policy\\n\\nThis policy document and the procedures in it apply to all staff involved in research and all PhD students in the Faculty. For students the Data Protection Guide for Student Research has been developed in the context of the learning environment, when writing a bachelor or master thesis or an article. This is described in section 11.\\n\\nResearchers are regarded as being responsible in their own right for compliance with these requirements and are expected to follow the current procedure of ethics approval, overseen by their supervisors. Apart from familiarity with the expectations of research data management in general, for each specific research project or PhD project, the following requirements apply.\\n\\n1. Shortly after commencement of a research project, the principal investigator (for a funded project to a staff member) or PhD student (for a PhD project) needs to complete a Research Data Management Plan using the online tool available (click on this link) in anticipation of other tools  which might be implemented in the context of the RUG wide Research gateway. This must be done for all projects irrespective of their data requirements. In situations where there is no use of data, the RDMP Tool is very easily completed, but must be done to ensure that the Faculty is exercising its oversight responsibility. Should there be a significant change to data or methodology over the course of a project, it is the researcher’s obligation to provide an update to the RDM Plan and to revise what is stored on the RDMP Tool. Researchers will be expected to adhere to the plan (as updated from time to time) and that they and the Plan comply with the expectations described in this document.\\n\\n2. Near completion of the research project, the principal investigator or PhD student will need to archive all data in an appropriate digital and anonymised form in the Faculty Research Data Repository. This is currently the Y-drive on the University’s network until a RUG wide repository has been installed. The researcher’s data should also be accessible by the supervisor, at least when the PhD project has ended.\\n\\n3. Repositories such as Dataverse are also allowed, e.g. in case of EU-funded projects:  \\n\\n## 5.  Overarching principles\\n\\nThis policy is informed by several key overarching principles that govern research at the University of Groningen and at universities in general:\\n\\nAll research is to be undertaken in an ethical and legally responsible manner, paying due respect to all participants in the research process, and in accordance with relevant legislation. Although there are many aspects to ethical research, the concept of informed consent is fundamental. Essentially, all research participants should be fully informed about all aspects of the research, including plans for the storage of data, and their informed consent has been obtained before their data is collected. With regard to research ethics policies and standard academic integrity we refer here to the RUG policy which is based on the Netherlands Code of Conduct for Research Integrity 2018.\\n  Research also applies to student research, carried out in the context of a bachelor or master thesis or the writing of an article. Learning skills on data management is part of the educational programme. This is elaborated upon in section 11.\\nWhen personal data are processed in research, then these must be handled in a way that meets the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). In particular, this entails the requirement to demonstrate that appropriate\\ntechnical and organizational measures to achieve privacy by design are in place. When possible, data needs to be anonymised.\\nResearch methodologies, experimental design, data, data analysis, statistics, results and interpretations should be subject to peer review and scrutiny, and all researchers should be able to substantiate their choices, and be able to provide access for validation of the integrity of the data.\\nWhere research is publicly funded, the results of the research should be made publicly accessible, either through the provision of open access publications or by making short summaries available.\\nWhere feasible and ethically appropriate, researchers will make their data FAIR (see section 12).\\n\\n## 6.  Research data management throughout the whole research process\\n\\n### (1) Planning research and data needs\\n\\nIn planning research and the methodology to be used, it is important to consider the ethical as well as practical implications of how the research is to be conducted and data collected and managed, especially the requirement to anonymise the data as soon as practical. Awareness of the requirements should influence the design of the methodology. The planning of the research must include the need to consider ethical issues and the requirements relating to data management. The resulting research data management plan should be registered via this link.\\n\\n### (2) Data collection\\n\\nData is to be collected in an ethically responsible way. During the data collection process, there needs to be security of data already collected. For example, questionnaires should be securely stored. Audio or video recordings should be transferred to a password protected device as soon as possible. Initially data is likely to be re-identifiable, with the identification kept separate to actual data; however, it should be anonymised as soon as practical. Ideally, data is stored directly onto the Y: drive.\\n\\nDuring field work, data can be stored initially on a personal computer or laptop if there is no internet possibility. The data will need to be uploaded onto the Y-drive regularly (depending on the circumstances). It is recommended to also upload on an encrypted external hard-drive and then delete data from the laptop. It is also good practice to encrypt the partition of the harddrive reserved for storing personal data. In case of loss or stolen laptop/devices this needs to be reported as a data breach via cert@security.rug.nl.\\n\\n### (3) Access to data during the research process\\n\\nExcept for legitimate requests relating to scientific integrity concerns, it is generally advisable to restrict access to data to the researcher and supervisor(s) only, and restrict access until such time that the researcher is completely sure that original research data have been verified (for coding accuracy) and maybe until all publications being produced from the data are finalised. However, all research participants have a right to see any data that pertains directly to them, and can request that data which refer to the research participant will be removed from the data set where this is feasible.\\n\\n### (4) Storage of data\\n\\nIn line with the Netherlands Code of Conduct for Scientific Practice and the policies of the University of Groningen, empirical data is required to be stored safely. In anticipation of a RUG wide repository, the Faculty manages a Research Data Repository (Y-drive). The FSS repository is in a digital form where every researcher has their own folder identified with a P-number. Researchers will be required to provide their data in an appropriate form (including anonymization). The function of the Faculty repository is to enable access only under certain specific circumstances relating to the need to be able to verify the data. The URSI Director in consultation with the researcher will be responsible for assessing any request to access data in the repository. Consistent with the prevailing requirements, data will be stored in this repository for a fixed period of 10 years. After 10 years, data that has not been made open access will be destroyed, though if needed data can be stored longer. Note that all data must be fully anonymised as soon as practical to do so.\\n\\nNote that the Faculty data repository is not an open access facility, it is merely established to allow scrutiny in relation to legitimate concerns about scientific integrity. To comply with the open access expectation, researchers might need to identify an appropriate open access data provider, such as might be provided by a scientific institute or a journal publisher.\\n\\n### (5) Cybersecurity\\n\\nA cyber security incident is a situation involving a breach of the security of the UG’s information systems and the data stored within them. A data breach is a situation in which the security of personal data has been compromised.\\n\\nExamples of a cyber-security incidents and data breaches are:\\n\\nA laptop gets stolen or is lost.\\nA data set containing personal information has been accidentally shared with a number of people who should not have access.\\nA couple of signed consent forms have been left in public transport.\\n\\nAlways report cyber security incidents (whether these are confirmed or suspected) and data breaches to the Computer Emergency Response Team via cert@security.rug.nl. This contact desk is also available for reporting incidents that require confidentiality.\\n\\n## 7.  Responsibility for data management\\n\\n‘Ownership’ is a word with legal implications, and strictly speaking the ownership status of data is complicated by the employment status of the researcher as well as of any grant funding received. Nevertheless, irrespective of the formal ownership of data, all researchers have a responsibility for care of data; and the University of Groningen has a responsibility relating to any research done under its auspices. Therefore, unless there is a specific agreement to the contrary, responsibility for data management relating to the data from a specific research project will be regarded as the responsibility of the principal investigator or  PhD team (PhD student and supervisors), indicated in the RDM Plan submitted for that project.\\n\\nResponsibility for data in cases when the researcher leaves the University In the case of a PhD researcher finishing their PhD or a staff member leaving to go to another institution, for all completed projects, it is expected that all (anonymised) data will be deposited in the Faculty Research Data Repository in an appropriate form, accessible by the researcher and supervisor(s). For ongoing projects that are to remain at the University of Groningen, an alternative principle investigator is to be nominated.\\n\\nResponsibility for data when a researcher joins the University transferring a project In the case of a finished project, it will normally be expected that the previous institution will manage the data storage provisions into the future. In cases where a staff member transfers a project, the Faculty will accept responsibility for the project and future data storage responsibility.\\n\\nOwnership and responsibility of data when cooperating with other\\norganizations/institutions\\nThis will be decided on a case by case basis, but for each project there must be a clear determination about which institution will be responsible for management of data and compliance with the requirements of the European General Data Protection\\nRegulation.\\n\\n## 8. Using personal data\\n\\nIn some cases researchers process personal data in their research. Researchers are therefore expected to understand the basic principles of the General Data Protection Regulation.\\n\\n### (1) The General Data Protection Regulation\\n\\nSince May 2018, all member states of the European Economic Area share the same data protection law: the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This law governs the processing of personal data both inside and outside the EU/EEA when this is done by organisations based in one of the member states. This law also applies to research activities by universities, even when these take place in non-member states.\\n\\nPersonal data in the GDPR are defined as “any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person” (Art. 4.1).  A ‘natural’ person means a living person. In the GDPR, there is no distinction between public and private/confidential data, only between personal and non-personal data. All personal data should be treated as confidential.\\n\\nIn case of secondary data, the researcher should check if consent is needed from the secondary data source. Also when using existing data, it is important that the respondent gave consent for these data to be re-used. (see  \\n\\nExamples of ‘identifiers’ are names, an identification number, contact details, location data, dates and times of meetings, IP-addresses, ethnicity, religious identity, or a combination of data that allows for a person to be identified as a unique individual. ‘Processing’ should be understood as any operation with data: gathering, viewing, analyzing, storing, sharing etc.\\n\\nThe GDPR sets constraints to what is possible with personal data and requires us to properly secure the data.\\n\\nWe expect staff:\\n\\nto take notice of the general principles of the GDPR. A special UG website has been created to inform everyone in the UG about the basic principles; to take standard precautions when handling data. Among these are e.g. creating strong passwords, anonymisation when possible, working on secure devices and working on the university’s network as much as possible. See the UG’s website for a general overview of the standard measures that you can take; in case of handling personal data in research to be demonstrably compliant, by creating and registering a data management plan and applying for approval of the Research Ethics Committee and by checking whether a DPIA is necessary.\\n\\n### (2) Demonstrating compliance\\n\\nA central principle in the GDPR is ‘accountability’. If researchers are planning to process personal data in their research, then they need to be able to demonstrate compliance with the GDPR. This means that researchers are expected to design their research in such a way that the private lives of participants as well as their rights and freedoms are minimally impacted, and that researchers can show how this will be achieved.\\n\\nResearchers are therefore expected to anonymise data when possible, design their research in a privacy-friendly way, think about appropriate technical and organizational measures, register their research proposal and follow the existing ethics approval procedure.\\n\\n### (3) Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)\\n\\nApart from a research data management plan, research involving living human beings may also require doing a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA).\\n\\nA full DPIA report:\\n\\nmaps the data privacy risks in the project;\\nassesses these risks; and\\ndefines protection measures to eliminate or mitigate the risks.\\n\\nPerforming a DPIA is legally required when data processing activities1 are likely to ‘result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons’ (art. 35 GDPR).\\n\\nAn exhaustive list of potential high-risk scenario’s cannot be given in advance, but in general, a DPIA may be necessary when researchers are planning to include sensitive personal data into their dataset (such as health data or ethnicity); when they involve innovative technologies (and companies) that process data; research with location data, GPS tracking of individuals or research that uses ‘profiling techniques’; when people may be in a vulnerable position (children, or people  who face imbalances in power relationships; or when they systematic monitor of publicly accessible areas without informing people (‘covert observation’). Projects that involve many different partners with different (non-academic) aims  may also be subjected to a DPIA.\\n\\nIf a DPIA is required, then this should take place before data processing starts. A DPIA can be supported by the Digital Competence Center and performed by a team of people involved in the project in question, including, for example, a subject expert, a privacy officer, an IT expert, and a student or staff member involved. The process may be timeconsuming. Researchers are therefore advised to contact the DCC as soon as possible (see section 20 on support).\\n\\nIf a DPIA has already been performed on a similar research project at our, or at a different research university in the EU/EEA zone, then this can also be used as a point of reference, provided that the data protection measures set out are demonstrably applied by the researcher.\\n\\nThe Privacy and Security Coordinator can advise whether a DPIA is necessary. The decision to do a DPIA is ultimately the responsibility of the Faculty Board.\\n\\n## 9.  Role of the Graduate School in research data management\\n\\nSome specific roles and responsibilities rest with the Graduate School. The Graduate School embeds the topic of data management in training activities for PhD researchers. Responsible data-management is an integrated part of scientific practice and is addressed in TSP plans and R&O conversations. GDPR is also part of the educational training for PhD candidates.\\n\\n1. The RUG Graduate Schools provide mandatory training (e.g. on academic integrity) to Research Master’s students and PhD students.\\n2. The Graduate Schools will oversee that PhD supervisors make arrangements with PhD students regarding data management and the recording of such arrangements in these students’ Training and Supervision Plans (TSP). In the TSP PhD thesis supervisors make arrangements, together with the PhD student, regarding the PhD student’s research data both during the project and (to be made available for further research) after the PhD project has concluded (Regulations of the conferral of a doctorate (PhD regulations) Art. 4.1.5.).\\n3. The Graduate Schools will oversee that PhD candidates  complete an RDMP using the RDMP Tool.\\n4. The Graduate Schools will ensure – with support from the UG DCC – that best practices in the field of data management education are shared.\\n\\n## 10.  Education, data management and student research\\n\\nThe main focus of this data management plan is on research activities performed by (temporary) staff and PhD students. Training is offered by UG to staff and PhD candidates to develop skills in data management. Students may also work with personal data and they may publish their findings as well. Their research activities therefore fall under the responsibility of the Faculty if the research activities are part of compulsory course units under supervision of a staff member, i.e. a bachelor and master thesis or a publishable journal article.  As data management is a learning process like others, making mistakes is part of this process. Teaching students how to learn and improve skills on data management is part of the educational programme (for example in the course Methods of Academic Research).\\n\\nIn terms of data management/GDPR/ethics, actions are restricted to the following educational activities, and only in case:\\n\\nstudents are collecting primary data (personal data) themselves for compulsory course units of the degree programmes for the Bachelor’s and /or Master’s thesis.\\nthe results of research are published, not only in journals but also for example in conference papers.\\n\\nThese actions are:\\n\\nStudents make a data management plan as part of the Bachelor’s or Master’s Thesis process if it includes personal data (for example retrieved via interviews). This also includes a dedicated paragraph in the written thesis.\\nThe student should follow instructions to handle data in a correct way (checked by the supervisor), storing the data in a secure place, protected by  two-factor authentication, adhering to good practice.\\nThe Faculty and the CIT are responsible for offering the student a secure storage space. This will be the Y-drive by default, unless the project requires otherwise (to be determined case by case).\\nStudents and/or their supervisor should register the project in a suitable format once the RUG Research Gateway is in place.\\n\\nThe thesis supervisor(s) are responsible for guidance concerning good data management. The Faculty Board is responsible for creating guidelines concerning data management of research performed by students.\\n\\n## 11.  Implementing open science, FAIR principles, and open access to data\\n\\nOne of the University’s policy goals is to make, in principle, all data FAIR. Below, the general requirements that the data (and software and scripts) must meet at the UG are integrated into the presently accepted terminology of the FAIR principles. The data are:\\n\\n### Findable:\\n\\nData is sustainably stored and curated;\\nData is provided with metadata, including affiliation and, if possible, with a persistent identifier;\\nData is registered on the basis of metadata in the research database of the university.\\n\\n### Accessible:\\n\\nData is accurate, complete, reliable, authentic and provided with metadata and, if possible, with a persistent identifier;\\nData is available for checking and further research after completion of the research and/or the departure of the researcher;\\nData is openly available, unless valid reasons prevent this.\\n\\nInteroperable:\\n\\nData is stored in sustainable file formats;\\nThe discipline specific standards for the enrichment of data are applied;\\nData (and metadata) is provided with references to other relevant material.\\n\\n### Reusable:\\n\\nThe origin of the data and the affiliation of the researcher involved is clear (Provenance);\\nThe discipline specific standards for data management are applied; The conditions for reuse are clearly described.\\n\\nFurthermore, open science and FAIR principles need to be integrated in the data process as much as possible. This policy is based on a “comply or explain” principle, meaning that exceptions to this policy are possible. A researcher may wish not to make the data publicly available when:\\n\\n1) Making the data publicly available would contradict any agreement or undertaken given as part of the informed consent process.\\n2) Where public release might have negative consequences for the people researched.\\n3) When there is an obligation or objective to protect results so that they can commercially or industrially exploited (or reasonably expected to be exploited).\\n4) Where public release could represent a security concern.\\n5) If open access would jeopardize achievement of the main aim of the research.\\n6) If there is any other legitimate reason not to publish the data.\\n\\nIf any of these reasons is to be claimed, the researcher can indicate this in the datamanagement plan.\\n\\n## 12.  Awareness-raising about data management\\n\\nThe Faculty will take appropriate steps to inform staff and PhD students about the policy and expected procedures. Specifically, from January 2018 on, all new PhD candidates will be required to complete training covering research ethics and research data management issues. Furthermore, a special section in the PhD Training & Supervision Plan shall be dedicated to data management. The Faculty will take care that procedures of dealing with data are properly embedded in the educational programmes.\\n\\n### Sharing Good Practices\\n\\nThe URSI Faculty Research Institute will emphasize sharing good practices amongst their researchers and PhD students. This will be done by means of:\\n\\n1. Organizing URSI (lunch) seminars with RDM as a central theme, thereby inviting and encouraging URSI staff and PhD students to attend.\\n2. Inter-faculty platforms that stimulate the exchange of knowledge and best practices on RDM. These platforms are, amongst others, the privacy- and security officer meetings and the faculty funding officers meetings.\\n3. Attending national platforms for ethical committees.\\n4. Formulating requirements on data management for BSc and MSc theses, to make this part of students' learning paths.\\n\\n### Training\\n\\nAwareness-raising about research data management is also realized by organizing workshops and training for our researchers and PhD students. These workshops have the aim to educate our researchers and PhD students in conducting responsible research.\\n\\nFor PhD students the workshop Academic Integrity is organized twice a year. RDM is a central theme during this workshop. Academic Integrity is a mandatory part of the URSI PhD program; the educational program for the PhD students of the Graduate School. Also, a RDM Workshop is being developed. This workshop is targeted at helping PhD students with the development of their RDM Plan in the Tool. Also, immediate feedback is given.\\n\\n## 13.  Ensuring compliance\\n\\nThe Faculty Board will maintain oversight and will supervise practices related to data storage and management.\\n\\nResearchers are responsible for submitting an RDMP within 3 months of commencement of a research project. A CIT/Library Data Steward is available for advice and reminders.\\n\\nAt the time of the 9 month go/no-go interview, all PhD candidates will need to declare that they are familiar with the Dutch Code of Conduct for Academic Practice; that they will obey this code. They will also be required to have completed a Research Data Management Plan using the Research Data Management Tool.\\n\\nOn completion of their PhD studies, the PhD team (PhD student and supervisors) will be responsible for ensuring that the PhD student will archive all research data in the repository. The data should be accessible by the supervisor after the PhD student has left. On termination of the contract of a staff member, data should be lodged in the repository.\\n\\n## 14.  Roles and Tasks\\n\\n1. This document  needs to be read and used alongside the following documents:\\n\\nthe Faculty’s policy and procedures on Research Ethics the Faculty’s URSI Research Data Repository: Storage Protocol\\n2. Researchers are responsible for following the aforementioned protocols, submitting a research data management plan for each project in the RDMP web tool (  and for archiving their data in the Faculty Research Data Repository.\\n3. The Data Steward (CIT/Library) is responsible for providing feedback to researchers on their data management plans and the storage of data in the Faculty Research Data Repository.\\n4. The Privacy and Security Coordinator is responsible for assessing data protection risks of research projects, for coordinating the DPIA-process and for further supporting researchers in taking risk mitigating measures.\\n5. The URSI director is responsible for providing instructions on data storage, the RDMP webtool and DMP formats, in collaboration with the Data Steward (CIT/Library) and for communicating data management policy to researchers, students and PhD students.\\n6. The Faculty’s director of Education, in collaboration with the Privacy and Security coordinator, is responsible for making a plan for training students in good data management practices and for embedding data management in the curriculum.\\n7. The CIT is responsible for providing suitable IT facilities for collecting, storage and archiving data for staff and students, on request of the FB.\\n8. The Departmental chairs are responsible for investigating the needs of staff members for further training in data management skills.\\n9. The Data Steward aligns data management procedures with other Faculties within the University.\\n10. The Data Steward supports the Faculty in implementing the Research Data Management System.\\n\\n## Applicable definitions\\n\\nFAIR-data stands for findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable data. This means that data or datasets should be archived in such a way that ideally the research results can be replicated. Metadata and data should be machine-readable in order to make it easy to find; anyone who finds the data should be able to know how they can be accessed; the data needs to interoperate with applications or workflows for analysis, storage and processing and, when there no objections the metadata and data should be welldescribed so that they can be replicated and/or combined in different settings.\\n\\nData Steward is an officer (at CIT/Library) who is responsible for managing and protecting an organization's data. They are responsible for making sure that data is stored, used, and shared in a way that is secure, compliant with relevant regulations, and aligned with the organization's goals and policies. Data Stewards can support researchers in managing their data according to policy.\\n\\nGDPR refers to Regulation 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council: the General Data Protection Regulation.

Responsibilities related to research data management\\n\\n3.1 Researchers’ responsibilities\\n3.2 Responsibilities of faculties and independent institutes involved in research\\n3.3 The University’s responsibilities\\n\\n### 4. Glossary\\n\\n### 1. Introduction\\n\\nResearch data are central to science and research. The production of data requires long-term efforts as well as technical and financial resources. In fact, the reusability of research data has become an increasingly important question in terms both of science and research, and of the impact of research.\\n\\nFor the University of Helsinki as well as its units and researchers, research data constitute a strategic resource and an international competitive factor. The goal of the University is to promote responsible research data management, which is of crucial significance for the findability, accessibility and reuse of research-based knowledge (for the definition of ‘research data’ and ‘research data management’, see the glossary).\\n\\nThe principles of open science and open research data play a prominent role in the strategic plan of the University of Helsinki for 2021–2030. The University’s strategic goals include open research infrastructures and open research data, the implementation of the FAIR Principles in research data management, and the advancement of competencies in the analysis of large and open datasets.\\n\\nA key goal of the research data policy is to guide everyone involved in research data management to familiarise themselves with current data management requirements as well as to adopt good and responsible practices as part of everyday research activities. Another goal is to make research data management increasingly clear for individual researchers.\\n\\nFrom an organisational perspective, the research data policy describes the goals that guide the development of research data services at the University of Helsinki. The goal is for University of Helsinki researchers to have at their disposal infrastructures and services that enable responsible research data management, developed in an economically sustainable manner while taking researchers’ needs into account.\\n\\nIn terms of its fundamental goals, the new research data policy of the University of Helsinki does not significantly differ from the previous policy published in 2015. The new policy has been amended to comply with current legislation as well as national and international guidelines and recommendations. In contrast to the previous policy, whose more limited scope only encompassed digital data, the new research data policy applies to all research data and related management principles. Another important change is the further clarification and highlighting of responsibilities.\\n\\n#### 1.1 Scope of the research data policy\\n\\nThis research data policy covers all research conducted at the University of Helsinki, as well as the research data collected and produced in conjunction with it. This denotes both digital data as well as physical and analogue data, which are all referred to as research data in the research data policy (for the definition of ‘research data’, see the glossary).\\n\\nThe research data policy applies to all members of the University community involved in research, including University employees and students as well as those who conduct research on behalf of the University.\\n\\n1.2 Other policies pertaining to research data management at the University of Helsinki\\n\\nThe principles and goals presented in the research data policy supplement other University of Helsinki policies relevant to the management of research data, including the principles of open science, the data protection principles, the information security policy and the guidelines of the Finnish National Board on Research Integrity for the responsible conduct of research. The research data policy is also in line with the University’s data management practices and principles.\\n\\nPolicies related to research data management at the University of Helsinki are guided primarily by EU and Finnish law. By employing policies and guidelines, the University strives to ensure the legality of research activities. In international research and other cooperation, research data management can also be regulated by legislation outside the European Union.\\n\\nExternal research funders and partners may also have specific requirements for research data management.\\n\\nThe general objectives for the processing of data stored in University of Helsinki research infrastructures or those on the national or international level are described in the University of Helsinki Research Infrastructure Programme (for the definition of ‘research infrastructure’, see the glossary). In addition, national and international research infrastructures may have their own jointly agreed policies for the processing of the data that they produce. When research infrastructures draw up or update their data management principles, their alignment with the University’s research data policy must be ensured.\\n\\n#### 1.3 Research agreements and agreeing on rights\\n\\n#### Research agreements\\n\\nConcluding agreements and undertakings is an important part of responsible data management, regardless of the source of research funding. Agreements are always needed when research is conducted in a collaboration or other partnership with external parties, such as other universities, businesses, research organisations and hospital districts. Agreements help to safeguard the interests of researchers and the University of Helsinki, manage risks related to research and ensure the legality of activities.\\n\\nResearch agreements must be concluded as early as possible, preferably before the collection or use of research data commences. Agreements are used to ensure that the research data collaboratively collected by research groups is available to all of the participating researchers. Agreements safeguard the continuity of research and the further use of research data, for example, after the conclusion of research projects.\\n\\n#### Agreeing on rights related to research data\\n\\nMany international and national research funders require that the research data and findings that they have funded are open access. Obligations imposed by funders on researchers and the University make it necessary to transfer rights to research data to the extent necessary to fulfil the funding terms. In addition, the sharing of rights is needed, for example, to enable the opening,\\n\\nfurther use and archiving of research data. As a rule, researchers retain a concurrent right that enables them to continue using the research data.\\n\\nThe rights related to research data and their sharing should be agreed when researchers’ employment at the University begins.\\n\\nAgreeing on the rights related to research data is in line with legislation and the responsible conduct of research. Instead of altering researchers’ responsibilities in the management of their research datasets, such agreements are part of it. Sharing rights does not alter researchers’ right to be referred to as the collectors or producers of the research data in question.\\n\\n#### 1.4 Updating and monitoring the research data policy\\n\\nThis document supersedes the current University of Helsinki research data policy that was approved in 2015. An implementation plan for the updated data policy will be drawn up in 2022.\\n\\nThe implementation of the research data policy will be monitored by carrying out assessments at regular intervals, the first in 2023.\\n\\nThe research data policy will be updated by 2025.\\n\\n### 2. Principles and goals for research data management\\n\\n#### 2.1 General principles\\n\\nBelow, the principles and goals for responsible research data management are described in relation to the lifespan of research projects, beginning from the planning of data management and ending in the long-term preservation or destruction of data. The potential for the further use of data must be taken into consideration during research projects.\\n\\nIn general, the responsible management of research data is guided by the FAIR Principles, according to which research data must be findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (for the definition of the ‘FAIR Principles’, see the glossary). Another guiding principle pertains to the openness of research data: as open as possible, as closed as necessary.\\n\\n#### 2.2 Planning and preparation of data management\\n\\nA data management plan is to be drawn up for all research projects. The plan is to be updated during the project whenever substantial changes are made to the content (for the definition of ‘data management plan', see the glossary).\\n\\nQuestions related to legislation and research ethics are taken into consideration in the data management plan.\\nWhen processing personal data, the University of Helsinki data protection guidelines on informing data subjects and ensuring the necessary safety measures are to be taken into account. When necessary, a data protection impact assessment must be carried out (for the definition of ‘personal data’, see the glossary).\\nThe rights and responsibilities related to research are to be agreed within research groups, while the relevant agreements are to be concluded with external parties prior to\\ncommencing the collection or use of research data.\\nPreparations must be made for the protection and, when necessary, anonymisation of sensitive data as well as the destruction of confidential data, with sufficient resources allocated at the planning stage of research projects (for the definition of ‘sensitive and confidential data', see the glossary).\\nAgreements, consents, undertakings and other documents related to research must be archived so that they are always available to researchers and support services.\\nResearch infrastructures extensively involved in service provision in particular should draw up a data management policy describing the principles of processing, storing, distributing, preserving and destroying data produced by the infrastructure, as well as the questions of responsibility and ownership related to the processing of data.\\n\\n#### 2.3 Documentation and processing of research data\\n\\nThe documentation and metadata associated with research data should follow disciplinespecific standards to enable the reuse and further enrichment of the data in future research projects (for the definition of ‘metadata’, see the glossary). Appropriate information security must be taken into consideration in the storage and processing of research data. The University provides researchers with basic services in the storage and processing of research data. If the quantity of data is high or special computing power is needed, the costs of storage and processing must be taken into consideration at the planning stage.\\n\\n#### 2.4 Publication and accessibility of research data\\n\\nResearch data produced at the University of Helsinki and linked to published research results are, as a rule, open and available for shared use. The principle of ‘as open as possible, as closed as necessary’ is observed when making research data openly available. Research data are published in data archives that safeguard the findability of data and enable references to them (for the definition of ‘data archive’, see the glossary).\\n\\nMetadata associated with research data must be published whenever possible, either in national or international metadata services.\\nIdentifiers and licences enabling the further use of data should always be available for open research data (for the definition of ‘persistent identifier’, see the glossary).\\nIf possible, sensitive data are also made available to other researchers, taking into consideration legal, ethical and contractual restrictions. In this, services that enable safe storage and restricted access with a research permit are to be employed.\\nThe University has practices and services for data collection and monitoring pertaining to previously collected, produced and opened research data.\\n\\n#### 2.5 Commercialisation of research data\\n\\nIn the case of commercially valuable data, measures must be taken to ensure that their use does not endanger commercialisation. For example, research results must be published in compliance with terms and conditions set on confidentiality by the funder as well as the University’s guidelines for commercialisation. In the case of research that generates commercially valuable research data, the University provides researchers with support and a streamlined service process.\\n\\n#### 2.6. Destruction or long-term preservation of research data\\n\\nThe part of research data that is valuable in the long term and that will be preserved, as well as the part that will be destroyed at the end must be specified during research projects. Research data that have become useless will be destroyed after the required storage period. Research data that contain sensitive data will be destroyed with particular care. The University has a process for the curation and transfer to long-term digital preservation of valuable research data (for the definition of ‘long-term preservation’, see the glossary).\\n\\n### 3. Responsibilities related to research data management\\n\\n#### 3.1 Researchers’ responsibilities\\n\\nFamiliarising themselves with guidelines related to responsible research data management\\nand complying with them\\nPlanning and implementing data management for their research\\nEnsuring that agreements, undertakings, and consents required for research are drawn up\\nand concluded\\nFamiliarising the members of their research group with responsible data management\\n\\nwhen serving as principal investigators\\n\\nEnsuring that data that have been agreed to be shared by the group or the collaborative\\nresearch project are accessible to others\\nConveying the principles and good practices of responsible data management when serving\\nas thesis supervisors\\nUpdating their skills in research data management on a regular basis\\n\\n#### 3.2 Responsibilities of faculties and independent institutes involved in research\\n\\n• Maintaining an overview of research data and their management in the unit, including the unit’s agreements and obligations\\n• Taking the research data policy into consideration in the planning of operations and finances, as well as allocating the necessary resources\\nIntegrating University-level guidelines and policies into unit operations, taking research field–specific differences into account\\nEnsuring that the academic staff and students are familiar with research data management as part of the responsible conduct of research\\nOffering and allocating resources for on-site support for research data management together with research support services\\nCarrying out preventive risk management and anticipating potential information security incidents (for the definition of ‘risk management’ and ‘information security incident’, see the glossary). Ensuring the implementation of responsible research data management in research infrastructures\\n\\n#### 3.3 The University’s responsibilities\\n\\nEngendering the necessary preconditions for the implementation of responsible research\\ndata management at the University\\nEnsuring that the University-level research data infrastructure is fit for purpose, up to date\\nand sufficiently funded so that services are available at all stages of research projects’\\nlifespans (For the definition of ‘research data infrastructure’, see the glossary.)\\nEstablishing, in collaboration with academic units, assessment practices and incentives to\\nconsider researchers’ efforts to promote the sharing and further use of research data as\\nwell as skills in research data management as academic merits\\nEstablishing incentives for University units for responsible research data management\\nPromoting opportunities for researchers and support services specialists to specialise in the\\nmanagement of research data by consolidating related specialist roles and developing\\ncareer paths\\nCoordinating development efforts related to research data management\\nDrawing up University-level policies for research data management and processes that\\nsupport their implementation\\nDrawing up the necessary guidelines for research data management\\nCarrying out and supporting preventive risk management and anticipating potential\\ninformation security incidents\\nOffering researchers and other staff training and orientation related to research data\\nmanagement\\nOffering researchers and academic units support in research data management\\n\\n### 4. Glossary\\n\\n#### Data archive (data repository)\\n\\nA virtual, typically discipline-specific archive or database where researchers can transfer their research data for sharing, reporting and reuse. Data repositories store research data, make it available and organise it in a logical manner. Data repositories also make it easier to cite research data through the use of persistent identifiers.\\n\\n#### Data management plan\\n\\nA document that describes the research data that will be acquired or produced in the research project, commonly abbreviated as DMP. In connection with data management plans, the term ‘data’ is understood in broad terms, meaning that it encompasses all of the data and resources on which the research results are based. The plan also encompasses codes, software and other methodological descriptions.\\n\\nIn addition, the plan describes how rights related to research data are managed, which agreements are needed, how data protection is ensured, how research data are stored, how research data are opened, or how their findability and use for the verification of the research results and further research is otherwise enabled. While the data management plan is drawn up at the planning stage, it is a living document that must be updated as the research project progresses.\\n\\n#### FAIR Principles\\n\\nEuropean principles for the quality of research data and associated metadata. The acronym FAIR stands for findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable. The FAIR Principles guide the drawing up of metadata in particular. Findable means that research data has a unique persistent identifier that functions as a link to the data that can always be found even if the storage location changes. Findability can also be implemented for non-digital research data whose metadata are openly available. Accessible means that research data and the associated metadata are accessible via web browsers. Interoperable means that data are stored using open file formats and common standards. Reusable means that research data has rich metadata and a licence that specifies the terms of reuse.\\n\\n#### Information security incident\\n\\nAn event or circumstances that diverge from normal, which may, for example, delay, prevent or harm the conduct of research. The nature of such incidents varies by research field.\\n\\nInformation security incident related to data protection refer to circumstances due to which research data are destroyed, lost, altered or disclosed without authorisation, or due to which an unauthorised party gains access to the data.\\n\\n#### Long-term preservation\\n\\nThe preservation of digital data in understandable and usable form for dozens or even hundreds of years. Long-term preservation is designed for valuable research data. The goal of long-term preservation is to ensure the accessibility, authenticity, understandability and completeness of digital objects, also regardless of the eventual obsolescence of or changes to hardware, software and file formats. Long-term preservation ensures the long-term availability of research data.\\n\\n#### Metadata\\n\\nMetadata is data about data. There are several types of metadata, including descriptive, structural, administrative, statistical and legal as well as reference and citation metadata. Metadata ensures the findability and reusability of research data. When research data is described and documented appropriately, other users can trace and understand specific elements of research. Metadata makes it easier to search for and find research data stored in data repositories.\\n\\n#### Persistent identifier\\n\\nA unique and unambiguous, machine-readable name for research output, commonly abbreviated as PID. Identifiers constitute permanent links that always lead to, for example, publications or metadata pages associated with research data. Persistent identifiers enable the long-term findability of digital research data.\\n\\n#### Personal data\\n\\nAny data that can be linked to living natural persons, that is, data associated with or linkable to an identified or identifiable person. Any data that can be used to indirectly identify a person, for example, by linking a specific detail to another detail that would enable identification (pseudonymised personal data) also constitute personal data. Personal data can be stored in, for example, digital files and databases, on paper, in card indexes, in document files and survey forms, or in audio or video recordings.\\n\\nAccording to data protection regulation, specific personal data constitute what is known as special categories of personal data, or sensitive personal data (see also ‘sensitive and confidential data’):\\n\\nData revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs or\\ntrade union membership\\nGenetic data\\nBiometric data processed for the purpose of uniquely identifying a person\\n\\nData concerning health Data concerning a person’s sex life or sexual orientation Data concerning criminal convictions or offences\\n\\nIn addition to the data above, the processing of personal data can be sensitive if the processing may pose risks to the data subjects (see ‘risk management’).\\n\\n#### Research data\\n\\nData that have been collected, observed, measured or created to verify research results, or that are otherwise considered necessary in the research community for the confirmation of results. The context turns data into research data. Any data can become research data when it is analysed for research purposes.\\n\\nResearch data can include measurement results, test results, survey results, audio and video recordings as well as samples and specimens. While research data is often in digital form, it can also include physical or analogue data. Research data can be raw data, processed data, data in the possession of a third party, shared data or published data. The degree of openness of research data varies from confidential and sensitive data to open data.\\n\\n#### Research data infrastructure\\n\\nProcesses, technical solutions and services through which research data management is carried out in practice. Research data infrastructures involve organisation, an operating culture and longterm social networks that enable the realisation of technical and administrative solutions and services.\\n\\n#### Research data management\\n\\nCommonly referred to using the abbreviation RDM. A process encompassing the lifespan of the research project that includes the collection or acquisition, organisation, curation, storage, (longterm) preservation, protection, quality assurance, licensing and distribution of research data as well as the use of persistent identifiers and other metadata in compliance with the rules and procedures of the relevant discipline (European Commission/Horizon Europe).\\n\\n#### Research infrastructure\\n\\nResearch infrastructures are instruments, equipment, information networks, databases, materials and services that serve to facilitate research, promote research collaboration and reinforce research and innovation capacity and know-how (Academy of Finland).\\n\\n#### Risk management\\n\\nProactive anticipation of events that have negative consequences. Risk management constitutes coordinated activities used to guide, manage and monitor the actions of the University, its units or individual researchers in relation to risks. The purpose of risk management is to help the University, its units and researchers to attain their goals and make decisions.\\n\\nWhen processing personal data (see the definition of ‘personal data’), the risks associated with the processing must be assessed while ensuring the implementation of the relevant data protection principles. In the case of personal data, the risk assessment must be carried out from the perspective of data subjects.\\n\\n#### Sensitive and confidential data\\n\\nResearch data whose storage, use and sharing are restricted on ethical, legal, contractual or commercial grounds. Such data must be processed and protected with particular care.\\n\\nSensitive data are associated with, for example, specific personal data (see special categories of personal data in the definition of ‘personal data’), endangered species, biosecurity or national defence. Confidential information on patents and trade secrets are also to be protected, and their exposure can result in claims for damages.\",\n",

       " '# RESEARCH DATA MANAGEMENT POLICY\\n\\n## 1. Introduction\\n\\n### 1.1 Statement of intent\\n\\n1.1.1 The University of Huddersfield’s academic community produces large volumes of research data, and wishes to ensure the widest possible access to its world-class research. The value and utility of research outputs increases the more broadly they are available to be considered and used by others, including scholars, businesses and charities around the globe, as well as society in general. Open Data and shared research data will also help to highlight the excellence of its research. It will attract scholars and students, foster collaboration, and enhance public engagement with research, as well as maximise the intellectual, social, cultural and economic impact of research.\\n\\n1.1.2 The University of Huddersfield supports the Concordat on Open Research Data and the UKRI general policies and guidance on research data which encourage members of the UK research community to make openly available research data they have gathered and generated.  The University is committed to reviewing new initiatives in this area as they arise and supporting them as deemed appropriate.\\n\\n1.1.3 The University of Huddersfield also recognises that good practice in data management is key to an efficient and effective research process. It is essential for enabling and safeguarding the longevity and continuing intelligibility of data, and for ensuring that sensitive data is handled in compliance with all relevant ethical and legal requirements. Preserving the data that underpins research outputs, whether it is shared or not, is integral to research integrity and reproducibility of results.\\n\\n### 1.2 Purpose\\n\\n1.2.1 There is an increased requirement on researchers to effectively preserve their research data with the intention of sharing it publicly, while at the same time respecting concerns in relation to privacy, safety, security and commercial interests; this is under the assumption that the outputs of University research are a public good, produced in the public interest and for societal benefit. This policy aims to establish the measures needed to facilitate the appropriate curation and management of data, to secure its longevity and its potential to be shared.\\n\\n1.2.2 This policy is intended to help promote good practice around research data, with the particular aim that it is:\\n\\nstored securely and preserved in order to ensure its continuing utility; appropriately identifiable, retrievable, and available when needed; an accurate, complete, reliable and coherent representation of the materials collected;\\nkept in a manner that is compliant with legal obligations, including the Data Protection Act 2018 / The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 2018 and the Freedom of Information Act 2000, and, where applicable, the requirements of funding bodies;\\nable to be made available to others in line with appropriate ethical, data sharing and open access principles, especially when the data\\nunderpins published research.\\n\\n### 1.3 Definition of Research Data\\n\\nResearch data: the recorded information (regardless of the form or the media in which it may exist) necessary to support or validate a research project’s observations, findings or outputs, or which is required for legal or regulatory compliance.\\n\\n## 2. Responsibilities of the University\\n\\n2.1 The University will provide:\\n\\nsupport, advice and information to researchers on all aspects of research data management\\nsuitable infrastructure to facilitate the appropriate management, archiving and sharing of research data.\\ntraining and guidance to promote best practice in research data management.\\n\\n2.2 In order to support and enable this policy, the University is committed to engaging with researchers to fulfil the mutual responsibilities. The university will endeavour to provide research data management services and infrastructure capabilities which are adequate and fit for the purpose of supporting researchers’ compliance with the policy, particularly for academic staff and PGRs with externally funded research projects.\\n\\n2.3 The University has set an archiving period of no less than 10 years for all externally funded research data.\\n\\n## 3. Responsibilities of the researcher\\n\\n3.1 Principal Investigators (unless a defined role of data manager is assigned within the project group) are required to prepare a data management plan (DMP) which describes the data management life cycle for the data to be collected and processed by a research project. DMPs are usually required as part of research proposals for external funding and the University encourages similar best practice for internally funded projects. DMPs should include information on:\\n\\nthe handling of research data during and after the end of the project\\nwhat data will be collected, processed and/or generated\\nwhich methodology and standards will be applied\\nwhether data will be shared/made open access and\\nhow data will be curated and preserved (including after the end of the project)\\n\\n3.2 Principal Investigators (unless a defined role of data manager is assigned within the project group) hold day-to-day responsibility for the effective management of research data generated within or obtained from their research, including by their research groups. This shall include understanding and complying with the requirements of any relevant contract with or grant to the University that includes provisions regarding the ownership, preservation and dissemination of research data.\\n\\n3.3 Researchers will protect confidential, personal and sensitive personal research data in accordance with legal and ethical requirements related to the research they conduct.\\n\\n3.4 Researchers will make every reasonable effort to keep an accurate and comprehensive record of their research, including documenting clear procedures for the collection, storage, use, reuse, access and retention or deletion of the research data associated with their records. Where appropriate, this should include defining and documenting protocols and responsibilities in collaborative research projects.\\n\\n3.4 Researchers will make every reasonable effort to recognise Intellectual Property arising from their research activities and manage that Intellectual Property according to any funder requirements or contractual obligations.\\n\\n3.5 Researchers will preserve and provide appropriate access to their research data supporting outputs after the end of their project for as long as it has continuing value, in accordance with legal and funder requirements and paying due regard to discipline norms and cost. Notwithstanding, the minimum retention period for research data and records is ten years after publication or public release of the work of the research. School Research Ethics Committees can consider and approve proposals from PIs to retain data for shorter periods of time where reasoned arguments are provided e.g. where individuals participating in the research may be put at significant risk of identification.\\n\\n3.6 Researchers should deposit their data in an appropriate data repository along with sufficient descriptive metadata (a data record) to ensure that it can be found and understood. Where academic staff deposit data somewhere other than the University’s institutional data repository (the University of Huddersfield Research Portal), a metadata record should still be created in the portal which describes and points to the data.\\n\\n3.7 Published papers which rely on data generated by the authors should include a data access statement even where there are no data associated with the article or the data are inaccessible, In line with UKRI policy on Open access. Authors should also apply good data citation principles and formally cite data which has directly informed the conclusions drawn in their papers.\\n\\n3.8 Researchers are responsible for agreeing arrangements (with their Research Centre Director or nominee) as to where their research data will be stored and who will have access to this after they leave (or retire from) the University.  The researcher’s department or School reserves the right to retain a copy of the data for an appropriate period to ensure compliance with any legal or regulatory responsibilities, and/or research grant or contractual requirements.\\n\\n3.9 Researchers can obtain advice and support from the Research Data Management Team (rdm@hud.ac.uk) team.\\n\\n## 4.

The University of Hull is committed to the delivery of high-quality research and both requires and fosters the practice of research to high standards across all disciplines.  The University has laid out its expectations in the Statement on Research Integrity (2023), Code of Good Research Practice (2023), and Research Ethics Policy (2023).\\n2. A key element of this delivery is the dissemination of the outputs from research to communicate the research findings to the widest possible audience and achieve a broad societal impact.  This dissemination recognises that the outputs from research are valuable assets meriting curation to support ongoing access and are a major component of the knowledge legacy generated by the University.\\n3. Whilst acknowledging the primary focus of attention on publications as outputs from research, the University also recognises the intrinsic value of data generated through research.  Research data underpin the research process and provide the core basis of the research analysis that feeds into publications and other dissemination activity.\\n4. The effective management of research data contributes to research integrity by ensuring that the analysis disseminated through research outputs has a sound basis.  It also contributes to a culture of honesty and accuracy in research practice and underpins research reproducibility by facilitating transparency in research practice.\\n\\n### Purpose\\n\\n5. The purpose of this policy is to establish principles for effective management of the research data generated within the University plus its dissemination, through sharing of this data where appropriate.  The policy provides the link between research practice and the data it produces, the management and curation of research data, including legal criteria that need attention, sharing research data with others, and the responsibilities that stakeholders in the research process have to ensure success in working with research data.\\n6. This policy seeks to support adherence with funder and journal policies related to research data. It is recognised that these policies continue to evolve, and supporting guidance will be adjusted to meet changing requirements as needed.\\n\\n### Scope\\n\\n7. This policy applies to all research carried out at the University of Hull, whether conducted by staff or students, funded externally or by the University (respecting where contracts with private funders may have specific requirements).  The policy does not apply to data gathered through regular business and administrative activity of the University, although it is recognised that the principles and practice detailed in this and related documents may also be of benefit in ensuring effective management of data in those areas.\\n8. The policy applies to data that are both digital and non-digital.\\n9. The principles of the policy can be used to inform the management of research data created at any time, but the policy itself applies to research data created from the date of implementation of this policy.\\n\\n### Context\\n\\n10. The policy has been developed in the context of external guidance within the research community.  In particular, the policy is aligned to the following documents:\\n\\na. The FAIR Guiding Principles (2016),  \\nb. The UKRI Common Principles on Data Policy (updated 2022),  \\nc. The Concordat on Open Research Data (2016),  \\n\\n11. This policy sets out principles that apply across all areas of research.  It is recognised that there will be disciplinary norms and differences in the definition and understanding of research data, and its management and sharing.  Where there are specific disciplinary data management requirements, these should be acknowledged and accommodated within the research data management and sharing practice carried out.\\n\\n### Definitions\\n\\n12. Research data – For the purposes of this policy, and acknowledging disciplinary differences in interpretation, research data refer to any material collected, observed, constructed, generated, or created for the purpose of research analysis, and on which research conclusions are based1.\\n\\n13. Data management plan – A data management plan (DMP) is a document that records intentions to gather, store, manage, disseminate and preserve research data.  A DMP provides a methodology for working with data through a research process, and as a checklist to ensure the maintenance and development of good practice over time.\\n\\n14. Data curation – Data curation involves the active management of research data to maintain, preserve and add value to the data throughout its lifetime.\\n\\n15. Data catalogue – A data catalogue is a record of the existence of datasets, with each being described using a metadata record (which may be brief or detailed according to the complexity of the data).\\n\\n16. Data repository – A data repository is a location or service that can be used to preserve, curate and share research data over time.  Its focus is on preserving final datasets after the research generating the data has been completed, though snapshots of data being added to over time can also be included.\\n\\n17. Data sharing – Data sharing in the context of this policy involves making research data available for others to utilise, through deposit in a data repository with an open licence, or a private arrangement with an individual or team.   A key part of sharing data is the creation of suitable metadata or data documentation describing the data to facilitate access and understanding about the data.\\n\\n18. Data access statement – A statement of the way(s) in which research data can be accessed. This may range from provision of a web link to a downloadable file to contact details to support a conversation about how data might be made available (e.g., if the files are large).  A data access statement may also be used to indicate why access is not available, for instance if data is sensitive or the rights-holder unknown.\\n\\n### Principles\\n\\n#### Research practice\\n\\n19. Where research data contains personal or sensitive information, the management of the data must be included in the ethical approval for the research in accordance with the Research Ethics Policy.\\n20. Managing research data is a key researcher skill alongside other research skills (See Principle #9 in the Concordat on Open Research Data): the University will provide training to enable researchers to develop this skill and put it into practice.\\n21. Research induction and continuing researcher professional development must include reference to research data management and this policy so staff and students are aware of the requirements upon them.\\n22. In keeping with wider research practice, the use of ORCID identifiers for researchers is recommended to assist with the effective management and sharing of research data.\\n\\n#### Managing data\\n\\nThe management of research data is a task carried out by all researchers in all disciplines to some degree.  This policy highlights the benefits of a structured approach to that task.\\n\\n23.  A vital element of the management process is the development of a data management plan (DMP).  All research projects must create a DMP relevant to the needs of the project as part of their documentation for the project.  DMPs are working documents and should be updated in line with project developments; each version should be preserved alongside other project documentation.\\n24. The amount of research data being generated will vary from project to project.  In each case researchers must at an early stage assess the scale of the data and make suitable arrangements for it to be stored and backed up.  Where IT storage services will be used, early communication with IT Services must be undertaken to inform appropriate practice based on requirements.\\n25. Where the research data constitutes or includes software, the software should be maintained through an appropriate code repository to facilitate management and support reproducibility.\\n26. Research planning should account for any costs associated with managing data, including its storage and staff time involved.  Where funders can provide support for such costs, or a proportion of them, this should be included in grant applications.\\n27. Research data should be managed in keeping with best current practice for data curation, acknowledging disciplinary norms as part of this.  This should include assignment of a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) or other appropriate persistent identifier to datasets for discoverability and citation.\\n28. All data management plans must give consideration to the date of expiry for the data, which, unless there are specific funder requirements otherwise, must not exceed seven years from the date of deposit.  All data reaching their expiry date or the seven-year limit must be reviewed by appropriate academic and professional services staff to inform future management, or agree on deletion of the data.\\n29. Completed research datasets generated by the University must have a metadata record created within the current research information system (CRIS), linked to the project(s) that produced it, providing a data catalogue; this will include data stored locally at the University and data stored at third party services externally.  Where data is deleted, the record must be kept, but updated to record when the deletion took place.\\n\\n30. Non-digital data will require specific management according to the type of data involved.  The precise arrangements for such management must be incorporated within the DMP for the research in question.\\n\\n### Sharing data\\n\\n31. In keeping with the value inherent in open access to research outputs, publishing data with an open licence is an aim for all research at the University.  This policy recognises that there are occasionally valid reasons why data cannot be made open, and these reasons must be recorded as part of the data catalogue record.  Licence choice must take account of associated funder requirements.\\n32. Researchers involved in the creation of the data have the right to exploit the data for an agreed period prior to sharing it (see Principle #4 in the Concordat on Open Research Data and Point 5 in the UKRI Common Principles on Data Policy).  Guidance from funders and/or subject communities should be followed on the length of such a period: where no such guidance is available a locally agreed time limit that takes account of disciplinary practice will be applied.\\n33. When data is being shared it must have an extended metadata record describing what the dataset contains to facilitate access and use.  Additional data documentation should be provided where appropriate to facilitate utilization of the data.\\n34. Where research data is referenced in publications, a data access statement must be included.\\n35. Where research data is sourced externally and used within research at the University, it must be appropriately referenced as an acknowledged source in any publications arising from the research.  Research data generated at the University must be citeable by others using the metadata in the CRIS record (see paragraphs 30/31): this metadata must include the DOI or other appropriate persistent identifier assigned to aid discovery.\\n36. Research data can be shared through an appropriate data repository, which may be local or via a third-party service: where possible this repository should have trusted digital repository (TDR) status.  If the latter option is chosen, the service should adhere to the principles within this policy.\\n\\n### Legal2\\n\\n37. All data created through research at the University by employees is owned by the University, unless there are contractual arrangements that specify otherwise.\\n38. Researchers who leave the University should ensure that access to a copy of the data, whether at the University or at a third party, is available prior to leaving: details of such access must be recorded in the DMP for a dataset, which must be stored and made available alongside other project documentation.\\n39. Students may own the data they generate, dependent on the source of their funding, but must clarify this and any shared ownership and authorship the University may claim with staff/supervisors at an early stage in the research process and record this within the DMP.\\n40. Where research data is shared for dissemination, an appropriate licence must be applied to facilitate access and usage by others.\\n41. Conversely, data sourced externally must be used in accordance with any licensing attached to this.  Exclusive rights to reuse or publish research data must not be handed over to commercial publishers or agents.\\n42. Research data must be managed in accordance with the University’s Data Protection Policy3, and specifically the Data Principles within paragraph 6 of that Policy. It is acknowledged that legislative requirements may alter over time and that data management and sharing must take account of such changes as they occur.\\n43. Data must be held securely and used only for the purpose that has been consented.\\n44. Care must be taken over who has access to such data, and details of such access rights recorded in the DMP.\\n\\n### Responsibilities\\n\\n#### Overall responsibility\\n\\nThe management of research data is a collaborative activity that involves multiple stakeholders across the University.  It is recognised that only through working together can the University effectively achieve the principles outlined in this document.\\n\\n45. Primary responsibility for the management and sharing of data in accordance with the principles set out in this policy lies with the Principal Investigator (PI) or supervisor for the research being carried out.  Details of how this responsibility is exercised must be recorded within the DMP. Where the PI leaves the University, responsibility should be delegated to an appropriate colleague: if no such delegation takes place responsibility for the data will be the responsibility of the PI’s School or Institute.\\n\\n#### Heads of School/Directors of Institute responsibilities\\n\\n46. It is the responsibility of Heads of School/Directors of Institutes to ensure good practice and legal obligations are met relating to the management and sharing of research data within their area.\\n47. Heads of School/Directors of Institutes should identify and arrange for any training or skills development required in carrying out the above responsibility and in support of PIs in exercising their responsibilities.\\n\\n#### Ethics Committees\\n\\n48. Ethics Committees are responsible for ensuring that where projects make use of or generate research data that requires management under the terms of the Research Ethics Policy that the project has established the research data management practice required for ethical clearance.\\n\\n#### Researcher responsibilities (where researcher is an employee)\\n\\n49. Researchers are responsible for ensuring that research data they work with is managed, and shared where appropriate, in accordance with the principles set out in this policy.\\n50. Researchers must make every reasonable effort to keep an accurate and comprehensive record of their research and associated research data in keeping with the Code for Good Research Practice, to demonstrate good practice and underpin adherence to the principles of this policy.\\n\\n51. Researchers must ensure that research data management and sharing carried out under the aegis of collaborative projects, involving partners external to the University, is suitably documented to make clear the University’s responsibilities during and beyond the project’s lifetime in respect of the data generated from the collaboration.\\n\\n#### Postgraduate research student and supervisor responsibilities\\n\\n52. It is the responsibility of postgraduate research students and their supervisors to ensure that research data management is planned and documented at the outset of the research project to fully inform work with research data during and beyond the period of doctoral study.\\n\\n#### University responsibilities\\n\\n53. Supporting responsibilities lie mainly with three areas of the University: Research and Innovation Office, University Library, and IT Services.  Between these services areas they are responsible for:\\n\\na. Advising on funder requirements for data management and sharing as part of grant applications.\\nb. Support in the development of DMPs for such grant applications and their maintenance and development during research.\\nc. Communication and coordination of effort to identify data management needs as part of research development.\\nd. The delivery of appropriate training on data management and sharing.\\ne. Provision of guidance and advice on the curation and preservation of research data.\\nf. Guidance and support on the creation of appropriate metadata for research data to support the data catalogue and sharing.\\ng. Provision and support of appropriate systems, including storage, to meet the University’s research data needs.\\nh. Oversight of security within those systems to ensure the integrity and safekeeping of research data over time.\\ni. Management of contracts with external service suppliers where appropriate to help meet these research data needs.\\nj. Provision of data storage costs for inclusion in grant applications.\\n\\n### Reporting\\n\\n54. In keeping with Principle #10 of the Concordat on Open Research Data, review of this policy will take account of assessment of the progress towards the provision of research data by researchers at the University.',\n",

The University recognises the value of sharing research data openly where appropriate as a way to promote scholarly discourse and support learning and teaching and therefore aspires to be a leader in open data practices.\\n\\nThis policy is applicable to all staff and students and should be read in conjunction with the University's Code of Practice for Research, which reflects the principles and commitments outlined in the Concordat to Support Research Integrity, the University’s Open access publications policy and Research Ethics Policy.\\n\\nThe University of Lincoln recognises that the curation and sharing of research data is key to its mission to develop and create knowledge. This brings benefits to the University, its members and the public through greater opportunities for access and re-use. Research data is defined as data acquired or generated in the course of research undertaken at the University and its management refers to storage, preservation, discovery, and provision for access and re-use.\\n\\nThe University recognises and supports the UK Research & Innovation Common Principles1 on Data Policy mandates as best practice for data curation and sharing.\\n\\nThis policy aims to address the requirements of researchers, the public, funding and statutory bodies and commercial partners and set out the principles to ensure that research data will be managed, curated and shared to the highest standards throughout the research data lifecycle.\\n\\n1. Researchers should consider data creation, management and sharing in a ‘Data Management Plan (DMP)’ which should explicitly address data capture, protection, management, integrity, confidentiality, evaluation, retention, sharing and publication. DMPs should take into consideration compliance with relevant legislative frameworks which may limit public access to data (e.g. in areas of data protection (point 5), intellectual property and human rights). Further details on DMPs are available from the Digital Curation Centre2.\\n2. While a DMP, or its equivalent, is sometimes a requirement of the research funding, it is considered best practice for all research.\\n3. Responsibility for research data management through a sound DMP during any research project or programme lies primarily with the researchers.\\n4. The University will provide training, guidance and support for the development of DMPs or its equivalent and their implementation.\\n5. Where research data may contain personal information about identifiable individuals, the relevant data protection laws must be considered and a Data Protection Impact\\n\\nAssessment (DPIA) may need to be conducted in collaboration with the University’s Data Compliance Officer prior to any personal data being collected.\\n\\n6. Researchers should record the existence of research data upon creation or access and deposit it according to their plan. This should be in compliance with timeframes for preserving access that are part of the external contract (often within six months of publication of research findings).\\n\\n7. Research metadata will be published (where appropriate) for permanent citation in the Lincoln Repository alongside conventional outputs such as journal articles and conference papers where appropriate.\\n\\n8. Access to research data will be granted under appropriate safeguards according to conditions and timeframes specified by researchers, commercial partners and funding bodies.\\n\\n9. It is the responsibility of the researcher to ensure all research data that support and substantiate published research findings are offered to an appropriate repository for long term storage and public access, where permitted. This may be funder or discipline specific, or, where no external repository has been identified, may be within University storage facilities.\\n\\nThe University aims to provide the infrastructure and expertise for long-term curation, preservation and access to research data. This includes secure services for storage, backup, registration, deposit and retention of research data assets in support of current and future access, during and after completion of research projects.\\n\\nCosts to meet the specific requirements of Data Management Plans should be included in grant applications, where permitted. The University will develop appropriate plans and budgets for meeting the costs of long-term storage, preservation and curation of research data.\",\n",

Introduction\\n\\n1.1 The University of Liverpool recognises that the effective management of research data is an integral part of good research practice. It is essential for data integrity as well as safeguarding and handling data responsibly in accordance with ethical, legal, and regulatory requirements. Good data management underpins research integrity, transparency, and reproducibility by ensuring data associated with research outputs are documented, preserved, and accessible, thereby allowing for the verification of research results.\\n\\n1.2 Good management also facilitates data sharing which maximises the reuse of research data, the benefits of which include promoting the work of researchers, fostering collaboration, increased resource efficiency, and securing public trust. The University promotes compliance with relevant funder and publisher policies and supports the Concordat on Open Research Data, and UKRI\\'s Common Principles on research data. The University acknowledges there are valid reasons data may not, or cannot, be shared such as where a contract is in place or data are sensitive. The University endorses Horizon Europe\\'s principle that data should be \"as open as possible as closed as necessary\" and follow FAIR Principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable).\\n\\n## 2. Purpose\\n\\n2.1 The purpose of this policy is to promote good management of research data with the aim of making it openly available where possible so that university research can have the greatest potential impact.\\n\\n2.2 This policy outlines the expectations and responsibilities of both researchers and the University to support best practice in research data management, the preservation of research data and research related records, and sharing research data.\\n\\n2.3 The aims of this policy are to:\\n\\n1. Promote best practice in research data management together with FAIR Principles to ensure research data are managed in a way that maximises their reproducibility and long-term accessibility.\\n2. Support researchers to make their research data as open as possible in a responsible and timely manner.\\n3. Outline the roles and responsibilities of researchers and the University in supporting good research data management.\\n\\n## 3. Scope\\n\\n3.1 This policy applies to all research regardless of whether it is externally funded and is subject to the provisions of any relevant contracts including funding agreements.\\n\\n3.2 It applies to all staff, including technical staff, visiting researchers, individuals on honorary contracts, and post graduate research (PGR) students engaged in research, hereafter referred to as researchers.\\n\\n3.3 Statements 5.3.8, 6.1, 6.3, 6.5 apply to taught course students who have obtained ethical approval and supervisors of those students. However, all students are encouraged to adopt best practice in research data management since all those engaged in academic work have a personal responsibility to contribute to research integrity.\\n\\n3.3 This policy covers the management of all research data (active and archive data) collected during the course of research regardless of format, and research related records. It also covers the sharing of research data.\\n\\n3.4 The retention of research related records, records documenting the conduct of research projects, including documents such as protocol, consent procedure, participants and adverse effects arising from research projects, research grant documentation, consent forms, contracts, etc. are covered by the University’s Information Management Policy.\\n\\n## 4. Definitions\\n\\nFor the purposes of this policy, the following terms are defined:\\n\\n4.1 Research: Broadly, this is an activity that leads to new insights and knowledge. There are a number of definitions for research, one being the Frascati definition that states “Research and experimental development (R&D) comprise creative work undertaken on a systematic basis in order to increase the stock of knowledge, including knowledge of humankind, culture and society, and the use of this stock of knowledge to devise new applications.”\\n\\n4.2 Researcher: Any individual who conducts research under the auspices of the University.\\n\\n4.3 Principal Investigator (PI): A researcher with overall responsibility for a research project. In clinical research where a project has a Chief Investigator (CI) as well as one or more Principal Investigators (PI), the CI has overall responsibility for the research project while each PI has responsibility for an individual recruiting site.\\n\\n4.4 Research Data: The University adopts the definition laid out in the Concordat on Open Research Data (p.3) which states that “research data are the evidence that underpins the answer to the research question, and can be used to validate findings regardless of form (e.g. print, digital, or physical)1. These might be quantitative information or qualitative statements collected by researchers in the course of their work by experimentation, observation, modelling, interview or other methods, or information derived from existing evidence. Data may be raw or primary (e.g. direct from measurement or collection) or derived from primary data for subsequent analysis or interpretation (e.g. cleaned up or as an extract from a larger data set), or derived from existing sources where the rights may be held by others.”\\n\\n4.5 Sponsor: A body that guarantees and oversees a research project or clinical trial, ensuring that there are proper arrangements in place to initiate, manage, monitor and finance a study. A Sponsor can be external to the University.\\n\\n4.6 Clinical Trials Unit (CTU): An academic specialised research unit with the purpose of designing, conducting, analysing, and publishing clinical trials and other studies. At Liverpool Clinical Trials Centre, the Director of the CTU is typically the data custodian and is responsible for ensuring the proper handling and security of trial data.\\n\\n4.7 Data Controller: The organisation responsible for data security and meeting data protection requirements.\\n\\n4.8 There are three main states of research data:\\n\\nActive data: “Live” project data regularly accessed and/or analysed as part of a research project.\\n\\nArchive data: End-of-project or finished data. These data are prepared for long-term preservation and archived for legal, regulatory, or contractual purposes. They may contain sensitive or personal information and might not be openly available. Some archive data may also be shared data.\\n\\nShared data: Research data that are made available for reuse. This may include restrictions or conditions of access and reuse.\\n\\n## 5. Responsibilities\\n\\n### 5.1 Statement of Responsibility\\n\\nResearchers are responsible for the management of their research data, but the University recognises that researchers cannot meet expectations for open research without support from the institution. The University also recognises that support for research data management falls to a variety of stakeholders across the institution, including, but not limited to: Libraries, Museums, and Galleries; IT Services; Information and Records Management; Research Support Office including Research Integrity and Research Ethics; Legal and Governance; Clinical Research Governance Team (Clinical Directorate); and Faculty Research and Impact Support.\\n\\n### 5.2 Responsibilities of the University\\n\\n5.2.1 The University is responsible for providing support and guidance to researchers on aspects of data management across the research lifecycle.\\n\\n5.2.2 The University is responsible for providing and promoting the availability and security of appropriate systems and infrastructure to facilitate good research data management and ensure researchers can meet expectations of relevant polices.\\n\\n5.2.3 The University will raise awareness and provide relevant training, materials, and research data management services to ensure researchers have the necessary resources and skills to manage their data to best practice standards and in accordance with relevant policies. See Section 6. Key expectations and guidance.\\n\\n### 5.3 Responsibilities of researchers\\n\\nFor associated guidance and resources, see Section 6. Key expectations and guidance.\\n\\n5.3.1 Researchers are responsible for familiarising themselves with the requirements of this Research Data Management Policy and any relevant legislation, policies, or contracts from research funders and other stakeholders.\\n\\n5.3.2 Individual researchers, or, in the case of collaborative research projects the Principal Investigator (PI) or Clinical Investigator (CI), are responsible for ensuring data management adheres to all relevant policies including complying with legal, ethical, or regulatory frameworks governing the processing and safeguarding of personal and sensitive research data. In the case of Clinical Trials or Sponsored research, the Sponsor will delegate the task of data management to the CI, and will retain oversight of the study. Relevant policies include, but are not limited to, the University’s Policy on Research Integrity, Data Protection Policy, Information Security Policy, IT Acceptable Use Policy and the Freedom of Information Policy.\\n\\n5.3.3 The PI has overall day-to-day responsibility for the effective management of research data and research related records including delegating responsibility for data management to co-investigators or other project members where appropriate and ensuring all project members are informed of data-related decisions. For Clinical Trials or Sponsored research, the Sponsor is responsible for delegating data management tasks.\\n\\n5.3.4 Researchers are responsible for the effective management of research data and research related records and making appropriate decisions about data collection, processing, storage, safeguarding, archiving, and data sharing in their field. An accurate and comprehensive record of the research should be kept including documenting standards, protocols, and responsibilities.\\n\\n5.3.5 Researchers are responsible for ensuring all required governance approvals including ethical approval and sponsorship is obtained for applicable research projects before any\\n\\ndata collection has begun in line with relevant policies including the University’s Policy on Research Ethics, Human Materials Research Policy, Clinical Trials of Investigational Medicinal Products Sponsored by the University and the Sponsorship of Research Policy.\\n\\n5.3.6 Researchers are responsible for making appropriate appraisal decisions for the retention, transference of ownership, or destruction of research data at the end of the project and/or when they leave the University. These decisions should consider legal or funder requirements as well as the University’s Information Management Policy and Records Retention Schedule.\\n\\n5.3.7 In the case of postgraduate research (PGR) projects, overall responsibility for ensuring data are managed in line with relevant policies lies with the PGR’s supervisor. PGRs are responsible for the day-to-day management of the data including writing the ethics application (where applicable) which should be shared with their academic supervisor or PI. PGRs and their supervisors are also subject to the PGR Code of Practice.\\n\\n5.3.8 In the case of undergraduate and postgraduate taught course (PGT) students undertaking research, the responsibility lies with the student’s supervisor or PI for ensuring resulting research data are managed in line with relevant policies, including the University’s Policy on Research Ethics, Information Security Policy, IT Acceptable Use Policy, and the Programme Terms and Conditions. Data acquired in undergraduate or taught postgraduate projects will not normally be retained. It is the responsibility of the PI or supervisor to ensure that any research data collected during such projects is deleted at the end of the project except in exceptional circumstances including but not limited to where legal or regulatory requirements are in place or research findings are included in published outputs.\\n\\n## 6. Key expectations and guidance\\n\\n### 6.1 Data Management Plans\\n\\nAll research projects are expected to have an associated Data Management Plan (DMP) and clearly document data collection, storage, security, access, ownership, retention, deletion, sharing, and reuse. The DMP should be completed before ethical approval is sought.\\n\\nGuidance and training for DMPs as well as best practice for managing research data throughout the project can be found on the Library’s Research Data Management Essentials web pages. Further support can be sought from the Research Data Management Team.\\n\\n### 6.2 Compliance and contracts\\n\\nWhere a research project is conducted with other institutions or independent researchers, all parties should comply with existing agreements and contracts. Obligations should be documented, and parties should agree a plan for managing the data generated during the study. University of Liverpool researchers are responsible for the management and security of any research data held by the University of Liverpool. For Clinical Trials or Sponsored research where the Clinical Trials Unit or Sponsor is external to the University, the security of any research data is not the formal responsibility of the University of Liverpool. In these cases, responsibility for data security lies with the designated data controller. It is best practice to have e.g. a research contract, collaboration agreement, confidentiality agreement, joint data controllership agreement, and/or data sharing agreement in place before the project begins.\\n\\nContractual support is provided by the Research Contracts team.\\n\\n### 6.3 Ethical approval\\n\\nEthical approval must be in place for all relevant research projects before data collection has begun.\\n\\nResearchers can consult the University’s Research Ethics Decision Tool for guidance to determine whether University research ethics approval will be needed for their study.\\n\\n### 6.4 Health and Social Care research\\n\\nResearch projects that are being undertaken within the remit of the UK Policy Framework for Health and Social Care Research must have an identified Sponsor before the study can begin. This research also requires review by a Health Research Authority (HRA) Research Ethics Committee (REC). Transfer of research data between the University of Liverpool and partner NHS Trusts must be controlled appropriately and detailed within the protocol and Data Management Plan.\\n\\nThe University Sponsorship team can provide advice on such research. Researchers should be aware that access to this data can be requested and requires a written request through the Sponsorship team.\\n\\n### 6.5 Data storage\\n\\nThe University expects all active research data to be stored within University centrally managed IT facilities and services, using University managed devices as per the IT Acceptable Use Policy. Centrally contracted and managed IT facilities and services align with the University’s Data Protection Policy and Information Security Policy.\\n\\nThe Information Protection Guide underpins the Information Security Policy and provides support on classifying and protecting information throughout its lifecycle.\\n\\nA list of storage options and guidance for choosing the most appropriate service can be found on the Knowledge Base article Where can I store my research data (KB0012515).\\n\\nBy exception, where University centrally managed storage is deemed not suitable for the research project, the PI should discuss their requirements with relevant subject experts including, but not limited to, Research IT and Information Security via the IT Services self-service portal.\\n\\n### 6.6 Data ownership, Copyright, and Intellectual Property\\n\\nResearchers are expected to be clear about data ownership and/or terms and conditions of use at the beginning of the project (see also section 3.1 of the Information Security Policy). Unless specified by a research funder or other contract, such as in the case of collaborative projects with external organisations or where using third-party or secondary data, data ownership is outlined in the University’s Intellectual Property Policy. Researchers are expected to recognise Intellectual Property (IP) arising from their research activities and manage that Intellectual Property according to any funder requirements, contractual obligations, or in line with the University’s Intellectual Property Policy.\\n\\nContact the Enterprise Team (internal staff only) for advice on IP related matters.\\n\\n### 6.7 End-of-project\\n\\nAt the end of a research project, an assessment of which data must be retained and which data are destroyed should be undertaken. Data should be disposed of or retained (archived) in accordance with relevant requirements. Where no such funder or other contractual requirements exist, retention should follow the University’s Records Retention Schedule.\\n\\nGuidance on managing research records, as well as help with various other topics, can be found on the Information and Records Management webpages and via the Information and Records Management Guidance Index (internal staff only and via Microsoft 365). Contact the Information and Records Management team for further support.\\n\\n### 6.8 Open access to research data\\n\\nResearch data should be made openly available with their associated metadata in line with any relevant research funder or publisher policies. Where no policy exists, researchers are encouraged to share data underpinning research publications or of long-term value under the Horizon Europe principle “as open as possible, as closed as necessary”. Data should be shared in an appropriate manner (e.g. anonymised), with as few restrictions as possible, and in a timely manner.\\n\\nContact the Library’s Research Data Management Team for support and guidance around Open Access to research data.\\n\\n### 6.9 FAIR data, discoverability, and accessibility\\n\\nData and accompanying documentation and metadata should follow FAIR Principles to facilitate the discoverability and reuse of the data. Data should be deposited in an appropriate research repository such as the University of Liverpool’s Data Catalogue, a funder-mandated repository, or discipline specific repository with clear accessibility and reuse rights including an appropriate licence. Repositories should support the use of Open Research and Contributor IDs (ORCIDs) and Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs). Researchers are strongly encouraged to link datasets to their publication record using their author ORCID. A data access statement or citation should accompany any associated output or publication.\\n\\nInformation and support on ORCID can be found on the Library’s Open Research webpages and by contacting the Open Research Team.\\nContact the Library’s Research Data Management Team for support and guidance for data sharing including FAIR principles, identifying a suitable repository, and choosing an appropriate licence.',\n",

The University of London is committed to promoting the highest standards of academic research, including excellence in research data management.\\n\\n2. The University is developing services and guidance for its academic and research community in order to foster best practice in data management and to facilitate free and timely open access to data so that they are intelligible, assessable and useable by others.\\n\\n3. The University acknowledges legal and ethical constraints with regard to sharing data and the need to preserve the academic entitlement to publication as the primary communication of research results.\\n\\n4. This Policy aims to support the University to comply with funders’ requirements.\\n\\n5. This Policy is part of the University Data Management Governance Policy. It is in particular an integral part of the Code of Good Practice in Research and is linked to other Research policies, available here   This Policy is to be read in conjunction with the Research Data Management Guidance.\\n\\n## 2. Scope\\n\\n1. This Policy applies to all staff, students and fellows of the University engaged in studies or research solely or in collaborations with others. It also applies to visitors, individuals, collaborators conducting research or other studies in the name of the University. It extends to cover consultancy work and sponsored academic research. Persons meeting this specification shall be referred to as ‘Researchers.’ This Policy also applies to all University staff who support University’s Researchers throughout the research projects and outputs lifecycle. This Policy does not apply to any independent researchers, who do not have any association with the University.\\n\\n2. This Policy aims to aid the University academic and research community, as well as support services to adhere to the rules and mandates of its funding and regulatory bodies and to ensure that research data are maintained and preserved as identifiable, retrievable, and reusable assets as part of the overall research project cycle. This is achieved by establishing clear guidance on research data process and research outputs lifecycle, including repository and preservation, as well as allocating roles and responsibilities across the institution.\\n\\n3. This Policy applies to all data generated through research undertaken under the University’s aegis, solely or in collaboration with others. This includes, but is not limited to, research sponsored by grants or contracts awarded to the University and where the University is a partner on awards held by other institutions. This Policy does not include commercial and information management data.\\n\\n4. This Policy is to be reviewed every three years by the University Research Committee, which may decide to develop additional policies or guidance as code of practices across the UK and worldwide evolve.\\n\\n### 3. Definitions\\n\\n1. Research data is a valuable resource in its own right. It validates research findings and has long-term value as a potential resource for future research and teaching. The University is committed to the definition of Research data as outlined in the Concordat on Open Research Data, which covers all data across disciplines:\\n\\nResearch Data are the evidence that underpins the answer to the research question and can be used to validate findings regardless of its form (e.g., print, digital, or physical).\\n\\n### 2. Research Data:\\n\\nData that are collected, observed, generated, created, or obtained from commercial, government or other sources, for subsequent analysis and synthesis to produce original research results.\\n\\n3. Shareable Research Data: Research Data that must be preserved for long-term storage and shared.\\n\\n4. Data Management Plan (DMP): Plans typically state what data will be created and how, and outline the plans for protecting against loss, sharing and preservation, noting what is appropriate given the nature of the data and any restrictions that may need to be applied.\\n\\n5. Data Repository:\\n\\nA place where data may be stored and made available. This includes but is not limited to the University Repository, a discipline specific repository, or a funder repository.\\n\\n6. Funder:\\n\\nAn organisation that provides a financial contribution to support a research project.\\n\\n7. Researcher:\\n\\nThe person ultimately responsible for the research project. The Researcher takes responsibility for the intellectual leadership of the research project and the overall scientific and financial management of the research.\\n\\n8. Digital Object Identifier (DOI):\\n\\nA reference that enables permanent identification and location of digital objects, such as datasets and journal articles. This means a reference to a dataset elsewhere (e.g., in the journal article it supports or in the University’s repository catalogue) is not going to break or become outdated as a web address might do.\\n\\n## 4. Research Data Management\\n\\n1. The University is committed to good practice in research data management that supports and enhances the public value of its research by:\\n\\na. enabling the publication, sharing and citation of research datasets.\\nb. maximizing the impact of scholarly outputs.\\nc. enhancing the public visibility of funded research.\\nd. facilitating the reuse of data by future researchers.\\ne. avoiding duplication of data collection.\\nf. reducing the risk of data loss and corruption.\\ng. reducing the vulnerability of data due to file and software obsolescence.\\nh. enabling greater scrutiny of published research to affirm the robustness of findings.\\n\\n2. Research data should be managed to agreed standards throughout the research data lifecycle which include:\\n\\na. Ensuring research data collection, retention, storage, and accessibility conforms to the highest ethical standards.\\nb. Complying with all relevant internal and external policies, procedures, and codes and with funders’ requirements; in case of conflict with the University Policy, the policies of the funders take precedence unless specified.\\nc. Complying with all relevant licence agreements; in case of conflict with the University Policy, the terms and conditions of any licence agreements take precedence.\\nd. Being organised in a cohesive way, following the University’s records management standards to ensure the data can be appropriately recognised within University’s infrastructure. Evidence of legal and ethical considerations and approval (for e.g.: copyrights, release forms) is kept with the research data.\\nj. Publication of research data should be made available as rapidly and effectively as possible via deposit in an appropriate repository at or around the time of publication of the research findings.\\nk. Deposit and preservation in the University’s repository and appropriate national or international data service or domain repository, as specified by the funder, to facilitate dissemination and re-use.\\nl. Clear contact points for data protected under the Data Protection Act.\\n3. All Research Data should have a Data Management Plan (DMP), which would establish a clear workflow of technical, academic, and other organisational requirements attached to the data, and can be used as a point of reference throughout the data lifecycle.\\n4. All shareable research data are to be made publicly available for 10 years after publication or for the minimum period required by the funder if longer than 10 years. Researchers should ensure that the research data has a unique digital identifier (DOI) which is recognised nationally and internationally and would outlive any URLs or service provider changes. Maintenance and preservation of the research data are reviewed regularly by the University to ensure compliance within its infrastructure.\\n\\n## 5. Roles and Responsibilities\\n\\nThis Policy relies on a collaborative share of responsibilities to appropriately manage research data throughout its lifecycle.\\n\\n1. The University of London is committed to:\\n\\na. build a cohesive and expert support service that puts Researchers at its centre, by engaging with all stakeholders to encourage continuous improvement of this Policy.\\nb. meet legislative, funder, information governance and University requirements.\\nc. facilitate data security (confidentiality, integrity, availability).\\nd. facilitate appropriate access, collaboration and sharing of data and results.\\ne. develop appropriate preservation of its research data through the development of a preservation policy.\\nf. provide appropriate training, guidance, and tools to support Researchers and support staff with their tasks.\\ng. provide appropriate training, support, and guidance on legal and ethical considerations of data management.\\nh. maintain an institutional asset list.\\ni. communicate its standards, policies, and procedures to all its members through education and training, publication of this and related policies and procedures.\\nj. monitor and review the implementation of this Policy.\\n\\n2. The Researcher is committed to:\\n\\na. hold the responsibility for the effective management of their research data generated within or obtained for their research.\\nb. be responsible for identifying and preserving all their research data (whether shareable or not) that would be required to validate published research findings in the future.\\nc. endorse and integrate the University’s policies and guidance within the management of their research project.\\nd. take part in the provided training.\\n\\ne. seek University support when creating a Data Management plan and throughout the lifecycle of the projects to ensure research data are managed and shared appropriately and help maintain the institutional asset list. deposit the shareable research data in the University’s repository in the first instance but retain the right to deposit elsewhere (for e.g., per funders’ requirements). This should happen no later than the time of publication of the findings.\\n\\n3. If the Researcher leaves the University (such as death, incapacitation or leaving academia) or circumstances mean the researcher is no longer able to fulfil their responsibilities then:\\n\\nIf there is a Co-Investigator at the University, they inherit the\\nresponsibilities of the main principal investigator of the project.\\nIf the Researcher and the award move to another institution, the responsibilities follow the Researcher.\\nOtherwise, whom so ever is appointed by the department to complete any of the Researcher’s requirements for the research project will inherit the responsibilities outlined in this section.\\n\\n## 6.

       " '# Research Data Management Policy\\n\\n## 1. Preamble\\n\\nThe definitions of “research data” and of “affiliates of the University of Milan” that are considered for the purposes of this Policy are specified in the attached document N.1.\\n\\nThe University of Milan acknowledges the fundamental importance of research data as valuable scientificresults. Therefore, the University recognizes the relevance of records management for supporting the principles of quality and integrity in scientific research and is committed to pursuing the highest standardsof data collection, storage and preservation.\\n\\nThe University of Milan adheres to the principles of Open Science and in particular it encourages and protects the sharing of scientific publications and data produced by its staff with public funding according to the \"as open as possible as closed as necessary\" principle.  In particular, the University of Milan encourages the sharing of scientific data according to the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) paradigm.\\n\\nThe University of Milan acknowledges that reliable and easily retrievable research data are the foundation of every research project and that they are necessary for the verification of the soundness and reliability of research methods and results as well as for their reproducibility.\\n\\nThe University of Milan recognizes that research data are the heritage of universities once the scientific project that produced them is concluded and represent – in the long term as well – a precious resource for research, teaching and, in turn, the progression of society.\\n\\n## 2. Scope\\n\\nThis policy applies to all research activities of the University of Milan that produce data. In the event that the research has been funded by third parties and/or there are specific agreements regarding the collection, processing and management of data, their access and storage. It is maintained that the agreements must comply with existing legal and contractual provisions.\\n\\n### 3. Handling research data\\n\\nIn compliance with the current legislation on the protection of personal data1 and intellectual property, as well as with the provisions contained in the Statute and regulations of the University of Milan, and without prejudice to specific research funding agreements with third parties and/or other agreements with third parties, research data are managed and, in relation to publication, are stored and made freely available for use for the purposes of scientific and historical research or public interest, according to the principle \"as open as possible as closed as necessary\". Research data shall be archived as soon as possible and in any case no later than 30 days after the scientific publications describing them, without prejudice to specific indications by the Departments. The members of the University of Milan shall use software platforms that are suitable and, where required by the nature of the data, compliant with the regulations in force on the protection of personal data, preferably relying on the public archives of reference for the thematic area to which they belong. In particular, they will adhere to the \"good practices\" in data and metadata sharing promoted by the research infrastructures identified by ESFRI (European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures) as \"Landmarks\" for the various thematic areas and, in general, to compliance with the FAIR principles.\\n\\nThe University of Milan recognises that research data, even at the end of the scientific project that produced them, besides being an asset of the university institution, represent a resource - even in the long term - for research, university teaching and the progress of society. In general, research data must be collected, managed and archived in accordance with the standards in force in a correct, complete and reliable manner, respecting their integrity and documenting as comprehensively as possible the ways in which they were obtained in order to facilitate their reproducibility.\\n\\nThey must be made findable, accessible, interoperable and, where possible, available for subsequent use (FAIR principles).\\n\\nIf no third party rights, legal requirements or property laws prohibit it, research data can receive a freelicense for open use (for instance Creative Commons) granting traceability and credit to the originalsource.\\n\\nThe minimum archive duration for of the data storage period is 10 years.\\n\\nIn the event that it is necessary to destroy or delete all or part of the research data (e.g. for ethical or legal reasons)\\n\\n# UNIVERSITA DEGLI STUDI DI MILANO\\n\\nand without prejudice to the interests of third parties funding the research and of any third parties, this action must be traceable and the relevant documentation and justification transparent and accessible.\\n\\n### 4. Responsibilities, Rights, Duties\\n\\n1. The responsibility for research data collection, handling and maintenance storage is shared by the affiliates to the University of Milan and the University itself, each within its competence and jurisdiction and in compliance with the Ethical Code.\\n\\nAffiliates of the University of Milan are responsible for the management of research data and datasets, that is: .\\n\\nCollection, documentation, archiving, access, use and storage (or proper destruction) of research data and research-related records. This comprises the definition of protocols and responsibilities within a joint research project that must be included, as far as possible/required, in a Data Management Plan (DMP)2 Drafting and updating of the DMP (see Guidelines on and models of DMP provided by the University of Milan) and definition of the use of data rights after project completion. The identification and adoption of practices that ensure data security and integrity over time; Granting due acknowledgment (e.g. by inclusion among the authors of the publications describing them), both at individual and institution level, to those who have contributed to collecting, obtaining, and analysing data.\\n\\nIt is the task of the manager of a research project both to define which of the collected data are to be stored and shared and to ensure their proper handling by other project collaborators, also taking into account the duties resulting from contracts with third parties.\\n\\n2. The University of Milan is responsible for:\\n\\nAppointing support staff and providing affiliates with adequate resources, tools and infrastructures both, in terms of software and hardware for data storage and in compliance with this policy and to the legislation referred to.\\nProviding for assistance and support in the drafting of DMPs.\\nOffer training courses on research data management according to international standards\\nDevelop services to enable the deposit, archiving and preservation of research data and maintain their accessibility during and after the end of the research project\\nEnsure the conditions for the contents of the policy to be fully respected In order to guarantee the full application of the policy, taking into account the specificities of the individual areas and disciplinary fields, the departments shall adopt a policy on the management of research data which, in accordance with the University policy, shall guide their members in the use of the most appropriate data management and sharing tools for the specific discipline..\\nThe departmental policies on the management of research data will be made available to the University Open Science Commission, which will be able to suggest changes to the departments aimed at standardising and rationalising the management of data between related departments.\\n\\n### 5. Validity Date\\n\\nThe Research Data Management Policy entered into force on the 1 of October 2022 and will updated everytwo years.\\n\\nThe Academic Senate approved the policy on the 13th of September 2022.\\n\\n## Annex 1\\n\\n### Definition of research data\\n\\nResearch data are factual records, which may take the form of numbers, symbols, text, images or sounds, whichare used as primary sources for research, which are commonly accepted in the research community as necessary to validate research findings.\\n\\n### Definition of affiliates to the University of Milan to whom this policy applies\\n\\nProfessors, researchers, PhDs, research fellows, interns, technical and administrative personnel involved in research activities.\\n\\nIn support of the definition of research data employed in the Policy, three references are mentioned:\\n\\na) LERU Roadmap for Research Data (LERU Research Data Working Group, Advice Paper No. 14 – December 2014):\\n\\n“Research data, from the point of view of the institution with a responsibility for managing the data, includes: All data which is created by researchers in the course of their work, and for which the institution has a curationalresponsibility for at least as long as the code and relevant archives/record keeping acts require, and third-party data which have originated within the institution or come from elsewhere.”\\n\\nb) The Australian Griffith University:\\n\\n“Research data are factual records, which may take the form of numbers, symbols, text, images or sounds, which are used as primary sources for research, which are commonly accepted in the research community as necessary to validate research findings.”\\n\\n### The University of Minnesota:\\n\\n\"Research data are data in any format or medium that relate to or support research, scholarship, or artisticactivity. They can be classified as:\\n\\nRaw or primary data: information recorded as notes, images, video footage, paper surveys, computer files, etc. Processed data: analyses, descriptions, and conclusions prepared as reports or papers Published data: information distributed to people beyond those involved in data acquisition and administration\\n\\nImportant documents for policy evaluation:   Lists the principles that institutions should follow\\n\\n  collects the documentation relied upon for policy development (guidelines of the European project led by LERU)',\n",
       " '# UoN generic Data Management Plan guidance\\n\\nResearch Support Team\\n\\nNovember 2021\\n\\n## UoN Data Management Plan\\n\\nWrite 2-3 pages A4\\n\\n### Data description\\n\\nWhat data will you create?\\n\\nData Description: List the kinds of data or major datasets that you expect to create or use, noting its estimated volume/size, content, coverage or scope, and the types of the data (e.g., quantitative, qualitative, survey data, experimental measurements, models, images, audio-visual data, samples, documents, spreadsheets, databases, images, film, digital models, contents of an application, hardcopy records, physical collections or manuscripts, physical samples, or instrumental measurements etc.). Include the raw data arising directly from the research, the reduced data derived from it, and published data. Also, include non-digital data if relevant. Describe the types, volume, and scope of data that will be created and managed in the following terms: quantitative, qualitative, generated from surveys, clinical measurements, interviews, medical records, electronic health records, administrative records, genotypic data, images, tissue samples, etc.\\n\\nData volume: It is important to plan for the volume of data you plan to capture, process, and store. Think about the volume of primary and secondary data you will be producing as part of your research. This could be articulated in the anticipated (estimated) number of files you will generate, or the projected storage capacity you expect to require.\\n\\nData format: What file formats will you be making use of during your research? Do formats and software enable sharing and long-term validity of data? UKRI and other funders prefer “open” formats to “closed”, proprietary formats, whenever possible. Formats should also be considered to preserve the highest standard of data (so, tiff files would be preferable to compressed jpgs for storing images, for example), and for long-term archival use when possible (e.g. PDF/A, rather than generic PDF, is better suited to long-term archiving). Using propriety formats is acceptable if that is the most appropriate format for your research. State the format of the final dataset. Describe the file formats and software used, the number of records, databases, sweeps, repetitions… (in terms that are meaningful in your field).\\n\\n### Data collection and/or generation\\n\\nWhat are your methodologies for data collection / generation? How will you ensure data quality? What data standards will you use?\\n\\nDescribe how you will collect or generate your data and justify why new data collection is needed. Describe good practice and community standards for ensuring new data are of high quality and processing is well documented. How will consistency and quality of data collection / generation be controlled and documented? I.e., through processes of calibration, repeat samples or measurements, standardised data capture or recording, data entry validation, peer review of data or representation with controlled vocabularies?\\n\\nBefore embarking on a complex project to generate new data, you should assess existing datasets to ensure that nobody has already gathered this data, and that you are aware of similar relevant datasets that already exist. Provide references. [To locate potential datasets of use in your discipline, consult RE3Data.org]. You will need to justify creating new datasets if data relevant to your research is available. Consider how the data you plan to collect or create relates to existing datasets – identify gaps and relationships between currently available and required data.\\n\\nIf purchasing or reusing existing data sources, explain how you address issues such as cost and intellectual property. You should consider the licencing terms to access/re-use data, and what the terms of use are. Give an overview of any contracts or access/use agreements you will have to sign, and any restrictions on how the data might be used and shared.\\n\\nMethodologies: Outline the proposed methodologies you will use to collect or generate data, including software and tools for data collection, and which community data standards (if any) will be used to ensure the data is of high quality. Provide information on the new data: volume, type, and content. Explain how you will ensure (control and document) data quality and consistency (quality assurance), such as standardised data capture or recording, digitisation, data entry validation, peer review of data, calibration, repeat samples or measurements, representation using controlled vocabularies, use of a uniform interview method to maintain consistency in qualitative data collection, etc. Indicate how the data will be organised during the project, for example, naming conventions, version control, and folder structures.\\n\\n## Ethics and privacy\\n\\nAre there any ethical, commercial, or privacy issues that will affect the collection and storage of your data? Are you working with sensitive or personal data? Will you need to issue privacy notices?\\n\\nDescribe the legal and ethics procedures you will follow.\\n\\n### Ethics and informed consent\\n\\nEthical issues may affect how you store data, who can see/use it during collection and in future (data sharing), how long it is kept. You should show that you\\'re aware of this and have planned accordingly. The University\\'s Code of Research Conduct and Research Ethics provides guidance on what types of research will require ethical review. You are responsible for ensuring your handling of all this type of information is secure and complies with the law and associated research ethics procedures. Outline how you will obtain informed consent for the use of personal data as part of the research ethics process and to satisfy the duty of confidentiality towards the individual. The UK Data Service provides excellent guidance in structuring consent forms  that respect legal obligations and facilitate data archiving and publishing.\\n\\n### Data protection\\n\\nIf working with personal information you will have legal obligations with regard to data protection. You should provide a short statement around how you will comply with the GDPR/Data Protection Act 2018.\\n\\nSample text: \"Personal data will be collected during this project, and the project has considered ethical and legal implications in its data storage, as well as appropriate security of personal data. All participants will agree to data collection and to long-term retention, archiving, and sharing of their anonymised data. Research will follow standard ethical procedures of the Faculty of Arts and the University of Nottingham. Specific aspects will be considered by the Faculty ethics committee as appropriate. In particular, the creation of data from interviews and focus groups will require ethical approval, including consent forms outlining the storage and use for research purposes of data, including access to those data by project researchers and other researchers, both during and after the life of the project. Participants will be informed that they can withdraw their participation at any stage during or after the observations. As we will be working with personal data we will ensure that we comply with the Data Protection Act 2018, including GDPR requirements. This will include providing research participants with the relevant privacy information and ensuring appropriate safeguards for the storage and handling of data are in place.\"\\n\\n### Data storage and security\\n\\nWhere and how will your data will be stored, backed-up, transferred, and secured during the active phase (short to medium term) of research?\\n\\nDescribe where and how your data will be stored, secured, backed-up and be recovered, and why these choices are appropriate (for security, data maintenance and recovery, and appropriate costs). Describe what devices will be used to capture, process, and store data. Describe back up procedures. When working in the field, describe how you will ensure data is encrypted and securely transferred to a University of Nottingham approved storage solution. You should also describe additional safeguards that you may utilise, such as the anonymisation of personal and sensitive data.\\n\\nSample text: \"We will use UoN-provided storage for our working data. UoN licenses Microsoft Teams, allowing for secure and controlled sharing of data among the research team. Microsoft Teams encrypts data both in transit and at rest and is approved against the University’s Handling Restricted Data Policy. The service provides several layers of automatic back up and, in a disaster scenario, files can be recovered. Access to data stored in MS Teams is via secure log-in with multifactor authentication.”\\n\\nSample text: “We will use UoN Central Performance Storage for our working data. This storage is specifically designed to be used for high throughput data or large file sizes. The storage is onpremise and approved against the University’s Handling Restricted Data Policy. Files are automatically backed up and files older than 24 hours can be recovered in a disaster scenario.”\\n\\n### Data management, documentation and curation\\n\\nWhat are your principles, systems, and major standards for data management and creation? What metadata and documentation will you keep?\\n\\nData documentation: Highlight what sort of documentation you intend to provide, including what software and processes/protocols will be required to understand, reuse, and validate the datasets. For example, descriptions of data that enable research data to be used by others outside of your own team. This may include documenting the methods used to generate the data, analytical and procedural information, capturing instrument metadata alongside data, documenting provenance of data and their coding, detailed descriptions for variables, records, etc.\\n\\nMetadata: When depositing data, repositories will usually require descriptive metadata that describes the data in detail: typically, a title, a brief description of the dataset, and the creator(s) of the data. Provide an overview of what metadata you will provide in order to facilitate discoverability and use of the data. There are various metadata standards which can help you to describe your data in a consistent way, and individual data repositories will advise on the relevant standards. You should provide as much information as you are able to. As an example of the kind of information requested, please see our guide for depositing data within the University of Nottingham\\'s data repository.\\n\\nSample text: \"We shall record and provide documentation via a README file that will describe:\\n\\nour research aims, objectives and hypotheses;\\nour data collection methods, including the hardware and software used and any calibration carried out;\\na description of our data validation and quality assurance procedures undertaken;\\n0 a description of the dataset structure and what each file relationships between files or versions of the dataset.\\n\\nIn addition, we shall provide templates of our interview sheets and consent forms.\"\\n\\nSample text: \"On deposit of our data and associated documentation we shall provide catalogue metadata that will facilitate the discovery of our data. This shall conform with the DataCite metadata schema.\"\\n\\n### Data preservation\\n\\nHow will you ensure the long-term storage and preservation of data?\\n\\nOutline how you will ensure data is stored long-term: state where you will deposit your data (your nominated data centre or repository), and how long it will be preserved for. Some research funders and regulators specify how long data should be retained for. Where this is articulated, you should describe how you will meet this requirement (i.e., selecting an appropriate repository that guarantees preservation for a minimum period). In all other circumstances, the University expects data to be retained for a minimum of 7 years. Outline what data you will retain. Not all data will be suitable for retention, but some data will be mandated for retention. Identify any data repository (- ies) that are, or will be, entrusted with storing, curating and/or sharing data from your study, where they exist for particular disciplinary domains or data types. Most funders recommend that data underpinning\\n\\nresearch outputs should be deposited in an established data repository that specialises in retention, preservation, and publication of data. When choosing a repository, you should consider:\\n\\nAre the repository’s terms and conditions acceptable and do they align with funder requirements?\\nWill support for access or curation be needed from the data centre that exceeds the norm, and has this been planned for/ costed?\\nWhere is your data going to be stored and does this meet legal or ethical obligations such as compliance with the GDPR?\\nWill your dataset be given a permanent identifier, such as a DOI, so that the link to your data will stay the same even if the web URLs change?\\nIs the repository used by researchers in your discipline? Does the repository already have a good reputation in your field and is it recommended by your funder or your journal?\\nDoes the repository allow you to describe your data sufficiently, so it is easy to find and easy to cite?\\uf020\\nIs the repository established and well-funded so that you can rely on it still preserving your data in 10 years’ time?\\uf020\\nIn your data management plan, you should state where your data will be deposited for long term preservation, and identify any costs associated with storing and making your research data available online.\\n\\nIf a data centre exists for your specific discipline, then it is usually recommended to choose this option. Some funders mandate deposit in a specific repository, for example, ESRC data must be deposited with the UK Data Service within 3 months of project end; NERC has a network of environmental data centres to provide a similar job for research it funds. See the NERC Data Centre or the ESRC-supported UK Data Service. You can check if a repository exists for your discipline by searching the re3data.org Registry of research data repositories.\\n\\nIf there is no established data repository available for your discipline or funder, the University of Nottingham also has its own Research Data repository, which issues a DOI (Digital Object Identifier) for each dataset deposited so that it can be easily cited. The repository can be used to either deposit a closed (private) dataset, publish data openly, or under controlled access restrictions. The repository will provide access to your data in line with your funder\\'s retention period.\\n\\nSample text: “All anonymised research data created by the project will be deposited in the UoN research data archive (  UoN will retain and preserve research data in line with UoN and [insert your funder\\'s name] requirements for a minimum of 7 [or insert your funder\\'s minimum retention requirement if longer] years, but data will be retained for longer periods of time where it is of continual value to users\\n\\nSample text: \"All research data created by the project will be deposited in [name of the data repository] who will store and maintain the data on our behalf in line with our funder\\'s requirements. There is no cost for this service.\"\\n\\n## Data sharing, publication and access\\n\\nHow will the data generated be shared and published?\\n\\nDescribe what data will be suitable for sharing and how this will be achieved (through a data repository, or a description of the data in a data journal). Indicate how potential new users (outside of your organisation) can find out about your data. Indicate whether the data will be deposited in and available from an identified community database, repository, archive or other infrastructure established to curate and share data. If the data will be suitable for controlled access, identify who makes or will make the decision on whether to supply the data to a potential new user. Indicate whether external users are (will be) bound by data sharing agreements, setting out their main responsibilities. If the data will not be suitable for sharing, justify why this is the case. If you do not wish to share the data for a limited, defined period of exclusive use of data for primary research, show how this restriction on sharing is based on simple, clear principles. What are the timescale/dependencies for when data will be accessible to others outside of your team? Summarize the principles of your current/intended policy. Indicate whether your policy or approach to data sharing is (or will be) published on your study website (or by other means).\\n\\nOutline the way(s) in which your data will be shared (e.g., DOI), and/or any justification for why this is not possible. How will data be shared, and what is its value to others? State the timeline for public release of data and the mechanism to achieve this. The preferred way to share data is by depositing it with data repositories who will either publish it openly online, or offer some form of controlled access. You can also publish a description of your dataset in a data journal. You will need to include a data access statement in published outputs or final reports referencing your DOI, or, where and how data can be accessed.\\n\\nWill the data be open, or will you charge to access it? Justify if charging.\\n\\nHow will you license the data?\\n\\nHow will you ensure that your data is Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Re-usable?\\n\\nState when you intend to share or release your data, including any planned embargo period and the justification for this. Some communities have established timeframes for releasing data. These disciplinary guidelines, if they exist, should be referenced in the DMP. State any restrictions or delays to sharing, with planned actions to limit such restrictions. For most funders, a limited and defined period of exclusive use is acceptable (embargoes). This may be for reasons such as to avoid compromising research results by premature sharing, or to allow for the filing of patent applications.\\n\\nIt is also acknowledged that not all data can or should be \\'open\\' and so publishing and sharing data may need to be restricted, for example:\\n\\nlegal requirements – if your data includes personal information subject to the Data\\nProtection Act 2018 and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\\nethical concerns – if your data includes personal or confidential data where no consent for sharing has been given.\\nlicence restrictions – if you are using data owned by third parties and don’t have the rights to share.\\uf020\\n\\nIf you believe your data will require controlled access state this here. Details of the managed access process should be provided, including if a Data Sharing Agreement will be completed for each data request. If you expect obstacles to sharing your data, explain which and the possible measures you can apply to overcome these. Make explicit mention of the planned procedures to handle consent for data sharing for data obtained from human participants, and/or how to anonymise data, to make sure that data can be made available and accessible for future scientific research.\\n\\nSample text: \" All data for which consent to share has been obtained will be shared via the University of Nottingham data archive under a CC-BY license. Any data which is deemed to be personally or commercially sensitive will assessed on a case-by-case basis to determine whether it can be shared. There will be no need to update the data past the project period. All published outputs will contain a Data Availability Statement including the datacite DOI that directs to the relevant data set. Data will be released at the same time as any published outputs underpinned by the data or by one year from the end of the project.\"\\n\\nSample text: \"The anonymised data (transcripts and questionnaires) will be deposited in the University of Nottingham data archive once all data has been gathered, anonymised, and cleansed [in line with the timelines mandated by my funder for the timely deposit of data]. In order to minimise any further risk of disclosure, we shall control access requests to any data containing personal information to ensure the confidentiality of our research participants. Access agreements will be written on request in conjunction with the Research Contracts Team.\"\\n\\nSample text: \"The existence, range, and nature of the project’s original data will be publicised via references in published outputs by including relevant dataset DOIs, as well as via conference presentations and materials produced during the project.\"\\n\\nSample text: \"Our data will be deposited in the University of Nottingham data archive. Access to this dataset will be embargoed for a period of 3 months in order for us to complete our analysis of the dataset.\"\\n\\n## Roles and responsibilities\\n\\nWho will be responsible for managing data, data security, data quality, and data security both during the award and post-award?\\n\\nOutline who will be responsible for owning, storing, analysing and archiving your data within research teams at all partner institutions. Describe how these responsibilities will be regulated. Provide details on governance of access. Describe what resources you will require to deliver your data management plan. Describe how you will ensure quality across team members collecting and processing data.\\n\\n### Relevant policies\\n\\nList the relevant institutional, departmental, or study policies.\\n\\nSample text: \"We will ensure that our research aligns with the requirements of the University\\'s Research Data Management Policy, Information Security Policy, Code of Research Conduct and Research Ethics.\"\\n\\nSample text: \"We will ensure that our research aligns with the requirements of the University\\'s Research Data Management Policy, Information Security Policy, Code of Research Conduct and Research Ethics. As we are working with personal data, we will abide by the University’s Handling Restricted Data Policy and Data Protection Policy. All third-party commercial data or new data that may be suitable for commercial exploitation will be protected by the University\\'s Intellectual Property policy.\"\\n\\n### Intellectual property\\n\\nWho will own the copyright and IPR of any data that you will collect or create? Will you create a licence(s) for its use and reuse? If you are planning to use existing data as part of your research, do any copyright or other restrictions determine its use?\\n\\nCopyright and IPR of new datasets: State who will own the copyright and IPR of any data that you will collect or create, along with the licence(s) for its use and reuse. An agreement concerning intellectual property ownership with a third party, such as a research funder or commercial sponsor may exist. For multi-partner projects, IPR ownership may be worth covering in a formal consortium or collaboration agreement. In the absence of such an agreement, the University of Nottingham asserts its ownership of rights in datasets generated using the institution\\'s facilities.\\n\\nCopyright and IPR for existing datasets: If you are planning to use existing data as part of your research, you should state the copyright or other restrictions which determine its use. If possible, you should investigate these issues and attempt to gain copyright clearance so that your data can be shared at the end of your project. You should give full and appropriate acknowledgement, via citation, for any existing data that you use.\\n\\nSample text: \"This project is being carried out in collaboration with an industrial partner. The University of Nottingham and our industrial partner will jointly own the data generated, as set out in the collaboration agreement.

Where dedicated resources are required, these should be outlined and justified as part of your plan and included in your overall budget. Many funders will cover costs associated with data management and sharing provided they are incurred within the funding period. You may wish to consider: Accessing third party data - are there costs associated with accessing third party data, for example, licences, or commercial providers; people and skills - is additional specialist expertise (or training for existing staff) required?; storage and computation - will additional computational resources be needed in order to process, analyse or store your data?; archive – will there be any costs associated with preserving and/or sharing your research data, such as using a repository? Estimate the costs for making your data FAIR. Describe how you intend to cover these costs. Describe costs and potential value of long term preservation.',\n",
       " '# University of Oxford Research Data Management Policy\\n\\n## 1. Introduction\\n\\n### 1.1 Statement of intent\\n\\n1.1.1 The University of Oxford takes pride in the wealth of research data which its academic community produces, and wishes to ensure the widest possible access to its world-class research. The value and utility of research outputs increases the more broadly they are available to be considered and used by others, including scholars, businesses and charities around the globe, as well as society in general. Access for everyone in any location to Oxford’s preserved and shared research data will also help to highlight the excellence of its research. It will attract scholars and students, foster collaboration, and enhance public engagement with research, and maximise the intellectual, social, cultural and economic impact of research.\\n\\n1.1.2 The University of Oxford also recognises that good practice in data management is key to an efficient and effective research process. It is essential for enabling and safeguarding the longevity and continuing intelligibility of data, and for ensuring that sensitive data is handled in compliance with all relevant ethical and legal requirements. Preserving the data that underpins research outputs, whether it is shared or not, is integral to research integrity and reproducibility of results. Sharing data outputs also helps promote the work of our researchers and creates opportunities for future collaborations.\\n\\n1.1.3  The University promotes compliance with relevant funder and publisher policies, supports the Concordat on Open Research Data and the UKRI Common Principles on Data and is committed to ensuring that access to data is as open as possible, as closed as necessary and, as appropriate, follows the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable) principles for data management.\\n\\n1.1.4 This policy is intended to promote good practice regarding research data, with the aim that it is:\\n\\na. stored securely and preserved in order to ensure its continuing utility;\\nb. appropriately identifiable, retrievable, and available when needed;\\nc. an accurate, complete, reliable and coherent representation of the materials collected;\\nd. kept in a manner that is compliant with legal obligations, including UK Data Protection legislation and the Freedom of Information Act 2000, and, where applicable, the requirements of funding bodies and project-specific protocols approved under the University’s Research Ethics Policy;\\ne. able to be made available to others in line with appropriate ethical, data sharing and open research principles, especially when the data underpins published research.\\n\\n### 1.2 Scope\\n\\n1.2.1 This policy is for all staff (this includes technical and other support staff, and persons with honorary positions) and students conducting or supporting research at, or on behalf of, the University (hereafter referred to collectively as “researchers”). Principal Investigators have overall responsibility for effective data management during research projects. However, all researchers affiliated with the University, including undergraduate and postgraduate students, have a personal responsibility to contribute to the effective management of the data they produce, and must therefore act in accordance with the aims stated in section 1 of this policy.\\n\\n1.2.2 For the purposes of this document and its related guidelines, the following terms may be defined as below:\\n\\nResearch: a process of investigation leading to new insights. It includes work of direct relevance to the needs of commerce, industry, and to the public and voluntary sectors; scholarship; the invention and generation of ideas, images, performances, artefacts including design, where these lead to new or substantially improved insights; and the use of existing knowledge in experimental development to produce new or substantially improved materials, devices, products and processes, including design and construction.\\nResearch data: the recorded information (regardless of the form or the media in which it may exist) necessary to support or validate a research project’s observations, findings or outputs, or which is required for legal or regulatory compliance.\\nResearcher: Anyone who conducts research for, on behalf of, or in association with the University, on University premises or using University facilities or funding.\\nPrincipal Investigator: a researcher with overall responsibility for a research project, of any size, conducted for, on behalf of, or in association with the University; on University premises; or using University facilities or funding.\\n\\n## 2. Responsibilities of the University\\n\\n2.1 The University will provide:\\n\\na. sufficient support, advice and information to researchers on all aspects of research data management. b. suitable infrastructure to facilitate the appropriate management of research data. c. relevant training to promote best practice in research data management.\\n\\n2.2 In order to support and enable this policy, the University will engage with researchers to ensure that the research data management services and infrastructure capabilities it provides are adequate and fit for the purpose of supporting researchers’ compliance with the policy, ensuring adherence to the FAIR principles for data management.\\n\\n2.3 Sources of relevant advice, support and information are listed below in Section 6.\\n\\n## 3. Responsibilities of the researcher\\n\\n3.1 Principal Investigators hold day-to-day responsibility for the effective management of research data generated within or obtained from their research, including by their research groups. This includes understanding and complying with the requirements of any relevant contract with or grant to the University that includes provisions regarding the ownership, preservation and dissemination of research data.\\n\\n3.2 Researchers will protect confidential, personal and sensitive personal research data in accordance with legal and ethical requirements related to the research they conduct.\\n\\n3.3 Researchers are expected to keep an accurate and comprehensive record of their research, including documenting clear procedures for the collection, storage, use, reuse, access and retention or deletion of the research data associated with their records. Where appropriate, this should include defining and documenting protocols and responsibilities in collaborative research projects. Researchers are encouraged to identify and utilise relevant data standards and protocols, and to document their data-related decisions in a Data Management Plan.\\n\\n3.4  Researchers are expected to recognise Intellectual Property arising from their research activities and manage that Intellectual Property according to any funder requirements or contractual obligations, and in accordance with University Statute XVI and associated University Regulations on commercial exploitation.\\n\\n3.5 Researchers will preserve and provide appropriate access to their research data supporting outputs after the end of their project for as long as it has continuing value, in accordance with legal and funder requirements and paying due regard to discipline norms and cost. Notwithstanding, the minimum retention period for research data and records is either three years after publication or public release of the work of the research, or completion if the work is unreleased, or that specified in the contract/grant agreement related to the work, whichever is longest.\\n\\n3.6 Researchers are expected to deposit their data supporting outputs in an appropriate data repository and provide sufficient information (such as a data availability statement and metadata record) to ensure that it can be found, understood, and cited. Where data is deposited somewhere other than the University’s institutional repository (the Oxford Research Archive, or ORA), a metadata record should also be created in ORA which describes and points to the data. External repositories, where used, should support the use of Open Researcher and Contributor IDs (ORCIDs) and Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs).\\n\\n3.7 Researchers are responsible for informing their Head of Department (or nominee) where their research data will be stored and who will have access to it after they leave (or retire from) the University.  The researcher’s department or faculty reserves the right to retain a copy of the data for an appropriate period to ensure compliance with any legal or regulatory responsibilities, and/or research grant or contractual requirements.\\n\\n## 4. Relationship with existing policies and guidance\\n\\n4.1 This policy operates in conjunction with other University policies, namely:\\n\\nAcademic Integrity in Research ( \\nResearch Ethics Policy\\n( \\nIntellectual Property Policy ( \\ncontracts-and-trusts#collapse1383596) and Regulations\\n( \\nData Protection Policy ( \\nFreedom of Information ( \\nInformation Security Policy ( \\nExport Controls Guidance ( \\nHuman Tissue Guidance ( \\n\\n## 5.

The Library systematically checks whether the underlying research data set/s related to these publications have also been made open access. They contact the authors if a data availability statement (or equivalent) and/or the data set/s appear to be missing.\\n\\n### Who can you contact if you have any queries about this document?\\n\\nResearch Data Officer - Gary Pike, researchdata@port.ac.uk\\n\\n### Executive summary\\n\\nThe Research Data Management (RDM) Policy sets out the University's expectations for staff when managing research data. The main points of the policy are:\\n\\n- that appropriate RDM planning takes place,\\n- Data Availability Statements (or equivalent text) are included for all research outputs, - a new UoP Research Data Archive has been set up to preserve data centrally, - that data sharing be enabled whenever possible.\\n\\n## Research Data Management Policy: A Summary\\n\\n### Introduction\\n\\nGiven current trends in data management practices, the process of data management is becoming increasingly important. Whilst this is placing increased burdens on academic research, it also offers additional opportunities for demonstration of best practice and research environment both for the University and also for the individual.\\n\\nFor example, where applicable, making data openly and publicly available offers the potential to demonstrate additional impact from the research, on the wider academic community and also beyond. As the activity of data management becomes more important this will also become more explicitly recognised in Performance Development Reviews (PDRs), annual research reviews and annual PhD reviews.\\n\\nIn addition to helping demonstrate good practice in terms of research design, it is also recognised in the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA) that the value of and impact of all research outputs including datasets and software as well as publications should be acknowledged.\\n\\n### Overview of Key Policy Points\\n\\na. There is now a need to include a Data Availability Statement (or equivalent wording/information in a data/methods/acknowledgement section) in all papers, whether or not the journals require them.\\n\\nb. Data sharing where possible/applicable is a requirement for data held by UoP. The minimum requirement is metadata necessary for reproduction of research results, with the best practice recommendation being making research data publicly and openly available to maximise the benefit for the academic and the institution. Depending on the subject area a publication in a data journal describing a dataset may be appropriate.\\n\\nc. Data deposition information must be made discoverable in Pure if the data are deposited externally.\\n\\n### Definitions\\n\\nFor the purpose of this Policy, these terms are defined as follows:\\n\\nA ‘Data Management Plan’ (DMP) typically states what research data are likely to be created as a result of certain research activities and outlines the plans for data collection, storage, processing, preservation, sharing/dissemination, and eventual (possible) destruction of such research data. A DMP might take the form of a stand-alone document or be part of a research funding application or research design protocol (for ethical review). It should be considered a living document, subject to necessary changes, for the duration of a project. For simple projects a DMP will likely be brief. For more complex projects it may act as an overview or index document for all the necessary DM processes.\\n\\nOpen Access’ (OA) means that research data are made available such that they can be accessed and used by the general public and other organisations, without cost to the user.\\n\\nThe ‘UoP Data Steward’ is the most senior University of Portsmouth Researcher (staff member) associated with the research data (but not necessarily responsible for the OA requirements). The Data Steward should be identified in the DMP. This is typically the Principal Investigator (PI) or, for a larger body of research work, it may be the Research Lead (e.g. Professor of the research team), or in the case of postgraduate research student (PGRS) projects it is typically their (First) Supervisor. In terms of the consequent data management responsibilities:\\n\\na. If you, as a UoP employee, are the holder of the data, then you must hold the data in OA accessible format and are responsible for the data for data management purposes\\n\\nb. If you (as the UoP academic) are the corresponding author for published work, then you either must hold the data (in OA accessible format) yourself, or have a formal agreement with the holder of the data to be able to access it for data management purposes.\\n\\nc. If you are neither the corresponding author nor have agreed access to data for DM purposes, then you are not responsible for the DM OA requirement.\\n\\nd. If you are the UoP Data Steward because of your role as the First Supervisor of a PGRS, the Data Steward role is to promote good research practice and, in consultation with the PGR, endeavour to ensure that the relevant policies and processes (UoP/funders/other external) are followed by the PGRS (e.g. as demonstrated at major and annual review).\\n\\nThe ‘Regulatory Environment’ includes all applicable legislation, contractual or funder obligations, and ethics and other policy requirements. Examples of items to be considered within the regulatory environment include – but are not limited to – the following:\\n\\nLegislative: Data Protection Act 2018, UK GDPR and the EU GDPR, as well as the Freedom of Information Act 2000.\\nContractual: Funding terms and conditions, collaboration agreements (e.g. with external\\ncompanies or other institutions), third party licenses (e.g. when reusing data generated elsewhere), material transfer agreements, confidentiality agreements, and studentship agreements.\\nEthical: Ethical review procedures, and participant consents. (See Related Guidance Resources section.)\\nPolicies: University policies (see Related Policies section) and relevant funder/collaborator policies.\\n\\nUniversity of Portsmouth | Research Data Management Policy October 2021 | 6 of 11\\n\\nIt also includes the UK Research Integrity Office’s (UKRIO) Code of Practice for Research, which has been adopted by the University, and the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA), of which the University is a signatory.\\n\\n‘Research’ (in accordance with the Research Excellence Framework (REF) 2014 definition) means a process of investigation leading to new insights.\\n\\nIt includes work of direct relevance to the needs of commerce, industry, and to the public and volunteer sectors; scholarship; the invention and generation of ideas, images, performances, artefacts including design, where these lead to new or substantially improved insights; and the use of existing knowledge in experimental development to produce new or substantially improved materials, devices, products and processes, including design and construction.\\n\\nIt excludes routine testing and routine analysis of materials, components and processes such as for the maintenance of national standards, as distinct from the development of new analytical techniques. It also excludes the development of teaching materials that do not embody original research.\\n\\n‘Research Data’ are information created or collected in pursuit of research activities, which may be in digital or physical formats. All subject areas and disciplines have research data.\\n\\nThis includes all data that has been collated and transformed (e.g. placed in databases for analysis), and in general all data and metadata upon which the process of research has actively impinged and is necessary for reproduction of the research activity.\\n\\nThis includes all definitive records of information collected from and about living human subjects\\\\*, all experimental and survey results data, all records of relevant ephemeral events (performances, exhibits, etc).\\n\\n\\\\*NB: To enable the sharing of research data involving personal data, such data (as applicable) should be anonymised, either at the point of collection or as part of the processing. The GDPR/DPA2018 does not apply to anonymised data or data once anonymised, but does apply to the process of anonymisation, and therefore consent to the anonymisation of their data should still be obtained from participants.\\n\\nIt excludes research notes (except when these are the primary location of types of data defined above), transcriptions of information that remains accessible elsewhere in a digital format, and in general any records of information that would be accessible to a third party by following information provided in footnotes or references to the published research.\\n\\n## The Policy\\n\\n### 1. What does this Policy apply to?\\n\\nThis Policy applies to all University of Portsmouth research.\\n\\n### 2. Responsibility:\\n\\nThe UoP Data Steward is ultimately responsible for the management of UoP-held research data throughout all stages of research.\\n\\n### 3. Regulatory Environment:\\n\\nThe Data Steward is responsible for ensuring that the research adheres to all applicable requirements and conditions imposed by the Regulatory Environment.\\n\\n### 4. Planning:\\n\\nThe Data Steward must ensure that research data management planning takes place. This typically involves making a Data Management Plan.\\n\\n### 5. Costs:\\n\\nWhere possible, the Data Steward must seek to recover the direct costs of managing research data from an external research funder.\\n\\nWhen the research project is not externally funded it is acknowledged that there is an opportunity cost to data management activities. It is hoped, however, that these will be counterbalanced by the opportunities to demonstrate good research practice that will be created (e.g. in terms of additional data citations and data journal publications) and that such activity will become more explicitly recognised in PDRs and annual research reviews etc. (e.g. through the inclusion of evaluation of the quality of publications in data journals when assessing research workload allowances).\\n\\n### 6. Active Research Data:\\n\\nThe UoP Data Steward must ensure that ‘active’ research data held by UoP are stored securely and protected from loss, unlawful or unethical access, and in accordance with all other applicable requirements of the Regulatory Environment.\\n\\n### 7. Data Availability Statements and Publications:\\n\\nThe Data Steward must ensure that a statement describing research data availability is included in research publications and other relevant outputs. It is recognised that some journals do not have dedicated sections for statements, so as a minimum it may be necessary to include equivalent text in a data/methods section (most obviously), acknowledgments section, footnotes or their equivalents.\\n\\nData Availability Statement types (sometimes also referred to as Data Access Statements or similar variations):\\ni) There are no new data.\\nii) The data or references/link to secondary datasets are contained within the paper itself.\\niii) The data (and how to access them) are available, for example by providing a DOI link or repository information for physical samples.\\nFor best practice it is suggested that supplementary information be allocated a DOI and linked in the data statement. This practice gets around the issue of supplementary information being trapped behind a subscription paywall when only the post-print is accessible via the Green OA route. A data paper published in a data journal may also be appropriate for some datasets.\\n\\nUniversity of Portsmouth | Research Data Management Policy October 2021 | 8 of 11 iv) Data are available, but access is restricted: state the reason(s) for the restriction and how access can be obtained1.\\n\\n(Key Policy Point A)\\n\\n### 8. Archived Research Data:\\n\\ni) The Data Steward must ensure that research data held by UoP are archived for long-term preservation and (as far as possible) made OA if they substantiate published research findings, are of potential long-term value, and/or retention is a requirement of the Regulatory Environment. (Key Policy Point B)\\n\\nii) When making such research data OA, the Data Steward must ensure the research data (e.g. files) are stored in either an established subject specific repository or in the University’s own research data repository.\\n\\niii) When making such research data open access, the Data Steward must ensure that data are discoverable from the University’s own online research data repository, regardless of whether the research data themselves (e.g.files) are stored in the University’s repository or elsewhere. (A DOI will be allocated for dataset entries validated in Pure.) (Key Policy Point C)\\n\\niv) When making research data OA, the Data Steward must ensure that such research data are assigned a license that enables the data to be reused and shared by others under as permissible terms as the Regulatory Environment will allow.\\n\\nv) The Data Steward must ensure that such research data are made discoverable and accessible with first publication of research findings based on the research data, or within 12 months of project completion, whichever is sooner.\\n\\nvi) Unless the applicable Regulatory Environment specifies otherwise, such research data must be retained for a minimum of ten years in accordance with the University’s Retention Policy and schedule.\\n\\nvii) For staff leaving the University who need to archive research datasets please contact researchdata@port.ac.uk.\\n\\n## Related Policies and External Motivators\\n\\nCopyright Policy\\nData Protection Policy\\nEthics Policy\\nICT Acceptable Use Policy\\nInformation Governance Policy\\nInformation Security Policy\\nIntellectual Property (IP) Policy\\nProcedure for the Investigation of Allegations of Misconduct in Research\\nRetention Policy & Retention Schedule: 7.

The information regarding the novel DFG Code of Conduct in footnote 3 has been added editorially.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe University of Potsdam, as Brandenburg’s largest university, is oriented towards distinctive interdisciplinary research profiles in cooperation with a large number of non-university research institutions in the natural and human sciences, the humanities, and the social sciences. In many of these areas, data are an essential basis of scientific knowledge; since 2019, data-centric sciences have been designated as one of four focus areas for research at the University of Potsdam.\\n\\nResearch data can be the foundation for further research as well as the transfer of knowledge and technology, including for purposes beyond those for which the data were collected. Therefore, publishing and archiving research data serve not only for the replicability and verification of earlier results but also for the finding of new results. Recent developments in good scientific practice have given rise to new requirements regarding the handling of research data. Moreover, the digital transformation in academia confronts researchers and research support staff with challenges regarding capabilities and infrastructural prerequisites for research data management. Making data publishing and research data management a self-evident part of research practice will require cultural changes.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis policy governs the handling of data that is generated, reused, or processed as part of the research methods for research projects. This includes the methods and test procedures available as data, such as questionnaires or software. It also serves to implement the “Principles for Handling of Research Data” by the Alliance of Science Organisations in Germany1 and the “Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities” signed by the University of Potsdam in 20152.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis policy applies to all researchers and research support staff at the University of Potsdam. The University of Potsdam will publish recommendations on how researchers and research support staff can comply with the requirements of this policy.\\n\\n### I. Principles\\n\\n(1) The University of Potsdam is committed to free access to research data. Research data should be made available for reuse as openly as possible, unless interests worthy of protection predominate or legal requirements prevent their publication. Research data that constitute the basis of published results should be made accessible promptly and linked to the publication appropriately. Research data with high reuse potential should be published in a quality-assured manner regardless of their use for a text publication. In order to improve reproducibility and to acknowledge underlying academic achievements, reused data and research software should be cited.\\n\\n\\n\\n(2)\\t The University of Potsdam ensures the archiving of research data. Research data that constitute the basis of a text publication but are not themselves published are to be archived for at least 10 years using a suitable infrastructure. Storage of research data exclusively by the researchers themselves or the immediate deletion of the data are permissible only if interests worthy of protection predominate or legal requirements stipulate this, or in case no suitable infrastructure for archiving these data is available.\\n\\n(3) The University of Potsdam recognizes the preparation of research data for reuse and the development of reusable research software as academic achievements. The same applies to contributions to the advancement of discipline-specific good practice in the handling of research data and research software. The research output of the University of Potsdam includes quality-assured data and software publications that are recognized by the respective scientific community.\\n\\n\\n\\n(4)\\t All researchers are responsible for complying with good scientific practice regarding the handling of research data. The relevant discipline-specific guidelines by DFG review boards and academic associations on the handling of research data are to be taken into account. The following people bear special responsibility:\\n\\n1. Principle investigators, in particular with regard to a project’s documentation, openness, and reusability of research data as well as data protection.\\n2. Research group leaders with regard to cross-project aspects of data handling (e.g., using common standards for the quality and storage of comparable data from several studies).\\n\\n\\n\\n(5) Research students and early career researchers are entitled to appropriate information, qualification, and support from teaching staff and supervisors. In disciplines working with data, basics of the practical handling of research data should be taught as comprehensive course content, starting at the undergraduate level. Opportunities for postgraduate training should be created for young scientists, lecturers, and supervisors.\\n\\n### II.\\t Legal Framework\\n\\n(1)\\t Legally binding regulations on the handling of research data remain unaffected and take precedence over this policy.\\n(2)\\t Examples of legal and university regulations which result in rights and obligations with regard to research data are: 1. Regeln zur Sicherung guter wissenschaftlicher Praxis an der Universität Potsdam “Rules for Good Scientific Practice at the University of Potsdam”,3 2. Verfahrensordnung der Ethikkommission der Universität Potsdam “Rules of Procedure of the Ethics Committee of the University of Potsdam”,4 3. fundamental rights, in particular privacy rights, including data protection,5\\n\\n\\n\\n4.\\t intellectual property rights (copyright and related rights as well as patent law and related commercial rights, including regulations regarding employee inventions).\\n\\n\\n\\n(3) Further binding regulations may result from agreements, e.g., in grant, cooperation, and license contracts. In particular, the requirements of funding bodies for the management, publishing, and archiving of research data must be met. Any restrictions on the openness and reusability of research data through contracts and other agreements that contravene the principles of this policy are to be avoided.\\n\\n\\n\\n### III.\\t Institutional Responsibility\\n\\n(1)\\t As part of its research data strategy, the University of Potsdam commits itself to create the technical and organizational preconditions that enable compliance with this policy.\\n(2)\\t The University of Potsdam initiates a cross-faculty discussion and development process on open science and the digital transformation in research, as well as on data handling competence training in teaching for degree courses and in postgraduate training.\\n(3)\\t The University of Potsdam supports declarations and initiatives at the state, federal, European, and international levels that promote free access to research data, the recognition of data and software publications as research output, good practice in research data management, and good conditions for data-intensive research.\\n(4)\\t The activities of the University of Potsdam in the field of research data take gender and diversity aspects into account.\\n\\n\\n\\n### IV. Validity\\n\\n(1)\\t This policy shall enter into force after the day of its publication in Amtliche Bekanntmachungen “Official Notices” of the University of Potsdam.\\n(2)\\t It will be reviewed together with the associated research data strategy of the University of Potsdam when necessary, but no later than in 2023.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Recommendations for the Handling of Research Data at the University of Potsdam\\n\\nNon-official translation of the recommendations adopted by Senate’s Commission for Research and Junior Academics (FNK) on June 26, 2019, duly noted by Senate on September 25, 2019, with changes adopted by FNK on October 9, 2019 to match the requirements of the novel DFG Code of Conduct Guidelines for Safeguarding Good Research Practice.\\n\\nThese recommendations specify and complement the Research Data Policy of University of Potsdam. They are aimed at all researchers and research support staff.\\n\\n### I. Working with Research Data\\n\\nThe requirements of good scientific practice regarding honest, methodologically correct, thorough, reliable, and replicable work through good documentation also apply to the handling of research data. Principle overarching elements of secure and well-documented work with research data are listed below. For the planning and structured documentation of these elements it is recommended to use data management plans (DMP) as instruments for project and quality management and to update them regularly. DMP can be created at the level of a project, a data-intensive research instrument, or a working group, as needed. In the case of projects which pose an exceptional burden on centrally-operated infrastructure, central facilities may require the submission of a DMP.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1. Purpose of the data. It is recommended to determine at an early stage which data will be published or archived and which data will continue to be stored by the researchers themselves. It is useful to define holding periods. Data that are no longer needed, nor worth publishing or archiving, should be deleted regularly. In particular, personal data are subject to the principle of storage limitation: storage is only permitted as long as strictly necessary for the respective purpose. Therefore, research data that contains personally identifyable information must be anonymized as soon as possible according to the research purpose.1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2. Intellectual property. Research data usually is not covered by copyright or related intellectual property rights, but in certain cases multiple rights may accrue to different persons. Ownership and usage rights of research data are therefore often unclear, which can limit its reuse. For each pro ject with multiple participants it is therefore recommended to document at an early stage which rights may have accrued to whom, the intention to publish the data, and the reciprocal granting of the relevant usage rights.\\n\\n3. Secure storage. Data loss is to be prevented through the use of suitable storage services or of storage media and appropriate backups. The use of storage services run by the scientific community is recommended; the use of local storage media and of commercial storage services as a private customer is discouraged. In many cases version-control is helpful. The necessary level of data security is to be ensured by appropriate technical and organizational measures, e.g. effective access restrictions and pseudonymization of personal data that cannot be fully anonymized.\\n\\n4. Documentation and use of standards. To make data reusable it is necessary to document the context in which the data was created and the tools used for data processing. For the sake of interoperability and long-term readability, the use of appropriate file formats is recommended with preference given to formats using open standards. To further reproducibility it is recommended to define and document conventions for fle names and folder hierarchies early on; to use suitable, and when possible subject-specific metadata standards; and to collect relevant metadata already during the research process.\\n\\n\\n\\n### II. Publication and Citation of Research Data\\n\\n\\n\\nThe rules of good scientific practice for publishing also apply to data and software publications. In particular, it is prohibited to withhold data that does not support the authors’ hypotheses, to fragment data and software publications with the aim of increasing the number of publications, or to duplicate publications without disclosing the previous publication. The following points provide further guidance regarding the publication and citation of research data.\\n\\n1. Place of publication. For the publication of research data, well-established discipline- or data-type-specific databases, repositories, and data centers should be preferred. Infrastructures should be used in which data are kept and can be referenced independently; research data should not exclusively be provided with the text publication as supplementary material.\\n\\n2. Preparation and availability of data. Research data should be made accessible in a processing stage (raw or structured data) that enables meaningful reuse by third parties. It is recommended to strive for consistent adherence to the FAIR data principles (findable, accessible, interoper able, and reusable) when preparing data for publication and selecting the place of publication.2 The four principles articulate the following basic requirements:\\n\\n\\n\\na. Findability: The data is sufficiently described with relevant metadata and referenced by a unique persistent identifier (e.g., a DOI).\\nb. Accessibility: The data is readable by both humans and machines and is stored in a trusted repository.\\nc. Interoperability: Data and metadata use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable vocabulary for knowledge representation.\\nd. Reusability: The data is unambiguously licensed, contains correct provenance information, and is well documented.3\\n\\nSelf-programmed research software should be made publicly available as source code. Source code of published software should be persistent, citable, and documented.4\\n\\n3. Authorship. A person who makes a genuine, accountable contribution to the content of academic data or software publication is an author. Such a contribution is established especially through substantial research-based involvement in the creation, collection, acquisition, or provision of the data, software, or sources.5\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4. Free licensing and open access. Research data and scientific software should be made available under established, standardized and, as far as possible, free and open licenses. Access conditions and, if applicable, embargo periods should adhere to the principle of “as open as possible, as closed as necessary”. The following points provide specific guidance for licensing:\\n\\na. Licensing and attribution: The obligation to attribute academic achievements is a principle of good scientific practice. Licenses and waivers for data and software that do not contractually require the attribution of the authors do not supersede this obligation. The preferred way to promote data and software citation is not through restrictive licensing but by including a recommended citation.\\n\\n\\n\\nb. Public research data: Creative Commons tools have become the most common way to license research data that is made publicly available. Data that is free of copyright and related rights should be labelled as such upon release using the “Creative Commons Zero” (CC0) waiver. For data that is protected by copyright or related rights, using the CC0 waiver is also recommended because it is the best way to ensure reusability. The license “Creative Commons Attribution” (CC BY) can also be considered, but due to the strict formal requirements regarding attribution and the provision of license information it already limits subsequent use. Creative Commons licenses with terms that go beyond the “Attribution” element are not suitable for licensing research data (“Non-Commercial”, NC; “No Derivative Works”, ND), or are suitable only in certain cases and only to a limited extent (“Sharing under Equal Conditions”, SA).6\\n\\n\\n\\nc. Research data for “Scientific Use” only: Research data to which access has to be restricted should be licensed in consultation with the approriate data center using the licenses recommended by them.\\n\\nd. Software: Creative Commons licenses (such as CC BY) are not suitable for software. A CC0 waiver can be granted for completely selfwritten code (to which the programmers own all rights). This is especially useful for short scripts. Free software licenses should be used for more complex products. Examples of common free software licenses are the MIT license and the GNU GPLv3.7\\n\\n\\n\\n5. Registration of research output. Quality-assured data and software publications that are recognized by the respective scientific community and can be referenced independently should be reported to the University Library by the authors for inclusion in the University Bibliography.\\n\\n6. Citation of data and software. If no subject-specific standards have been established yet for the citation of data and software and if no guidelines by the journal or the publisher are available, it is recommended to refer to the Data Citation Principles.8\\n\\n### III.\\t Contracts and Cooperations\\n\\n\\n\\n1. When negotiating grant agreements, in particular with private sponsors, cooperation agreements, and license agreements, researchers and research support staff should ensure that these agreements observe the principles of the Research Data Policy of the University of Potsdam as much as possible, in particular with regard to the openness and reusability of research data. When transferring rights for reuse, publication, or commercial utilization, care should be taken to ensure that the data remain freely available for scientific purposes, and in particular that no exclusive rights are granted to commercial actors.\\n\\n2. Cross-institutional research cooperations should align their practices with the Research Data Policy of the University of Potsdam, unless other parties mandate equivalent or stricter requirements. Within the framework of their governance, institutionalised cooperations like clusters and networks should establish clear and binding regulations on joint data management as well as on the openness and usability of their research data at an early stage.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### IV.\\t Institutional Responsibility\\n\\n\\n\\n1. All faculties are advised to consider whether qualification theses should contain statements on data availability in the future and, if so, to set up regulations with an appropriate degree of bindingness.\\n2. The study commissions are advised to reassess curricula to ensure appropriate consideration of the practical handling of research data as comprehensive course content in undergraduate and consecutive Masters programs.\\n3. Departments and research groups are advised to appoint research data contacts to enable institutional archiving of the research data at the University of Potsdam.',\n",

Opportunities for postgraduate training should be created for young scientists, lecturers, and supervisors.\\n\\n### II.\\t Legal Framework\\n\\n(1)\\t Legally binding regulations on the handling of research data remain unaffected and take precedence over this policy.\\n(2)\\t Examples of legal and university regulations which result in rights and obligations with regard to research data are: 1. Regeln zur Sicherung guter wissenschaftlicher Praxis an der Universität Potsdam “Rules for Good Scientific Practice at the University of Potsdam”,3 2. Verfahrensordnung der Ethikkommission der Universität Potsdam “Rules of Procedure of the Ethics Committee of the University of Potsdam”,4 3. fundamental rights, in particular privacy rights, including data protection,5\\n\\n\\n\\n4.\\t intellectual property rights (copyright and related rights as well as patent law and related commercial rights, including regulations regarding employee inventions).\\n\\n\\n\\n(3) Further binding regulations may result from agreements, e.g., in grant, cooperation, and license contracts. In particular, the requirements of funding bodies for the management, publishing, and archiving of research data must be met. Any restrictions on the openness and reusability of research data through contracts and other agreements that contravene the principles of this policy are to be avoided.\\n\\n\\n\\n### III.\\t Institutional Responsibility\\n\\n(1)\\t As part of its research data strategy, the University of Potsdam commits itself to create the technical and organizational preconditions that enable compliance with this policy.\\n(2)\\t The University of Potsdam initiates a cross-faculty discussion and development process on open science and the digital transformation in research, as well as on data handling competence training in teaching for degree courses and in postgraduate training.\\n(3)\\t The University of Potsdam supports declarations and initiatives at the state, federal, European, and international levels that promote free access to research data, the recognition of data and software publications as research output, good practice in research data management, and good conditions for data-intensive research.\\n(4)\\t The activities of the University of Potsdam in the field of research data take gender and diversity aspects into account.\\n\\n\\n\\n### IV. Validity\\n\\n(1)\\t This policy shall enter into force after the day of its publication in Amtliche Bekanntmachungen “Official Notices” of the University of Potsdam.\\n(2)\\t It will be reviewed together with the associated research data strategy of the University of Potsdam when necessary, but no later than in 2023.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Recommendations for the Handling of Research Data at the University of Potsdam\\n\\nNon-official translation of the recommendations adopted by Senate’s Commission for Research and Junior Academics (FNK) on June 26, 2019, duly noted by Senate on September 25, 2019, with changes adopted by FNK on October 9, 2019 to match the requirements of the novel DFG Code of Conduct Guidelines for Safeguarding Good Research Practice.\\n\\nThese recommendations specify and complement the Research Data Policy of University of Potsdam. They are aimed at all researchers and research support staff.\\n\\n### I. Working with Research Data\\n\\nThe requirements of good scientific practice regarding honest, methodologically correct, thorough, reliable, and replicable work through good documentation also apply to the handling of research data. Principle overarching elements of secure and well-documented work with research data are listed below. For the planning and structured documentation of these elements it is recommended to use data management plans (DMP) as instruments for project and quality management and to update them regularly. DMP can be created at the level of a project, a data-intensive research instrument, or a working group, as needed. In the case of projects which pose an exceptional burden on centrally-operated infrastructure, central facilities may require the submission of a DMP.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1. Purpose of the data. It is recommended to determine at an early stage which data will be published or archived and which data will continue to be stored by the researchers themselves. It is useful to define holding periods. Data that are no longer needed, nor worth publishing or archiving, should be deleted regularly. In particular, personal data are subject to the principle of storage limitation: storage is only permitted as long as strictly necessary for the respective purpose. Therefore, research data that contains personally identifyable information must be anonymized as soon as possible according to the research purpose.1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2. Intellectual property. Research data usually is not covered by copyright or related intellectual property rights, but in certain cases multiple rights may accrue to different persons. Ownership and usage rights of research data are therefore often unclear, which can limit its reuse. For each pro ject with multiple participants it is therefore recommended to document at an early stage which rights may have accrued to whom, the intention to publish the data, and the reciprocal granting of the relevant usage rights.\\n\\n3. Secure storage. Data loss is to be prevented through the use of suitable storage services or of storage media and appropriate backups. The use of storage services run by the scientific community is recommended; the use of local storage media and of commercial storage services as a private customer is discouraged. In many cases version-control is helpful. The necessary level of data security is to be ensured by appropriate technical and organizational measures, e.g. effective access restrictions and pseudonymization of personal data that cannot be fully anonymized.\\n\\n4. Documentation and use of standards. To make data reusable it is necessary to document the context in which the data was created and the tools used for data processing. For the sake of interoperability and long-term readability, the use of appropriate file formats is recommended with preference given to formats using open standards. To further reproducibility it is recommended to define and document conventions for fle names and folder hierarchies early on; to use suitable, and when possible subject-specific metadata standards; and to collect relevant metadata already during the research process.\\n\\n\\n\\n### II. Publication and Citation of Research Data\\n\\n\\n\\nThe rules of good scientific practice for publishing also apply to data and software publications. In particular, it is prohibited to withhold data that does not support the authors’ hypotheses, to fragment data and software publications with the aim of increasing the number of publications, or to duplicate publications without disclosing the previous publication. The following points provide further guidance regarding the publication and citation of research data.\\n\\n1. Place of publication. For the publication of research data, well-established discipline- or data-type-specific databases, repositories, and data centers should be preferred. Infrastructures should be used in which data are kept and can be referenced independently; research data should not exclusively be provided with the text publication as supplementary material.\\n\\n2. Preparation and availability of data. Research data should be made accessible in a processing stage (raw or structured data) that enables meaningful reuse by third parties. It is recommended to strive for consistent adherence to the FAIR data principles (findable, accessible, interoper able, and reusable) when preparing data for publication and selecting the place of publication.2 The four principles articulate the following basic requirements:\\n\\n\\n\\na. Findability: The data is sufficiently described with relevant metadata and referenced by a unique persistent identifier (e.g., a DOI).\\nb. Accessibility: The data is readable by both humans and machines and is stored in a trusted repository.\\nc. Interoperability: Data and metadata use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable vocabulary for knowledge representation.\\nd. Reusability: The data is unambiguously licensed, contains correct provenance information, and is well documented.3\\n\\nSelf-programmed research software should be made publicly available as source code. Source code of published software should be persistent, citable, and documented.4\\n\\n3. Authorship. A person who makes a genuine, accountable contribution to the content of academic data or software publication is an author. Such a contribution is established especially through substantial research-based involvement in the creation, collection, acquisition, or provision of the data, software, or sources.5\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4. Free licensing and open access. Research data and scientific software should be made available under established, standardized and, as far as possible, free and open licenses. Access conditions and, if applicable, embargo periods should adhere to the principle of “as open as possible, as closed as necessary”. The following points provide specific guidance for licensing:\\n\\na. Licensing and attribution: The obligation to attribute academic achievements is a principle of good scientific practice. Licenses and waivers for data and software that do not contractually require the attribution of the authors do not supersede this obligation. The preferred way to promote data and software citation is not through restrictive licensing but by including a recommended citation.\\n\\n\\n\\nb. Public research data: Creative Commons tools have become the most common way to license research data that is made publicly available. Data that is free of copyright and related rights should be labelled as such upon release using the “Creative Commons Zero” (CC0) waiver. For data that is protected by copyright or related rights, using the CC0 waiver is also recommended because it is the best way to ensure reusability. The license “Creative Commons Attribution” (CC BY) can also be considered, but due to the strict formal requirements regarding attribution and the provision of license information it already limits subsequent use. Creative Commons licenses with terms that go beyond the “Attribution” element are not suitable for licensing research data (“Non-Commercial”, NC; “No Derivative Works”, ND), or are suitable only in certain cases and only to a limited extent (“Sharing under Equal Conditions”, SA).6\\n\\n\\n\\nc. Research data for “Scientific Use” only: Research data to which access has to be restricted should be licensed in consultation with the approriate data center using the licenses recommended by them.\\n\\nd. Software: Creative Commons licenses (such as CC BY) are not suitable for software. A CC0 waiver can be granted for completely selfwritten code (to which the programmers own all rights). This is especially useful for short scripts. Free software licenses should be used for more complex products. Examples of common free software licenses are the MIT license and the GNU GPLv3.7\\n\\n\\n\\n5. Registration of research output. Quality-assured data and software publications that are recognized by the respective scientific community and can be referenced independently should be reported to the University Library by the authors for inclusion in the University Bibliography.\\n\\n6. Citation of data and software. If no subject-specific standards have been established yet for the citation of data and software and if no guidelines by the journal or the publisher are available, it is recommended to refer to the Data Citation Principles.8\\n\\n### III.\\t Contracts and Cooperations\\n\\n\\n\\n1. When negotiating grant agreements, in particular with private sponsors, cooperation agreements, and license agreements, researchers and research support staff should ensure that these agreements observe the principles of the Research Data Policy of the University of Potsdam as much as possible, in particular with regard to the openness and reusability of research data. When transferring rights for reuse, publication, or commercial utilization, care should be taken to ensure that the data remain freely available for scientific purposes, and in particular that no exclusive rights are granted to commercial actors.\\n\\n2. Cross-institutional research cooperations should align their practices with the Research Data Policy of the University of Potsdam, unless other parties mandate equivalent or stricter requirements. Within the framework of their governance, institutionalised cooperations like clusters and networks should establish clear and binding regulations on joint data management as well as on the openness and usability of their research data at an early stage.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### IV.\\t Institutional Responsibility\\n\\n\\n\\n1. All faculties are advised to consider whether qualification theses should contain statements on data availability in the future and, if so, to set up regulations with an appropriate degree of bindingness.\\n2. The study commissions are advised to reassess curricula to ensure appropriate consideration of the practical handling of research data as comprehensive course content in undergraduate and consecutive Masters programs.\\n3. Departments and research groups are advised to appoint research data contacts to enable institutional archiving of the research data at the University of Potsdam.\\n\\n\\n\\n# Illustrations\\n\\n4/5 Roese, Thomas.\\n\\n6/7 Network graphs of German-language dramas from DLINA Corpus (1731– 1929).

Datasets can also be valuable research outputs in their own right, and should be managed in such a way as to maximise their potential for use and impact.\\n\\nUniversity researchers are required to plan for data management, to collect and manage data responsibly during the research process, and to preserve and make accessible to the fullest extent possible data that substantiate research findings, considering any legal, ethical, commercial or practical restrictions that may apply. Wherever possible, data must be preserved and made accessible by means of an appropriate data repository, and in accordance with the FAIR Data Principles for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable research data.4\\n\\n## Scope and application\\n\\nThis policy covers all data collected or created under the authority of the University for the purposes of answering research questions. It includes any computer code created in research that is integral to the reproducibility of research results.\\n\\nThe policy applies to all researchers involved in collecting research data for or on behalf of the University, including researchers employed by the University, research students and visiting researchers. Data preservation and sharing requirements apply to undergraduate or taught postgraduate students if they are involved in research that results in the publication of peer-reviewed research outputs.\\n\\n## Responsibilities of researchers\\n\\nIt is the responsibility of researchers to ensure that research data are managed and shared in accordance with this policy and other relevant policy requirements.5\\n\\nResearchers are responsible for completing relevant training, including mandatory training for University employees in Information Security, Data Protection and Freedom of Information.6\\n\\nAll researchers involved in the handling of research data in a project should understand their roles and responsibilities, and should seek clarification of these from the Principal Investigator where necessary.\\n\\nPrincipal Investigators (including doctoral supervisors) are responsible for the management and sharing of research data collected in projects under their authority. They must ensure that the project complies with this policy and any other relevant policies, laws and contracts.\\n\\n## Data management planning\\n\\nA data management plan (DMP) should be created at the outset of any project that involves the collection of data, and maintained for the duration of the project. The DMP should describe the data that will be collected, how the data will be collected and managed during the project, and measures that will be taken to preserve and share data in line with FAIR Principles on completion of the research and publication of findings.\\n\\n### Grant applications and costs\\n\\nWhere a DMP is required as part of a grant application, it should be reviewed by the University’s Research Data Service prior to submission of the application.\\n\\nEquipment and infrastructure requirements for the collection, storage, processing and archiving of research data must be considered when developing proposals, and eligible costs should be included in grant applications.\\n\\n### Participant-based research\\n\\nWhere research involves participants, researchers must inform participants during recruitment of the intention to preserve and provide access to research data collected from them, unless for any reason it will not be possible to make data accessible to others. They must wherever possible plan to prepare data for sharing, usually by anonymisation, and identify an appropriate repository to deposit the data in, which may be an open data repository or one that can provide access to higher-risk data on a controlled basis.\\n\\n### Collaborations and research agreements\\n\\nWhere research is undertaken in collaboration with third parties, intellectual property rights in data, plans for data preservation and sharing, and legal responsibilities, for example in respect of personal data, must be agreed at the outset.\\n\\nCollaborative research agreements should recognise the broad objectives of this policy, and allow for the timely sharing of research data in support of project findings, while accommodating the legitimate interests of parties to the agreement.\\n\\n## Managing research data\\n\\nResearch data should be managed by researchers in accordance with a data management plan, following defined procedures for data storage and backup, file naming and organisation, version control, quality control, documentation and metadata creation.\\n\\nResearchers must store and process data securely using University-approved infrastructure in accordance with the University’s Information Compliance policies.\\n\\n### Preservation, sharing and disposal of data\\n\\nData that substantiate published research findings (including doctoral theses) or that have long-term value must be preserved and made accessible using a suitable data repository wherever possible in accordance with the FAIR Data Principles for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable research data, considering any legal, ethical, commercial or practical restrictions that may apply.\\n\\nData that are shared must be accompanied by sufficient documentation and relevant materials (such as code written to process data) to enable verification or reproduction of published results and re-use for research or other purposes.\\n\\nData collected from research participants should be shared wherever possible in anonymised form as open data or, in the case of higher-risk anonymised or identifiable data, by using a data repository that can hold and provide access to datasets under a controlled access procedure.\\n\\nWhere high volumes of data have been generated in the research, and it is not viable to deposit them in a data repository, they should where possible be held in University infrastructure. A metadata record describing the data should be published in the University’s Research Data Archive, so that they can be cited in related publications and interested parties can request access.\\n\\n### When data should be shared\\n\\nData supporting research findings must be made available no later than the date of first publication of research results, unless there is a legal, ethical, commercial or practical reason why data cannot be released at that time.\\n\\nDisclosure of data associated with commercial exploitation of research may be delayed while IP protection is sought. Once protection is in place, data should be shared.\\n\\n### Use of data repositories\\n\\nResearchers must use a data repository to preserve and share data wherever possible. The University recommends the use of disciplinary and data type-specific repositories where appropriate; but all University researchers have the option of using the University’s Research Data Archive.\\n\\nWhen a dataset has been deposited in a data repository external to the University or otherwise stored for preservation, the researcher should register the dataset with the University by creating a metadata record in the University’s Research Data Archive.\\n\\n### Formats and standards\\n\\nData should be preserved in open or widely-used file formats wherever possible, so that access is not dependent on purchase of a software licence. Data and associated metadata should be structured and described using relevant standards where these exist.\\n\\n## Rights and licensing\\n\\nData that are deposited in a data repository or disclosed to parties other than the members of the University and research collaborators must be accompanied by a rights statement identifying the owner(s) of intellectual property rights in the data, and a licence specifying the terms on which the data can be used.\\n\\nWherever possible, data should be made available under an open licence, such as the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) licence, in order to provide the broadest possible scope for re-use, unless legal obligations, third party rights, intellectual property rights or privacy rights preclude this.\\n\\nMore restrictive licences should be used where there is a well-founded reason to do so, for example, to protect commercial interests. Wherever possible in such cases a standard licence should be used, such as the Creative Commons AttributionNonCommercial (CC BY-NC) licence, which grants permission for use in research and teaching and other non-commercial activities.\\n\\n### Data availability statement and data citation\\n\\nAny publication based on the use of data must include a data availability statement citing the supporting dataset in the holding repository by means of its digital object identifier (DOI) or other unique identifier, or referencing any alternative storage location, and stating on what terms the data may be accessed. The full citation for the dataset should be provided in the publication’s list of references.\\n\\n### Preservation term\\n\\nRelevant data should be preserved for at least ten years after completion of a project, or for any longer minimum term specified in a funder’s policy.\\n\\n### Disposal of data\\n\\nData that do not substantiate published research findings and do not have long-term value should be disposed of when they no longer serve a purpose. Data that contain personal or confidential information must be disposed of securely in accordance with University guidelines.7\\n\\n## Intellectual Property Rights\\n\\nThe University has ownership of intellectual property rights (IPR) in research datasets created in the course of research undertaken by researchers in its employment, unless rights have been contractually assigned to another party.\\n\\nOwnership of IPR in a research dataset created by a student rests with the student, unless it has been assigned to another party under the terms of a contract of sponsorship or other agreement.\\n\\nWhere a dataset is the creation of more than one hand, IPR may be jointly held by more than one party.\\n\\nDisclosure of data, for example by deposit in a data repository, must be with the permission of all rights-holders and subject to any relevant authorisation, such as by a project’s Principal Investigator. Where the University is the rights-holder, disclosure of research data must be in compliance with the Code of Practice on Intellectual Property.8 Subject to the above conditions, University employees are empowered under this policy to disclose or authorise the disclosure of data collected by them for research purposes, unless a reason for restriction exists.\\n\\n## Support for research data management\\n\\nThe University provides infrastructure and services to support the effective storage, management, preservation and sharing of research data collected under its authority, in compliance with this policy and related policies and external requirements.\\n\\nThe University's Research Data Service promotes and supports good practice in research data management and compliance with this policy, and manages the University’s data repository, the University of Reading Research Data Archive.\\n\\nThe Research Data Service is based in the Research Engagement team in the Library. Contact details can be found on research data management website.9\\n\\n### Monitoring and compliance\\n\\nThe University will monitor compliance with this policy on the part of its researchers and may take appropriate action where cases of non-compliance are identified.\\n\\n### Responsibility and review\\n\\nResponsibility for the Research Data Management Policy sits with the Pro-ViceChancellor (Research and Innovation) and the University Board for Research and Innovation.\\n\\nThe Policy will be reviewed every three years.\\n\\n<html><body><table><tr><td>VERSION KEEPER</td><td></td><td>APPROVED</td><td>APPROVEDBY</td></tr><tr><td>1.0</td><td>Research Data Manager</td><td>2 March2015</td><td>UBRI</td></tr><tr><td>1.1</td><td>Research Data Manager</td><td>26September2017</td><td>ResearchDeanfor Environment</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>Research Data Manager</td><td>23 January 2024</td><td>UBRI</td></tr></table></body></html>\\n\\n## Guidance\\n\\n### Related policies and other requirements\\n\\nResearch data management is subject to some or all of the following policies and requirements:\\n\\nthe University’s Information Compliance policies, including inter alia the Data Protection, Encryption, Bring Your Own Device and Classification policies;10 the University’s Code of Practice on Intellectual Property;11\\nthe University’s Code of Good Practice in Research;12\\nany legal obligations, including those specified in the Freedom of Information Act 2000, the Environmental Information Regulations 2004, and the Data Protection Act 2018;13\\nany contractual obligations, such as the provisions of research agreements relating to the use and disclosure of intellectual property and publication of results; the data sharing policies of research funders.\\n\\n### Data management planning\\n\\nA data management plan (DMP) describes the data that will be collected in the course of a research project, how the data will be collected and managed, how relevant ethical and legal requirements will be met, and measures that will be taken to ensure the preservation and sharing of data on completion of the research and publication of findings. A DMP also defines data management roles and responsibilities within a research project.\\n\\nThe University provides guidance on data management planning, and can advise on and review DMPs on request.14\\n\\n### Grant applications and costs\\n\\nSome funders require researchers to submit a DMP or discuss how they will manage, preserve and share research data as part of the grant application. Where this is required, the Research Development Manager supporting the application will ensure that the DMP is reviewed by the Research Data Service before the application is submitted. The University provides information about the requirements of funders and guidance on preparing DMPs.15\\n\\nMany funders of research accept that data management costs are legitimate research expenses. Requirements for the collection, storage, processing and archiving of research data must be considered when developing proposals, and eligible costs should be included in grant applications. Any third-party suppliers used for the processing of data must be approved by the University.16\\n\\n### Participant-based research\\n\\nApplications for ethical review of research proposals submitted to the University Research Ethics Committee (UREC) and to some School Research Ethics Committees must be accompanied by a DMP describing the data to be collected, measures that will be taken to protect participants’ data, and plans for sharing of research data. The DMP will be reviewed by the relevant Research Ethics Committee, which may specify requirements for the proposed research to receive a favourable opinion.17\\n\\n### Planning for sharing of data collected from research participants\\n\\nWording that can be used to notify an intention to preserve and share data, either openly or under safeguards, is provided in the sample consent form provided by Information Management and Policy Services (IMPS). The IMPS Data Protection and Research guide provides guidance on anonymisation of research data.18\\n\\nIf data collected from participants are considered to be sensitive or higher-risk and not suitable for public sharing, they can be archived in some repositories under controlled access procedures. The UK Data Service ReShare can hold anonymised safeguarded data and the University’s Research Data Archive can accept restricted datasets, which may include identifiable and confidential information.19\\n\\n### Collaborations and research agreements\\n\\nStandard research agreements include provisions that support the objectives of this policy. Research Contracts will ensure the appropriate implementation of research agreements.20\\n\\n### Managing research data\\n\\nEffective management of research data according to a data management plan will increase the efficiency of the research process, safeguard against corruption or loss of data, and make it easier to prepare data for preservation and sharing at the end of the project.\\n\\nThe University’s research data management website provides guidance on managing research data, including data storage, data organisation, file formats, quality control, documentation and metadata, and online survey tools available through the University.21\\n\\n### Preservation, sharing and disposal of data\\n\\nPreservation and sharing of FAIR data entails:\\n\\nthe use of appropriate repository services to preserve, publish information about and provide access to the data; the use of open and widely-used standards to encode and describe the data; the use of open or other standard licences which define re-use permissions; the assignment to datasets of globally unique and persistent identifiers (such as a Digital Object Identifier or DOI), in order to enable citation, discovery and re-use.\\n\\nThe FAIR Principles are described in detail on the Go FAIR website.22\\n\\n### What data should be preserved and shared\\n\\nSufficient data and supporting information to enable verification or reproduction of the research results and meaningful re-use should be preserved. Documentation should include details of the methods and instruments used to collect and process the data, and interpretive metadata, which may be in the form of a data dictionary or codebook.\\n\\nWhile there may be legitimate legal and ethical reasons why some data cannot be shared, these can often be addressed by redaction of a dataset, for example to remove personal data, and/or by depositing data in a repository that provides access to data on a controlled basis (for example, subject to authorisation and under a data access agreement). Most data collected from participants can be preserved and shared on some basis. Researchers must inform participants of the intention to share data, either openly or under safeguards, during recruitment. Failure to do this is poor research practice.\\n\\nSharing of data obtained from and about Indigenous Peoples should respect Indigenous Peoples' rights and interests in their data and should be undertaken in accordance with the CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance.23\\n\\nSome areas of research, for example computational modelling, can generate large volumes of synthetic data. In such cases it may be more important - and more viable - to preserve the reproducibility of a method rather than a specific set of outputs, which might have little long-term value and be prohibitively expensive to maintain. It may be sufficient to preserve the code used to execute a model along with information about the input data used and the computing environment in which the model was run.\\n\\nGuidance on preserving and providing access to restricted and high-volume data is provided in the research data management website.24\\n\\n### When data should be shared\\n\\nResearchers are entitled to a limited period of privileged use of the data they have collected to enable them to publish the results of their research. Once the research findings are placed on public record, the evidence to support those findings must be made accessible unless a justifiable exemption applies.\\n\\nThe University provides assistance with the protection of intellectual property.25\\n\\n### Use of data repositories\\n\\nA data repository is a service that exists to preserve and provide access to research data. It supports the long-term management of and access to data in accordance with the FAIR Data Principles. Among other things a repository will:\\n\\napply data and metadata standards to support interoperability and re-use;\\npublish machine-readable metadata about a dataset to enable online discovery;\\nassign a persistent unique identifier, such as a DOI, to a dataset to make it citable and discoverable;\\npublish licence information to facilitate re-use.\\n\\nA data repository should be the preferred solution for data preservation and sharing. Sharing of raw data as supplementary information alongside the article on the publisher’s website should be avoided. It is not acceptable to retain data in closed storage, to be made available on request, except where there is a well-founded legal, ethical, commercial or practical reason for doing so.\\n\\nMost data collected from research participants can be deposited in a data repository either as anonymised open data, or, in the case of higher risk anonymised or identifiable data, by using a data repository that can hold and provide access to datasets under a controlled access procedure. For example, the UK Data Service can hold safeguarded data, and the University’s Research Data Archive can manage restricted datasets.\\n\\nData centres and repositories serving disciplinary communities and catering to specialised types of research data should be used where they are available and suitable. Requirements or preferences of funders should be taken into account when considering the most suitable place of deposit for research data. The University of Reading Research Data Archive can be used in most cases in the absence of a suitable external service.\\n\\nThe research data management website provides guidance on where to archive data26\\nand on depositing data in the University’s Research Data Archive.27\\n\\n### Formats and standards\\n\\nIf data have been stored in a proprietary format, researchers should convert the data into an open or widely-accessible file format for preservation purposes. The research data management website provides guidance on preparing data for archiving.28\\n\\nStandards are community-defined sets of requirements, specifications, or guidelines that can be used to encode, structure and describe data. Examples of standards are:\\n\\ndata models and associated formats for encoding specific types of data, e.g. the Network Common Data Form (NetCDF) standard for the numerical representation of scientific data, widely used in climate modelling, and the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) standard for organising neuroimaging and behavioural data; metadata standards for the structured description of data objects;29\\ncontrolled vocabularies;\\npersistent identifiers for entities, such as DOIs and ORCIDs.\\n\\nStandards are essential to the machine-actionability of data and metadata, and support discovery, access, interoperability and re-use in accordance with the FAIR Principles. Repositories may require submission of data and metadata in conformity with specified standards.\\n\\n### Rights and licensing\\n\\nThe University does not prescribe the use of a specific licence, but recommends the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) licence or one with similar permissions for open data. An Open Source licence such as Apache or GNU GPL can be used to share software code. Where there is a need to restrict permissions, standard licences should be used where possible. The Creative Commons suite of licences includes versions with non-commercial, no derivatives and share alike terms.\\n\\nThe research data management website provides guidance on licensing data30 and on publishing and licensing software code.31\\n\\n### Data availability statement and data citation\\n\\nThe research data management website provides guidance on data availability statements and data citation.32\\n\\nThe inclusion of a data availability statement in a publication is a requirement of the UKRI Open Access Policy.33\\n\\n### Preservation term\\n\\nMost data repositories undertake to hold datasets indefinitely. A minimum retention or preservation period may be specified in the repository’s policy.\\n\\nThe University’s Research Data Archive guarantees a minimum retention term of ten years, but is committed to the long-term preservation of research data. A dataset would only ordinarily be in scope for deletion if it had not been accessed for ten years. Datasets may be removed for other reasons, for example, if they are found to be in breach of the law or the rights of other parties. If a dataset is withdrawn from a repository, a ‘tombstone’ metadata record will be retained to preserve a citable record of the dataset.\\n\\n### Disposal of data\\n\\nIMPS provides guidelines for the retention and disposal of records.34\\n\\n## Intellectual Property Rights\\n\\nFurther information is provided in the Code of Practice on Intellectual Property.35\\n\\nResearchers who leave the University should ensure that any data belonging to the University are handed over to an appropriate data steward, such as their line manager, or, in default of any other person, the Head of School.\\n\\n## Support for research data management\\n\\nThe Research Data Service promotes good research data management practice through the provision of information, support and training; supports data management planning for research funding applications; manages the University’s data repository, the Research Data Archive; and monitors and supports compliance with this policy.\\n\\nThe Research Data Manager works with the Committee on Open Research and Research Integrity, the Committee for Research Infrastructure, relevant professional services and members of the research community to ensure that research data management is integrated into University policy and infrastructure.\\n\\n# Glossary\\n\\nData repository: a service that provides long-term preservation of and access to research data in accordance with the FAIR Data Principles.

All researchers are responsible for managing their research data in accordance with contractual, legislative, regulatory, ethical, and other specified requirements and as set out in the project’s Data Management Plan (see 4.3).\\n\\n### 4.2 Accountability\\n\\nThe lead researcher (Principal Investigator or equivalent) on a research project is primarily accountable for RDM practices within the project. They must ensure that all research data are generated, stored, managed, and shared in accordance with contractual, legislative, regulatory, ethical, and other specified requirements, including any funder policies.\\n\\n4.2.1. The lead researcher must ensure that, where external partners are involved, research data ownership is established and confirmed contractually in advance of a research project starting, in accordance with the University\\'s Intellectual Property Policy and relevant third-party agreements. They must ensure that any access to research data by third parties is managed in accordance with the Information Security Policy.\\n\\n4.2.2. Postgraduate research students are primarily accountable for RDM practices within their project. Supervisors of research students are responsible for ensuring that their students are adequately trained and have a clear understanding of RDM requirements and appropriate practice.\\n\\n4.2.3. RDM responsibilities can be shared or delegated but should be clearly documented in a Data Management Plan, and the lead researcher retains overall accountability. If leaving the University they must nominate a data steward, recorded in the Data Management Plan, to ensure the ongoing management, retention, and timely destruction of research data.\\n\\n### 4.3 Data Management Plans\\n\\nThe lead researcher must ensure a Data Management Plan (DMP) is created for every research project which sets out how research data will be collected, classified, protected, prepared, securely stored, retained, and, wherever possible, shared. The DMP must be created before the beginning of the research project, typically at the funding application or ethical approval stage. DMPs are living documents which must be reviewed and kept up to date throughout the project. All members of the research project team must be aware of, and abide by, the DMP.\\n\\n### 4.4 Protecting sensitive data\\n\\nResearchers must protect sensitive data and the rights of research participants in accordance with legislation, contractual agreements, and ethical requirements.\\n\\n4.4.1.  Sensitive and confidential research data can be shared ethically and legally when this has been planned and agreed before collection, following relevant professional, ethical and discipline-specific standards. These include, but are not limited to, gaining informed consent from participants; protecting identities through anonymisation or pseudonymisation; and controlling access to data where necessary.\\n\\n### 4.5 Costs\\n\\nWhen developing a research funding application, researchers must include appropriate research data storage and retention costs, including any costs associated with the digitisation of physical research data. Where a project is not in receipt of external research funding, research data storage needs should be identified at the outset and, if these exceed the allowance provided by the University, suitable arrangements made to cover any additional costs.\\n\\n### 4.6 Storage during the project\\n\\nWhile in active use, researchers must ensure that research data are stored safely, securely and protected from loss using facilities appropriate to the data medium.\\n\\n4.6.1. Researchers must store digital research data on secure digital systems with a back-up mechanism to protect against loss. Where, due to the circumstances of data collection, research data needs to be temporarily stored on mobile devices or external storage, data classified as confidential must be encrypted and in all cases researchers must ensure data security in line with the Information Security policy.\\n\\n4.6.2. The loss of sensitive data or University IT equipment must be reported according to the ICT Acceptable Use Policy.\\n\\n### 4.7 Retention\\n\\nResearchers are responsible for selecting which research data to retain by considering potential long-term value, reproducibility of the research findings, and legal or funder requirements. Selected research data must be retained for at least any period stipulated by legal, contractual, regulatory, or ethical requirements, and in line with disciplinespecific norms, typically at least 10 years from publication.\\n\\n### 4.8 Depositing research data\\n\\nResearchers must deposit their selected research data in an appropriate data repository as soon as possible. Researchers may choose to use Figshare, the research data storage service provided by the University, or an alternative data repository which complies with legal, regulatory, and ethical requirements and aligns with FAIR principles to ensure data are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable. Access to deposited data can be restricted where necessary.\\n\\n4.8.1. Where research data are deposited in a repository other than the University’s data storage service, researchers must enter a metadata record into the University of Salford Institutional Repository (USIR).\\n4.8.2. Where research data selected for retention are not in digital format, they should be digitised where possible. Where digitisation is not possible, researchers should seek to store the data in facilities appropriate to the subject matter and medium. To ensure these data are discoverable, a metadata record should be added to the University of Salford Institutional Repository (USIR).\\n\\n### 4.9 Preparation of data\\n\\nResearchers are responsible for preparing data prior to deposit and/or sharing. Before depositing research data, researchers must ensure that any sensitive data are prepared and protected in accordance with the consent given by participants, and any legal, contractual, regulatory, or ethical requirements (see 4.4).\\n\\n4.9.1. Research data held in any repository must be accompanied by metadata that clearly describe the data in sufficient detail to allow other researchers to find and understand them.\\n4.9.2. Where research data have been made openly accessible, they should be accompanied by sufficient descriptive and technical metadata and documentation to enable reading, reuse, and interoperation by humans and machines.\\n\\n### 4.10 Data sharing\\n\\nResearch data selected for deposit must be made as open as possible and only as restricted as necessary. To enable open data sharing and maximise reuse and reproducibility, researchers should choose the most permissive Creative Commons licence possible (e.g. CC 0 licence). Researchers should minimise the period of time for which they hold exclusive use of the data, as allowed by ethical, legislative, regulatory, commercial, and contractual conditions.\\n\\n### 4.11 Data underpinning publications\\n\\nA data access statement describing where supporting data can be found and accessed must be included in the publication when mandated by the research funder or publisher, even where the study generated no original research data, or the data are restricted or otherwise not accessible. In all other cases, a data access statement is strongly encouraged. Research data that underpins published research findings should, where possible, be made openly available at the time of first online publication.\\n\\n### 4.12 Data underpinning theses\\n\\nWhere postgraduate research students have created or collected original research data which underpins the findings of their research, and these are not included in the thesis itself, they should ensure that selected data is stored in accordance with this policy. Research students are strongly encouraged to add a data access statement to the thesis. This statement should describe where supporting data can be found and accessed, even where the data are restricted or otherwise not accessible. Guidance is set out in the PGR Code of Practice.\\n\\n### 4.13 Disposal of data\\n\\nResearchers, or research data stewards, must securely dispose of research data identified for deletion or destruction with particular concern for the confidentiality and security of the data, in accordance with legal, contractual, regulatory, or ethical requirements and the University’s Information Security Policy.\\n\\n### University responsibilities:\\n\\n### 4.14 Research data storage service\\n\\nThe University will provide a digital research data storage service which complies with legal, regulatory, ethical, and information security requirements. Research data in the University\\'s research data storage service, Figshare, will be retained for the length of time detailed in the data management plan.\\n\\n4.14.1. Where research data selected for long-term retention are not in digital format and cannot be digitised, the University will support researchers to identify facilities and resources required for preservation within the data management plan.\\n\\n### 4.15 Guidance, training and support\\n\\nThe University will provide support, guidance and training for researchers to enable effective research data management throughout the research lifecycle.\\n\\nUniversity of Salford\\n\\n## 5.0 Policy Enforcement and Monitoring\\n\\nBreach of this policy will be considered as having the potential to bring the University and its employees into disrepute and managed in that context. Specific processes will be brought to bear in this context, including the Research Misconduct Policy and Procedure, the Academic Misconduct Procedure, and the Disciplinary Policy.\\n\\nPeriodic monitoring against this policy will be undertaken by The Library and Research and Knowledge Exchange (RKE) and be reported to the Research Enterprise & Innovation Committee (REIC).\\n\\n## 6.0 Related Documentation\\n\\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Internal Websites (the Hub)</td></tr><tr><td>AcademicsEthicsStaffwebsite</td></tr><tr><td>AcademicHandbook</td></tr><tr><td>AcademicRegulationsforResearchAwards</td></tr><tr><td>CodeofPracticefortheConductofPostgraduateResearchDegreeProgrammes</td></tr><tr><td>ConcordattoSupport ResearchIntegrity</td></tr><tr><td>InformationGovernancewebsite</td></tr><tr><td>QualityManagementOffice</td></tr><tr><td>ResearchDataManagement</td></tr><tr><td>ResearchPolicy</td></tr><tr><td>SenateandCommitteeswebsite</td></tr><tr><td>StudentFacingProcedureswebsite</td></tr><tr><td>Policies and Procedures (all internal)</td></tr><tr><td>Academic Ethics Policy</td></tr><tr><td>AcademicMisconduct Procedure</td></tr><tr><td>Datadepositoragreement</td></tr><tr><td>DataProtectionPolicy</td></tr><tr><td>DisciplinaryPolicy</td></tr><tr><td>ICT Acceptable Use Policy</td></tr><tr><td>Information SecurityPolicy</td></tr><tr><td>IntellectualPropertyPolicy(underreview)</td></tr><tr><td>ResearchMisconductPolicyandProcedure</td></tr><tr><td>RecordsRetentionSchedule</td></tr><tr><td>ResearchCodeofPractice</td></tr></table></body></html>\\n\\n<html><body><table><tr><td>SafeguardingGuidanceforResearch</td></tr><tr><td>SchemeofAcademicGovernance</td></tr><tr><td>UniversityEthicsFramework</td></tr><tr><td>Terms of Reference</td></tr><tr><td>AcademicEthics&ResearchIntegrityCommittee</td></tr><tr><td>Governance, Nominations, and Ethics Committee</td></tr><tr><td>Research,Enterprise&InnovationCommittee</td></tr><tr><td>SchoolEthicsApprovalCommittee</td></tr><tr><td>School Research, Enterprise and Engagement EthicsApproval Panel</td></tr><tr><td>Related external legislation, policies and information</td></tr><tr><td>DataProtectionAct(2018)</td></tr><tr><td>National Security in ResearchPolicy</td></tr><tr><td>Go FAIR-FAIR DataPrinciples</td></tr></table></body></html>\\n\\n## 7.0 Contact\\n\\na.

       " '# University of South Wales Prifysgol De Cymru\\n\\nResearch Data Management Policy\\n\\n## Position Statement\\n\\nThe University of South Wales acknowledges and endorses the Research Council UK’s Common Principles on Data Policy statement1 that publicly funded research data are a public good, produced in the public interest, which should be made openly available with as few restrictions as possible in a timely and responsible manner that does not harm intellectual property.  For the purpose of this policy, the term “research data” is clarified as information gathered through the pursuit of research activity. Such information may be in a variety of forms including quantitative data, interview recordings or transcripts, video or audio recordings.\\n\\nResearch data management is of strategic importance to the university. The university provides an effective, safe and sustainable working environment, has developed appropriate policies and approaches based on current research lifecycle processes and expected best practice. Good research data management is important for securing research funding and we are keen to minimise risks associated with poor research data management.\\n\\n# Coverage\\n\\nThe following policy on Research Data Management applies to all research active staff and students. It needs to be acknowledged that this is an aspirational policy, and that implementation will take time. As a result the university will endeavour to manage research data to the highest standard throughout the research data lifecycle as part of the University’s commitment to research excellence.\\n\\n# Institutional Responsibility\\n\\nThe University will work to provide mechanisms where no appropriate subject or publisher repository exists for the storage, backup, registration, deposit and retention of research data assets in support of current and future access, during and after completion of research projects.\\nThe University will work to provide training, support, advice and, where appropriate guidelines and templates for the research data management and research data\\nmanagement plans.\\n\\n## Researcher Responsibility\\n\\nDirect responsibility for future research data management lies primarily with Principal Investigators who must ensure that data that has not been generated in a digital format is converted and stored in a timely manner.\\n\\nData Management/Sharing Plans All new research funding proposals must include research data management/ sharing plans that clearly address data capture, management, integrity, confidentiality and intellectual property, retention, sharing and publication.\\n• If any 3rd party data has been used, you must consider whether copyright clearance is necessary. You should ensure that you have obtained permission from the rights holder in writing before sharing or developing further data. Personal data must be processed in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998. The legitimate interests of the subjects of research data must be protected in line with the appropriate USW policy. Research data management/sharing plans must ensure that research data are available for access and re-use where appropriate and under appropriate safeguards. Researchers are encouraged to create data in an appropriate digital format wherever possible, in order to facilitate data re-use (open-by-default). Any data which is retained elsewhere, for example in an international data service or repository should be registered with the University of South Wales, along with the appropriate metadata. Research data that represent records of the University, including data that substantiate research findings, should be offered for deposit and retention in an appropriate national or international data service or repository where possible. Exclusive rights to reuse or publish research data should not be handed over to commercial publishers or agents without retaining the rights to make the data openly available for reuse, unless this is a condition of funding.\\nFurther Information\\n\\nMore detailed guidance and resources can be found on the University of South Wales Research Data Management toolkit.

This applies equally to all disciplines.\\n\\n1.3. The purpose of research data management is to ensure that research data is managed according to good practices for collection, curation, storage, management, retrieval, re-use, sharing, archiving, preservation and access, as appropriate for the data and discipline concerned, to support researchers to:\\n\\n1.3.1. maximise the academic value of research data;\\n\\n1.3.2. meet the expectations set out in the University's relevant policy and guidance (see Section 2.3);\\n1.3.3. comply with any applicable requirements of funding agencies and other stakeholders;\\n1.3.4. where personal data is involved, protect the privacy of research participants by safeguarding their data; and\\n1.3.5. follow the FAIR guiding principles for data management and stewardship.\\n\\n1.4. The University expects that all research data will over time be made publicly available wherever possible consistent with any constraints necessary to meet funding requirements, statutory or ethical responsibilities, and as appropriate to the field or discipline. Our guiding principle is ‘as open as possible, as closed as necessary’.\\n\\n1.5. Data should, whenever possible, be deposited into an appropriate long-term archive. Such archives include national or international subject-specific archives, secure repositories for data with extreme confidentiality requirements, or a managed University repository (e.g. Pure). For the personal data of study participants, the measures indicated on the relevant ethical application form and communicated to the study participants must be adhered to when depositing data in a repository.\\n\\n1.6. Data underpinning publications should be made openly available wherever possible, with explicit Data Access Statements provided in publications. Data should have persistent identifiers to support citations, and be accompanied by rich metadata (including a description) to increase discoverability as recommended by the FAIR principles (paragraph 1.3.5).\\n\\n1.7. All research articles must include a Data Access Statement. Statements should enable citation of underpinning research data by providing a location with a unique identifier (DOI) and any terms of access. When there are no data associated with the article or the data are inaccessible a Data Access Statement must still be included stating the reason(s) why the data cannot be made available.\\n\\n1.8. The University will maintain a central catalogue of metadata descriptions for indexing, archiving, naming, and retrieval of datasets and other objects, and will register the DOI or other stable name of all objects being managed to support uniform treatment.\\n\\n## 2. Scope and responsibilities\\n\\n2.1. This policy applies to all researchers and research data as defined in Section 3. This policy applies to all research irrespective of funding.\\n\\n2.2. Within its statutory and other requirements, the University seeks to leave as much control over the data lifecycle with the researchers concerned.\\n\\n### 2.3. Researchers:\\n\\n2.3.1. Should develop a data management plan for the data to be collected and securely managed; protecting individuals and the University from accidental or malicious data loss. Such plans should include issues of confidentiality, retention, sharing, publication, preservation and open access, and describe how the collection of data and metadata will be integrated into their everyday research processes so as to make compliance with the data management plan, ethics requirements and legislation as simple as possible;\\n\\n2.3.2. Should allocate appropriate resources (time and financial resources) for research data management in grant proposals;\\n\\n2.3.3. Should deposit their data in accordance with this Policy (see Section 1.5); and\\n\\n2.3.4. Must act in accordance with other relevant University policies, referring to relevant guidance where provided: the Principles of Good Research Conduct, Data Protection policy, and Information Classification Policy.\\n\\nRelated policy and guidance:\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n2.4. Principal Investigators/Group leaders/Supervisors should ensure that they and the researchers they manage receive appropriate induction, training and support in the handling, curation and archiving of research data and that the expectations set in this policy are met.\\n\\n2.5. Heads of School should provide oversight of data management within their Schools.\\n\\n2.6. The University has a responsibility to ensure that systems are in place to support and reinforce good research data management. The University will provide:\\n\\n2.6.1. Advice and guidance on the management of personal and otherwise sensitive data in line with legislation and how legislation supports academic research Contact: dataprot@st-andrews.ac.uk\\n\\n2.6.2.

Rights associated with research data 11\\nAppendix A – Glossary of Terms 12\\n\\n### 1. Introduction\\n\\nThe University of Strathclyde (hereafter ‘the University’) believes that the highest standards of research quality and integrity are facilitated by the application of good practice in research data management and sharing (RDMS). The creation of and provision for data resources (i.e. digital data/files and analogue data) at research institutions is central to maintaining a progressive research environment. Research funders are also setting increasingly ambitious research data management and sharing expectations for Researchers and their institutions. This is in furtherance of their broader open research goals, particularly in promoting superior transparency of research findings (e.g. verification, reproducibility and replicability). Such a trend has therefore become reputational and is reflected in a growing number of scholarly journals and communities of practice, many of which mandate openness and sharing of any data accompanying publications.\\n\\nResearch data processed by University Researchers (as defined in 1.2) is expected to be managed to a high standard throughout the research data lifecycle in support of the University’s Strategic Plan; to avoid data loss, contractual and/or data protection breaches; and to widely share the evidence which underpins research, for societal and public benefit. The University supports Researchers to achieve excellence through the provision of systems, infrastructure, tools, training and guidance via our cross-functional Research Data Management and Sharing (RDMS) Service.\\n\\n#### 1.1 Purpose of the policy\\n\\nThis policy provides key definitions, principles, policy and operational requirements of research data management and sharing along with an explanation of rights relating to research data. The purpose of this policy is to ensure that Researchers manage their research data effectively, enabling them to:\\n\\nComply with ethical, legal, funder and other requirements in relation to data and data management.\\n• Preserve eligible data for reuse within and outside of the University (as appropriate).\\n• Demonstrate the integrity of their research.\\n\\nThis Policy aligns with wider requirements and policies relating to research data management and sharing. This includes: University research policies (e.g. the Research Code of Practice and the Code of Practice for Postgraduate Research Students); external research-related concordats and agreements to which the University is committed (e.g. Concordat to Support Research Integrity and Concordat on Open Research Data); and funder and publisher requirements (e.g. UKRI research data policies and Open Access Policy).\\n\\n#### 1.2 Key definitions\\n\\nKey definitions for the terms ‘Researcher’, ‘research data’ and ‘research data management and sharing’ are provided here. A full glossary of terms is provided in Appendix A.\\n\\n#### Researcher\\n\\nThroughout the policy, the term ‘Researcher’ is used to refer to:\\n\\n(i) University staff (whether holding employment or worker contracts) involved in the creation, collection, generation or processing of research data.\\n(ii) Postgraduate Researchers (PGR) involved in the creation, collection, generation or processing of research data.\\n(iii) Individuals who do not fall within (i) and (ii) above but who are otherwise associated with the University and are authorised to use the University’s name, facilities and/or services when involved in the creation, collection, generation or processing of research data (such persons would include, for example, those holding visiting, honorary or emeritus status).\\n\\nWhere expectations and requirements for Researchers differ by the role they hold (e.g. Principal Investigator, Postgraduate Researcher (PGR), or Supervisor) this is noted in Section 3. Nonetheless, each Researcher has a responsibility for the research data they are collecting and processing.\\n\\nThis policy does not apply to Undergraduate Students and Postgraduate Taught Students. The Intellectual Property issues associated with involving these students in research projects are addressed in ANNEX B of the Intellectual Property (IP) & Commercialisation policy.\\n\\n#### Research data\\n\\nThe definition of ‘research data’ for the purpose of this policy is digital or analogue (i.e. represented in a physical way) information that is created, collected, and/or reused to produce, validate and/or enrich research findings.\\n\\n‘Research data’ therefore includes:\\n\\nData collected through any methodology (e.g. by experimentation, observation, modelling, interview or other methods)\\nData obtained from existing sources\\nQuantitative data\\nQualitative data\\nRaw or primary data (e.g. direct from measurement or collection)\\nData derived from primary data for subsequent analysis or interpretation (e.g. as an extract of a larger dataset)\\nData derived from existing sources where the rights may be held by others.\\n\\n### Research data management and sharing\\n\\n‘Research data management and sharing’ refers to the collection, organisation, storage, sharing and preservation of data throughout a research project and forms a key component of ensuring research integrity.\\n\\n‘Research data management and sharing’ covers:\\n\\nInitial planning, routine processes for data (file) management and organisation (e.g. back-up processes; folder and file-naming systems; version-control strategies; quality control measures; data documentation). Consolidation and incorporation of any contractual matters relating to the research (e.g. collaborative research terms stipulated in a collaboration agreement, Material Transfer Agreement or similar). Observance of appropriate ethical, legal and professional frameworks, obligations and standards, including conditions of ethical approval. • Long-term archiving, removal, restriction and/or sharing of data.\\n\\n### 1.3 Scope of the Policy\\n\\nThis policy applies to all research data processed by Researchers in the course of their activities at the University. The specific requirements for Researchers will differ according to the nature of the project and whether the project is funded. Research data subject to funder, regulatory and contractual requirements must be managed according to those requirements and any exceptions should be approved by the sponsor, funder or relevant authority.\\n\\nThis policy outlines expectations on Researchers regarding best practice in research data management and sharing. Aspects of the policy which are mandatory are differentiated using the word ‘must’. The guidance associated with this policy details best practice for data storage, sharing and the preservation of data and provides examples of what is appropriate, proportionate and realistic.\\n\\n### 2. Principles of research data management and sharing\\n\\nIn recognition that not all research data can be shared openly, the University’s approach to assessing the suitability of data for sharing is that data should be ‘as open as possible and as closed as necessary’. This means that data should be ‘open’ in order to foster reusability and to accelerate research, but ‘closed’ when required by legal, ethical, security and/or commercial constraints or if considered necessary to safeguard the safety and wellbeing of those involved in the research. In line with the University’s strategic commitment to progress towards FAIR open data policies, whenever possible data and/or descriptive metadata produced by the University should be:\\n\\nFindable: easy to find for both humans and computers.\\nAccessible: accompanied by clear instructions for access and authorisation.\\nInteroperable: can be integrated with other data and/or work in conjunction with applications or workflows for analysis, storage and processing.\\nReusable: suitably described to allow further use, released with a clear and accessible data usage licence.\\n\\nThese FAIR data principles are regarded as a key element of good research data management and sharing practice by offering both Researchers and research institutions a standardised framework for the creation and stewardship of research data.\\n\\n### 3. Policy requirements\\n\\nWhen conducting research, Researchers are responsible for managing the data they create, collect and process. In general, overall responsibility for data management rests with the Principal Investigator of a project or study. Similarly, Postgraduate Researchers are responsible for managing the data they create, collect and process, with support and guidance to be provided by Supervisors. However, the Primary Supervisor has overall responsibility for ensuring that all research is organised and undertaken within a framework of best practice, as stated in the Code of Practice for Postgraduate Research Students.\\n\\nAll Researchers can access support in relation to compliance with external and University research data management and sharing requirements, including the requirements in this Policy, from the Research Data Management and Sharing (RDMS) service. Support for ethical matters can be sought from the University Ethics Committee; support for contractual matters can be sought from Grants and Contracts Team in RKES.\\n\\n#### 3.1 Researchers should ensure research data is managed responsibly and must adhere to ethical, legal, funder and other mandated requirements.\\n\\n3.1.1 All Researchers are expected to familiarise themselves with University research data management and sharing requirements and solutions, as well as disciplinary tools and infrastructure, including all costs, terms, and conditions governing their research. This includes being aware of and adhering to all relevant legislation and policies concerning data protection, copyright and Intellectual Property (IP) as outlined in Section 4.\\n\\n3.1.2 Principal Investigators must be aware of University and funder data requirements/terms and conditions of award; any project-related contractual and/or ethical agreements, and organise and direct data management activities, systems, and services accordingly. Principal Investigators should ensure all Researchers in the project team are aware of research data management and sharing policies and data requirements, as well as any contractual agreements which may impact on research data (for example, where there is a confidentiality agreement, which would necessitate a restriction or embargo to the release of data).\\n\\n3.1.3 Postgraduate Researchers are expected to be familiar with relevant, University and funder data policies and requirements, and best practice in their discipline.\\n\\n3.1.4 All Supervisors of Postgraduate Researchers are expected to provide support and guidance to supervisees. The Primary Supervisor must ensure supervisees are aware of research data management and sharing policies and data requirements, as well as any contractual agreements which may impact on research data (for example, where there is a confidentiality agreement, which would necessitate a restriction or embargo to the release of data).\\n\\n3.1.5 As a means to ensure the responsible management of research data, all student (PGR) and staff research projects are required to have a Data Management Plan (DMP) in place prior to the commencement of research (termed the ‘Provisional DMP’)1. This applies to all research projects regardless of whether there are funder data requirements/terms and conditions of awards. The Provisional DMP should document key decisions concerning data collection, storage, sharing and preservation (including what is and is not appropriate to share), and be kept up to date during the course of the project. As outlined in Section 4, in the interests of transparency and to enable monitoring of research data management and sharing practice, a copy of both the Provisional DMP and the version in place at project completion (termed the ‘Final DMP’) should be uploaded to the Data Management Plan inbox. These DMP documents will be retained for the same period as the associated research data (see section 4.6). If there is no associated research data, the documentation will be retained for three years following project completion to inform policy and guidance.\\n\\n#### 3.2 Research data should be made openly available where possible, in a timely and responsible manner and any restrictions should be minimised and justified.\\n\\n3.2.1 All Researchers should seek to make data ‘as open as possible, as closed as necessary’, respecting any necessary restrictions on research data sharing due to legal, ethical, security and/or commercial constraints or safety concerns, and support the preparation and preservation of data in the most appropriate manner. Where appropriate, consent for data sharing should be sought from research participants at the outset, and considered as part of the ethical approval process.\\n\\n3.2.2 Principal Investigators are responsible for assessing the suitability of data for public sharing, in line with any external and University research data management and sharing requirements. It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator to ensure that data is prepared and preserved via data deposit in Pure or an external repository subject to the appropriate restrictions, license and re-use agreements. As outlined in Section 4, where an external repository is used, a metadata record must be created in Pure.\\n\\n3.2.3 For Postgraduate Research projects, decisions about the suitability for sharing/publication, and future reuse of research data, should be taken jointly between the Postgraduate Researcher and the Primary Supervisor, in consideration of any ethics and/or project collaboration agreements and commercialisation issues, as well as funder data policy/requirements and University policy. The Primary Supervisor is ultimately responsible for ensuring that data is prepared and preserved via data deposit in Pure or an external repository subject to the appropriate restrictions, license and re-use agreements, though it is expected to be the Postgraduate Researcher who completes these tasks. As outlined in Section 4, where an external repository is used, a metadata record must be created in Pure.\\n\\n#### 3.3 Researchers should ensure that appropriate records are kept to demonstrate the integrity of their research.\\n\\n3.3.1 Proper research data management is a key part of ensuring the integrity of the research record. All Researchers should maintain a robust and reliable audit trail, which can be followed to establish the authenticity of any discovery or invention and to defend the results of genuine research endeavour.\\n\\n3.3.2 Principal Investigators are responsible for ensuring that record-keeping is sufficient to demonstrate the quality, consistency and authenticity of the research. Examples of good record-keeping in research include retaining master copies of data, and applying a systemic version-control strategy for subsequent versions (iterations); appropriately marking-up revisions – without deleting content; developing a Data Management Plan to document ongoing decisions about data (file) management; and employing robust quality-control procedures.\\n\\n3.3.3 For Postgraduate Research projects, data management decisions must be recorded in a Data Management Plan (see Section 4), as stated in the Code of Practice for Postgraduate Research Students. It is the responsibility of the Postgraduate Researcher to maintain records in order to demonstrate the integrity of their research to their Supervisory Team, to examiners and to the wider academic community once published.\\n\\n3.3.4 For Staff research projects which are collecting, generating and/or using data, data management decisions must be recorded in a Data Management Plan in accordance with University/Funder policies (if applicable) and sector best practice.\\n\\n### 4. Operational requirements\\n\\nThe following operational requirements, which flow from the policy requirements in Section 3, are outlined to support Researchers to meet the principles and requirements related to research data management and to ensure research data are managed and disseminated in accordance with good research practice.\\n\\n#### 4.1 Research projects working with research data are expected to create a project Data Management Plan (DMP) and data management costs should be factored into project applications as part of the grant submission process.\\n\\n4.1.1 In accordance with University/funder policies and sector best practice, all student (PGR) and staff research projects are required to have a DMP. As outlined in 3.1.5, a Provisional DMP should be in place prior to project commencement and updates should be made as required over the course of the project (treating it as a ‘living’ document), resulting in a Final DMP on project completion. The DMP should document key decisions concerning data collection, storage, sharing and preservation as appropriate to the project and in accordance with applicable funder data requirements and/or contractual/ethical agreements. In the interests of transparency and to enable monitoring of research data management and sharing practice, a copy of the Provisional DMP should be uploaded to the Data Management Plan inbox prior to project commencement and the Final DMP (reflecting any decisions/updates made during the project) should be similarly submitted once the project is complete.\\n\\n4.1.2 If the required resources to ensure effective research data management and sharing are not already available, these should be costed into project applications as appropriate. Researchers should consider costs that will be directly incurred, for example, researcher time to prepare data for preservation. Some research funders will cover expenses and costs relating to data management activities, if fully justified at application stage; for example, UKRI guidance states that ‘Support may be requested for any costs related to research data management which will be incurred during the project and not be covered by directly allocated or indirect costs.’2 Guidance on costing research projects can be sought from the Costing and Pricing Team in RKES.\\n\\n4.1.3 Researchers can use the University’s generic DMP template, which contains local information and prompts. Tailored templates, such as those that adhere to funder requirements, can be found on DMP Online. When applying for funding grants and bids, Researchers are likely to be asked to structure the DMP to fit the funder or scheme-specific template.\\n\\n4.1.4 Researchers can upload draft DMPs to the DMP Inbox for review and feedback. To assist Researchers with preparing a plan, there are also Data Management Plan tips on the RDMS website; training is available; and one-to-one meetings can be arranged to discuss data management planning for individual projects (requests should be made via email to researchdataprojects@strath.ac.uk).\\n\\n#### 4.2 Arrangements for the long-term storage of large datasets should be factored into data management planning and costed into grant applications where appropriate.\\n\\n4.2.1 A decision on the long-term storage of large datasets will be assessed when offered for deposit. Datasets are considered large if they cannot be adequately dealt with by traditional data processing applications and infrastructure due to their size and complexity.\\n\\n4.2.2 If the research outputs from a funded project are expected to include very large datasets, this should be identified and costed at the DMP and grant application stage. This information will support RDMS Service decisions on storing and archiving large datasets.\\n\\n4.2.3 Very large data can be deposited in Pure on condition that it is appropriately packaged and documented. No individual files should exceed 20GB. FAIR consideration for re-use should ensure the data is accessible from the Pure Knowledgebase. Extremely large datasets may be held off-line in exceptional circumstances, in bespoke storage locations operated by the RDMS Service.\\n\\n4.2.4  Storing the files in such bespoke storage locations is not conducive to FAIR data principles, negatively impacting the findability and accessibility of the data. Planning at an early stage with the DMP will mitigate this possibility including any compliance requirements pertaining to data accessibility, and identify cases where the size of the data means that such bespoke storage locations become necessary.\\n\\n4.2.5  Projects must contact RDMS support to discuss the deposit of very large data, ideally at the DMP and deposit stages.\\n\\n4.3 Rights, licences, ownership and ethical considerations related to research data should be recognised and agreed at the earliest opportunity within a project.\\n\\n4.3.1 Where research involves collaboration with external parties/partners, Strathclyde Researchers must seek advice from Grants and Contract staff in RKES to arrange an appropriate contract and/or collaboration/consortia-type agreement that clearly records the rights each party possess and permissions each party provides to ensure research data can be used for current and future research.\\n\\n4.3.2 Data should be deposited with a clear license on the reuse of data. License options are available when finalising deposits in Pure. CC-BY is the preferred license for open data, which allows data users to copy, modify and distribute data in any format for any purpose, including commercial use, provided they acknowledge the data creators and give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made.\\n\\n4.3.3 Not all research data are suitable for open/public sharing, for example, research data containing protectable intellectual property or ‘personal data’ about research participants. In such cases, Researchers are encouraged to contact RDMS staff to discuss the most appropriate options for the data. Licence and re-use agreements can be tailored according to project requirements.\\n\\n#### 4.4 Research data must be securely stored and managed throughout the time period they are retained.\\n\\n4.4.1 The University will identify active storage systems, which are suitable for storage of data during the active phase of research (while a project is ongoing), and long-term preservation systems, which are suitable for storage of data after a project has completed. Decisions on which storage systems are considered suitable for each phase will be taken by the University’s RDMS staff, and kept under regular review. These decisions will be taken in consultation with IS Infrastructure staff, and communicated to researchers.3\\n\\n4.4.2 Whilst a project is ongoing, research data should be securely stored on resilient, robust University active storage systems, and managed in line with the associated DMP. However, data should not be stored long-term on these systems. Data/files held on active storage platforms, such as Departmental/School i: drives, are not subject to the same preservation measures as they are when deposited in Pure (or another data repository). Moreover, data/files held in storage, linked to an individual’s DS login account (e.g., H: drive; Strathcloud personal folders; OneDrive for Business, etc.) will be deleted if/when the staff member/student leaves/graduates from the University.\\n\\n4.4.3 Following project completion, data should be archived for long term accessibility, curation and preservation in a suitable long-term preservation system. When data are deposited in Pure - as a dataset - they are catalogued, associated with metadata, assigned a persistent link/DOI, and are subject to preservation activity by Library staff, and thereafter retained for a minimum period of 10- years. Completed datasets deposited in Pure are additionally processed using the Archivematica Digital Preservation system.\\n\\n4.4.4 Once the project has completed, and the completed data has been stored on a suitable long-term preservation system, the data on the active storage system must be reviewed and deleted if it is no longer required on that system.  Decisions around deletion of data from the active store must recognise the significant ongoing financial cost to the University, and the environmental impact, of retaining data in the active store unnecessarily.\\n\\n4.4.5 Sensitive data, for example, research data containing protectable intellectual property or ‘personal data’ about research participants, can be stored in Pure with the appropriate confidentiality restrictions, for example, by restricting visibility of the complete dataset, or applying an embargo to specific files. Restrictions should be minimised by any means possible, for instance by providing accessible information about how the data was collected, whether it can be accessed on a one-toone basis under a non-disclosure agreement (NDA), or whether a subset of the data can be made available). Guidance on handling and preparing sensitive data is available from the RDMS Service.\\n\\n#### 4.5 Research data and accompanying metadata and documentation must be registered in the University’s research information system, Pure.\\n\\n4.5.1  To support University monitoring and reporting on the research data produced by its Researchers, and to ensure the data are Findable, dataset records must be created and ultimately finalised in Pure following project completion or at the point of publication if this occurs during the project. As a general rule, data should be deposited in Pure within 3 months of project completion, unless necessary restrictions apply.\\n\\n4.5.2 In cases where a dataset is deposited with a trusted external data repository, for example, a subjectspecific repository or one operated by the lead institution on a project, Researchers must create a dataset record in Pure, with metadata and a persistent identifier, such as a Digital Object Identifier (DOI), directing to the source of the externally deposited dataset. There are numerous data repositories, some domain-specific, others which are advocated by a funder or publisher. Researchers should check if external data repositories specialising in their research area already exist and prioritise deposit in these repositories as they are designed for their disciplines and datasets. Assistance on locating such resources and evaluating their suitability against FAIR principles, University policy and any project-specific agreements can be accessed from the RDMS Service.\\n\\n4.5.3 As far as possible, data deposited externally should be openly accessible. If external data are deposited in a restricted format and the dataset is at risk of deletion, Researchers should offer this data for deposit in Pure for preservation purposes.\\n\\n4.5.4 In cases where the research is sensitive and/or confidential, a Researcher may request that the data (and descriptive metadata) are embargoed or restricted (for instance, to allow time to publish research findings, or comply with contractual obligations). Decisions to approve requests will be made by the RDMS Service in the first instance, although responsibility for ensuring deposited datasets with sensitive or confidential data are restricted in Pure lies with the Researcher.\\n\\n4.5.5  Each dataset in Pure should have an assigned contact responsible for dealing with any enquiries relating to the dataset. The contact person will normally be the Principal Investigator. If the Principal Investigator leaves the University, a new contact person should be identified before the departure date. If no new contact person is identified, it will default to the relevant Head of School /Department.\\n\\n4.5.6  Where a dataset record draft is started but not finalised, it can remain as an ‘entry in progress’ record for a maximum of 24 months, after which point the record will be deleted. Where a dataset record is required to remain at ‘entry in progress’ for longer than 24 months, an appropriate maximum retention period should be noted in the dataset description.\\n\\n4.5.7  Dataset records must by related to any other relevant content in Pure including publications, projects, activities and impacts.\\n\\n4.6 Research data that contribute to published research findings, or that have acknowledged long-term value, must be retained for a minimum of 10 years, or longer if stipulated by the funder or advised by discipline convention.\\n\\n4.6.1 Research data that contribute to published research findings must be deposited as in the requirement above and must be retained in order to demonstrate the integrity of the research and any published research findings. For guidance on how research data deposit activities align with the publication timeline, see the RDMS Integrated Workflow.\\n\\n4.6.2 Research data that underpins research findings must be preserved for a minimum period of 10 years, from date of last access/use. In some disciplines, such as clinical trial data, the advised retention period may be 20 years; for environmental data, this may be indefinite.\\n\\n4.6.3 Some funders require that data with acknowledged long-term value also be preserved and remain accessible and usable for future research4. Data with acknowledged long-term value should be preserved for a minimum period of 10 years, from date of last access/use, as above.\\n\\n4.6.4 A minimum retention period longer than 10 years may be specified by third parties for specific types of research output. Researchers can check the required retention period with the RDMS Service.\\n\\n#### 4.7 Documentation accompanying research data should be sufficient to understand, analyse, replicate, and re-use this data.\\n\\n4.7.1 Descriptive Metadata should be sufficient to ensure discovery, even in cases where public access to the data is restricted or has been removed.\\n\\n4.7.2 Documentation may be contained in many research outputs, including survey questionnaires, codebooks, standard operating procedures, informed consent forms, processing scripts, software code, workflows and other research outputs. Documentation should comply with the guidelines appropriate to the discipline in which the research is performed, and the type of research data produced.\\n\\n4.7.3 At a minimum, a Readme file describing the uploaded dataset files, file naming conventions, and folder structures must accompany finalised dataset deposits in Pure. It is the responsibility of Researchers to provide sufficient description in their metadata. Datasets with inadequate metadata may be returned to Researchers for further detail.\\n\\n4.7.4 In cases where a research project/study involves external collaboration, Researchers must consult the relevant collaboration agreement for details of agreed publication processes/protocol. In the absence of a formal collaboration agreement, decisions concerning the sharing of data and publication of results should be documented in the Data Management Plan prior to project commencement; any subsequent changes to the plan should be made with the consent off all parties concerned.\\n\\n#### 4.8 Published research outputs should include information on how to access deposited research data and other supporting material.\\n\\n4.8.1 Researchers must include a Data Access (Availability) Statement in their Accepted Author Manuscripts (AAM). Data Access Statements in publications - ‘even where there are no data associated with the article or the data are inaccessible’ - are a requirement of UKRI policy5, and many publishers also ask for them.6\\n\\n4.8.2 Within the Data Access Statement, the dataset should be cited using a persistent identifier such as a Digital Object Identifier (DOI), which will be provided during the dataset deposit process in Pure. Data Access Statements provide transparency and improve the Accessibility of the data - in keeping with FAIR principles. Moreover, their inclusion alerts readers to the existence and location of data, subsequently contributing to dataset usage/downloads, which will be a factor in assessing the overall impact of the research.\\n\\n4.8.3 Researchers should refer to the University Research Publications Guidance which advises on key aspects of preparing a research publication, including Data Access Statements. Further information is available on the Data Access Statements webpage.\\n\\n### 5. Rights relating to research data\\n\\nOwnership is a critical consideration in the management and sharing of research data. All right-holders should be identified at the earliest opportunity so that appropriate action can be taken to uphold their rights in accordance with relevant legislation and policies including the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR); UK Copyright law; and the University’s Intellectual Property (IP) & Commercialisation Policy. Besides Researchers, typical holders of rights to research data are collaborators, research participants, existing data owners and the University (as employer). The following examples illustrate some of the considerations that relate to these:\\n\\nCollaborators: Where research projects/studies involve collaboration with partners, industry, NHS etc., in most cases collaboration and contractual agreements will be drawn up to manage and document these partnerships. These legal agreements and contracts must be factored into project data management planning so that data are managed in line with agreed processes and licence agreements, and to ensure that data, which may, for example, not be suitable for public disclosure are not released inadvertently. The project Principal Investigator is responsible for appraising supervisees about any contractual agreements and the University’s Research and Knowledge Exchange Services (RKES) should be consulted in matters relating to legal, ethical, or commercial rights. If a formal collaboration agreement is not required, decisions regarding the storage and sharing of data should be documented in the Data Management Plan prior to project commencement, with any subsequent changes made with the consent off all parties concerned.\\n\\nResearch participants: Where research has involved the collection and/or processing of personal data, data protection legislation and ethical requirements must be complied with to ensure that the participants’ rights are respected. Where a research project/study has involved collecting data from people, for example, from focus groups or interviews, and there is a plan to publish large extracts of participants’ words, appropriate transfer of copyright must be in place.7\\n\\nExisting data owners: Where a project/study has used existing or secondary data sources, Researchers would not be expected to deposit existing/secondary data sources in Pure (unless there is a project agreement to state otherwise) - as they belong to the original data creators/owners. Instead, Researchers should include details of any published existing data sources used in the research by including the hyperlinks to the sources, initially in the DMP, and in the metadata - i.e., when describing the dataset. This way anyone wishing to scrutinise the research, would know where, and how, to access the existing/secondary data sources used, and then they too could arrange access for themselves. New data, derived from analyses of existing/secondary sources, can be deposited in Pure (if appropriate).\\n\\nThe University: In most cases, the IP generated by University Staff and Postgraduate Researchers in the course of their employment is the property of the University (making research data a Universityowned asset). For this reason, research data must be deposited into the institutional repository, Pure, at the end of the project or when a Researcher leaves employment and/or study with the University.8\\n\\n## Appendix A – Glossary of Terms\\n\\n<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"4\">Data Access (Availability) Statement</td><td>staff to make a preservation copy of the datasets deposited in the University of Strathclyde\\'s institutional data repository within Pure.</td></tr><tr><td>A statement, provided within a publication manuscript, which confirms the associatedwithsaidpublication.</td></tr><tr><td>Often a requirement of funder and publisher policy, these statements provide clarity and transparency, and aid data sharing and data discoverability.

We recognise the role of open research data in advancing scholarship, demonstrating academic integrity, and increasing transparency in research. Good practices in the management, dissemination, and preservation of research data are vital to a culture of open research. The University is committed to fulfilling compliance requirements around research data from third parties such as funders, publishers, government agencies, and external sponsors (see 3.5 legislative context).\\n\\n### 1.2 Scope\\n\\n1.2.1 This policy applies to all research data regardless of whether the research is funded or unfunded. It applies to all researchers but is unlikely to apply to undergraduate research except in exceptional circumstances (e.g. contributions towards publishable research).\\n\\n### 1.3 Definitions\\n\\nData Management Plan. A document addressing how research data will be captured, managed, stored, shared, and published, and how the integrity, security, and confidentiality of data will be maintained. It should be updated as necessary throughout active research projects.\\n\\nMetadata. Any documentation and descriptive information relevant to research data and research conclusions can be considered metadata. Some scholarly communities may have formal metadata standards for research data, which researchers should follow when appropriate. Metadata records in this policy refer to descriptive information about research data that is held by the Library to facilitate discoverability, sharing, and retention.\\n\\nOpen Access repository. An Open Access repository is an online database of research outputs, configured to support the storage, online discovery and machine-readability of its content. Institutional repositories, such as the University of Surrey Open Access repository, hold the research outputs of their institution. They can include publications, theses, research data and other research outputs; Open Access as well as restricted items; and full texts as well as bibliographic records. Subject or disciplinary repositories, such as PubMedCentral, can host outputs from several institutions.\\n\\nResearch data. The University of Surrey considers research data to be any material collected, observed, processed, or created for the purpose of analysis and on which research findings and outputs are based. This includes data and documentation which is commonly accepted in the scholarly community as necessary for validation or replication of research findings. Research data may be in digital or non-digital formats.\\n\\nResearchers. The University of Surrey defines researchers as members of the University, including staff, doctoral and postgraduate students, visiting researchers, and those who conduct research on University premises, use University facilities for research, or work on University research projects.\\n\\n## 2 Policy Principles\\n\\n2.1 Research data will be managed throughout the research data lifecycle in accordance with other University policies and legal, funder, regulatory, and ethical requirements. Researchers are expected to manage and respect any confidentiality, privacy, national security, indigenous rights, and intellectual property aspects of their research data.\\n\\nPrincipal investigators are responsible for ensuring all members of the research team abide by the University’s research data management requirements, including making sure all members of the research team are aware of and abide by any applicable data management plans created.\\n\\n2.2 Any research activity where research data may be created or re-used should include at the outset a data management plan. These plans are to be updated and maintained during the life of the research project.\\n\\nResearchers, in particular principal investigators, are responsible for creating and updating a research data management plan for research projects in accordance with funder and university expectations.\\n\\n2.3 For data underpinning published research findings, reasonable efforts should be made to make them available for access and re-use with as few restrictions as possible, where legally, ethically and commercially appropriate. This should be done in a timely manner, no later than 12 months after publication or as soon as required by publishers and funders.\\n\\n2.4 Where it can be made accessible, research data should be deposited in a data service, disciplinary data repository, or the University’s Open Access repository as appropriate.\\n\\nResearchers are responsible for identifying, preparing, and transferring data for sharing and/or preservation to appropriate repositories, including the University’s repository. In special cases, Library and IT Services may facilitate transfer and dissemination (e.g. very large datasets or sensitive data).\\n\\n2.5 Unless explicitly stated in a collaborative contract where Intellectual Property Right (IPR) or data responsibility is retained by another institution, all research data must be registered with the University by creating a metadata record in the University’s repository, even if the data is hosted elsewhere (e.g., in a third-party repository).\\n\\nResearchers are responsible for registering their research data by creating a metadata record in the University’s repository or by sending a link to an existing repository record to the Library’s Open Research team. Metadata and data records created in the University repository are considered registered. The Library will be responsible for holding and making publicly available these metadata records.\\n\\n2.6 Research data that substantiate research findings or is of long-term value should be preserved in an appropriate format with adequate documentation for verification and reuse for a minimum of 10 years from project end or as long as is mandated by funder, ethical, legal, or regulatory requirements.\\n\\n2.7 A data access or availability statement should be included in published papers. It should describe where and on what terms supporting research data may be accessed.\\n\\n## 3 Governance Requirements\\n\\n### 3.1 Implementation / Communication Plan\\n\\n3.1.1  The policy will be publicly available on the University of Surrey’s policy website. It will also be promoted via news posts, presentations, and direct communication with relevant staff.\\n\\n3.1.2  Implementation of the policy will be supported by policy specific guidance on the Library’s Open Research website, including links to other relevant guidance, e.g.  Research Integrity and Governance Office, Data Protection, IT Services, funders policies, etc.\\n\\n3.1.3 The Open Research team, based in the Library, will provide advice, guidance, support, and training on all elements of research data management and open data before, during, and after research is undertaken.\\n\\n3.1.4 Heads of Departments/Schools and others responsible for research staff and students are responsible for ensuring that researchers in their areas are aware of the University’s policy and supporting guidelines and procedures regarding research data management.\\n\\n3.1.5 IT Services are responsible for providing technical infrastructure for the storage and backup of research data during active research as appropriate.\\n\\n### 3.2 Exceptions to this Policy\\n\\n3.2.1 Research data subject to funder, regulatory, and contractual requirements should be managed according to those requirements and any exceptions should be approved by the sponsor, funder, or relevant authority. This policy applies in the absence of any superseding requirements or contracts. External researchers may be exempted from this policy with approval from the relevant principal investigator.\\n\\n### 3.4 Review and Update\\n\\n3.4.1 This policy should be reviewed every 2 years, unless changes in regulations, other policies or improvements to its implementation require an interim update. Minor interim changes such as change of a role title or other titles or names or typos, which do not change the meaning of the policy will be handled by the operational owner. Major changes, i.e. anything that alters the meaning of the policy or are substantial, will be submitted via the full approval route.\\n\\n### 3.5 Legislative context\\n\\nMany funders and charities have policies that apply to universities and researchers. UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) expects researchers to comply with a set of principles surrounding research data management and open data. This includes the Concordant on Open Research Data (  UKRI also has a Common Principles on Research Data ( \\n\\nIndividual research councils have published clear expectations of organisations in receipt of research funding regarding research data management. These individual policies are meant to be understood in conjunction with the Concordant on Open Research Data and UKRI’s Common Principles on Data Policy.

       " '# UWE Research Data Management Policy\\n\\n## 1 Introduction and Purpose\\n\\n### Context\\n\\nThe University’s Research Strategy aims to achieve globally recognised research with real world impact. The Research Data Management Policy supports this aim by seeking to increase the quality, integrity and accessibility of UWE Bristol’s research data which can lead to greater research impact and enhanced reputation.\\n\\nThe policy reflects the UWE Bristol Open Research Statement which encourages our researchers to be as open as possible, as early as possible, and to explore options for open research including open access publication of research findings and open sharing of data, taking account of university and other policies.\\n\\nResearch data management is the effective handling of data that is accessed, used or created in the course of research. Effective research data management is carried out for the entire lifecycle of the research data, from the point of creation through to dissemination, publication and archiving. Aspects of research data management will usually continue long after the initial research project has ended.\\n\\nManaging and sharing research data can increase its visibility (and consequently the visibility of research), ensuring the full potential of research is exploited. This can then provide a growing resource for further research, education and training.\\n\\n### Purpose\\n\\nThe University considers the safe and effective management of research data to be integral to good research practice. This purpose of this policy is therefore:\\n\\n1. To promote the highest standards of research integrity by ensuring that research data accessed, used or produced by UWE Bristol staff and post graduate research (PGR) students, or under UWE’s auspices, is managed (created, stored, used, reused, archived or destroyed) according to good research practice and ethical requirements, legal and regulatory frameworks and funder requirements.\\n2. To establish sound research data management practices which protect the interests of research participants and researchers, and which support the proper conduct of research and validation of research findings.\\n3. To promote appropriate preservation, sharing and re-use of research data.\\n4. To provide broad and inclusive guidance which enable all employees and PGRs to manage their research data effectively.\\n5. To outline the responsibilities and requirements of the University and its researchers.\\n\\nResearch Data Security Guidance Data Protection Standard for Research\\n\\n## 2 Scope and Definitions\\n\\nThe policy applies to all UWE Bristol employees and PGR students who produce or use research data as part of their research (hereafter “researchers’) regardless of the research funding source.\\n\\nThe policy applies to all research data, or materials, (digital or physical) created, cocreated or used by all UWE Bristol staff or PGR students.\\n\\nResearch Data is all data or materials (digital or physical) arising as a result of a research project.\\n\\nResearch data can be raw data, analysed data, and data which arise during the course of research, including data later translated into another form or destroyed, such as audio and video recordings. Examples of research data include, but are not limited to, statistics, collections of digital images, sound and video recordings, transcripts of interviews, survey data and fieldwork observations with appropriate annotations, an interpretation, an artwork, archives, found objects, published texts or a manuscript, lab books, and data generated by machines and instruments.\\n\\n## 3 General Principles\\n\\nResearch data is a valuable asset which is expensive to produce and sometimes cannot be reproduced. UWE Bristol therefore expects researchers to effectively manage research data.\\nResearchers must make themselves aware of, and comply with relevant legislation and regulation, ethical requirements, contractual obligations and funder requirements, professional standards and University policies, as they apply to their research data, during the full research lifecycle.\\nResearchers should apply appropriate measures to ensure research participants are protected during the full research data lifecycle, and must comply with both GDPR and the supplementary Data Protection Act 2018.\\nUWE Bristol supports the principles of open research. Research data should be preserved and made available for sharing and re-use as quickly as possible, with as few restrictions as possible, when it is appropriate and safe to do so.  FAIR principles\\n\\n(findable, accessible, interoperable, re-usable) should be considered as part of this process.\\n\\n## 4 Policy/ Procedure/ Code of Practice\\n\\n### 4.1 Researcher responsibilities\\n\\nAll researchers are required to familiarise themselves with this policy and the University’s research data management guidance.\\n\\nResearchers must comply with the following requirements, including making themselves aware of, and adhering to, relevant legislation and regulation, funders’ requirements and relevant University policies.\\n\\nThe UWE Bristol Research Project Manager is responsible for ensuring that there is sound research data management practice in relation to the project. This includes the management of all research data collected, generated or used during a project. A research data management plan must be in place at the start of the research, before any work with research data takes place.\\n\\nResearchers are responsible for seeking, where possible, the direct costs of research data management, including the preparation of data for archiving, from their research funder. The resources necessary for the appropriate management of data throughout its life course should be set out in the Research Data Management Plan.\\n\\nCollaborative research involving partners outside the University should normally be the subject of a collaboration agreement, and the arrangements for management of research data must be clearly set out in the agreement.\\n\\nAll research data is subject to the University’s Intellectual Property Policy, and intellectual property issues related to research data must be considered at the outset. Exclusive rights to research data must not be granted to a third party where this will restrict the ability to make the data openly available for re-use unless this is a condition of funding or of a collaboration agreement. The intellectual property rights of others in third party data being used for research must be respected. Commitments about IP, either explicit or implicit, must not be made in communications with companies or other external organisations (see the UWE guide on Intellectual Property and Research).\\n\\nResearchers are responsible for complying with UWE’s data security requirements as outlined in UWE guidance, including the Information Security Toolkit, Research Data Security Guidance and Data Protection Guidance.\\n\\no Research data should be actively managed throughout the research lifecycle to protect its integrity and security. Where research data is stored, it must be stored and backed up according to law and regulation, and UWE guidelines.\\no Confidential data must only be stored on UWE approved systems. Other cloud hosted systems are not permitted for this purpose.\\no Researchers must use UWE managed devices, and UWE approved software solutions, to create, store or process restricted or confidential information.\\no Access to data should be controlled, and there should always be more than one appropriate person with access to the data.\\no Where data is collected, transported or stored off site, this must be strictly in accordance with UWE research data security guidance.\\no Where personal data (as defined by the Data Protection Act) is likely to cross international boundaries, the UWE Data Protection Office must be consulted.\\n\\nIf the UWE Research Project Manager leaves the university, it is the responsibility of the Dean of School to ensure that an appropriate hand over of data takes place, and a new UWE Research Project Manager with responsibility for the data is immediately in place. In the absence of such an arrangement, the Dean of School will be deemed the Research Project Manager in relation to the data. Research Data may not be removed from UWE by a leaving staff member without the express permission in writing from the Dean of Faculty or the Pro Vice Chancellor Research and Enterprise, as appropriate.\\n\\n#### Retention of research data\\n\\nResearch data must be assessed for retention, according to the UWE Data Retention\\nSchedule. Research data not selected for retention must be appropriately and securely\\ndestroyed in a timely way, and a record of its destruction made. o Destruction may need to take place because the research data is not deemed sufficiently valuable to warrant the costs of storing and supporting it. o Research data may also need to be destroyed where consents, or legal or regulatory requirements, mean that this is necessary.\\n\\n#### Sharing and re-using research data\\n\\nThe UWE Research Project Manager / PI is responsible for ensuring that all legal, ethical and contractual requirements are complied with in relation to third party access to data.\\n\\nWhere safeguards can be set in place which will allow access, including where this is in line with participant consent and ethical approval, where this is in line with any legal or contractual obligations such as those relating to intellectual property and where data may be of use to others, it is the expectation that data will be made available for sharing and re-use.\\n\\no Such research data will normally be preserved and made openly available within 12 months of completion of the project, with as few restrictions as possible on use by depositing it in an appropriate national or international archive, and/or the UWE data repository.\\no In relation to personal data, the retention period is governed by Data Protection legislation and this must be complied with, as well as complying with the terms of the original Participant Consent. Such research data can only be preserved if it is fully anonymised and cannot be linked back to research participants. Metadata to aid discovery of all research data, including any research data held in collaborating institutions, must be provided to the UWE Research Data repository within 12 months of the end of the project, whether or not it is deemed appropriate to be made publicly available.\\nWhere data is to be accessed by third parties via the UWE Research Data Repository, data documentation should be sufficient for the data to be understandable and reuseable.\\n\\nWhere research data cannot be accessed by others for good reasons, the data may still need to be retained for potential verification of the integrity of the research or future use by the research team, or in compliance with regulation. This should be covered in the Research Data Management Plan. However, in relation to personal data, the retention period is governed by Data Protection legislation and this must be complied with, as well as complying with the terms of ethical approval and the original participant consent. Retention must always be considered on a case by case basis.\\n\\nUnless constrained otherwise, e.g. for reasons of sensitivity or commercial interest, researchers must include a data access statement in any publication based upon it. This should cite the research data and how to access it, where appropriate. Where it is inappropriate for the data to be made openly available, a reference must be made to the location of the metadata.\\n\\n### 4.2 Postgraduate Research Student and Supervisor Responsibilities\\n\\nPGR students are expected to comply with the general requirements for storing, managing and sharing data as outlined above.\\n\\nPGR students are advised to check the ownership of their data with the UWE IP team particularly where they are in receipt of funding.\\n\\nThe Director of Studies, as UWE Research Project Manager, is responsible for ensuring that a research data management plan is in place for each PGR project under their management. This must be completed by the PGR, in consultation and partnership with, and approved by, the Director of Studies, and in consultation with the supervisory team and other UWE colleagues as necessary, by the time of the first progression exam. The plan should be reviewed at subsequent milestones.\\n\\nResearch data relating to doctoral theses should be added to the UWE research data repository as part of the completion process, when it is appropriate and safe to do so. Such research data will be subject to an automatic 24 month embargo.\\n\\nFull requirements relating to the creation of research data management plans, and the deposit of research data to the UWE Research Data Repository, can be found in the Graduate School Handbook.\\n\\n### 4.3 University responsibilities\\n\\nThe University will provide the infrastructure, advice and training to support research data management, including mechanisms for the registration, storage, deposit and retention of research data throughout its life cycle.\\n\\nThe University will preserve and provide access to research data, beyond the duration of a research activity and in accordance with specific retention requirements.\\n\\nThe University will provide a research data repository to allow researchers to preserve their data, openly publish their data and enable access to their data when it is appropriate to do so.\\n\\nThe University will provide methods and procedures for controlled access to restricted data for approved researchers.\\n\\nPrinciples of findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR) data are promoted to all relevant research and support staff and other stakeholders\\n\\n## 5 Further guidance and support\\n\\nThe policy will be implemented in conjunction with advocacy, training and support from Research Governance and Library Services.\\n\\nSupport for research data management is available from:\\n\\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Manageyourresearchdata</td></tr><tr><td>UWE Research Data Repository - repository@uwe.ac.uk</td></tr><tr><td>ResearchDataSecurity</td></tr><tr><td>Library Research Support Team - lib.rke@uwe.ac.uk</td></tr><tr><td>Research Governance - reserachgovernance@uwe.ac.uk</td></tr><tr><td>DataProtectionOffice-dataprotection@uwe.ac.uk</td></tr><tr><td>UWE Learning & Development - My Learning Staff Development Hub (UWE intranet)</td></tr></table></body></html>\\n\\n## 6 Ownership and Oversight\\n\\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Document name:</td><td>Research Data Management Policy</td></tr><tr><td>Version number:</td><td>V2.0</td></tr><tr><td>Equality Analysis:</td><td>Draft submitted for comment March 2022, currently</td></tr><tr><td>First approved by:</td><td>reviewing initial feedback Academic Board 12/10/2022</td></tr><tr><td>This version approved by:</td><td>University Research and Knowledge Exchange Committee 15/06/2022</td></tr><tr><td>Effective from:</td><td>05/12/2022</td></tr><tr><td>Next review date:</td><td>2025</td></tr><tr><td>Senior Policy Owner:</td><td>Director of LCl and Director of RBI</td></tr><tr><td>Policy Author:</td><td>Research Governance Manager, RBI</td></tr><tr><td>Overseeing committee:</td><td>Head of Research Support, Library Services Research and Knowledge Exchange Committee</td></tr><tr><td>Compliance measures:</td><td>Instances where it is not possible to manage research data in line with the RDM policy will be noted, reviewed</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"4\">Related policies, procedures and codes of practice:</td><td>and escalated as appropriate.

       " \"# Research Data Management Procedure v1 – April 2023\\n\\n## RESEARCH DATA MANAGEMENT PROCEDURE\\n\\n### Introduction\\n\\nThis document aims to enable and support best practice in research data management at UWS, reflecting the University’s commitment to the UK Concordat on Open Research Data. The University recognises the importance of meeting funders’ requirement with regard to open research data and wishes to contribute to a research environment where data is shared as widely as possible, so that other researchers may both consult data to validate the published findings and re-use the data for new research purposes.\\n\\n\\nFigure 1: Jisc (2018), “Research data lifecycle” in Research data management toolkit. Available at:  \\n\\n### Scope\\n\\nThis document applies to all research data generated or adapted by Researchers at UWS, including postgraduate (PG) research students and visiting researchers. The University requires its Researchers to manage research data responsibly, and to preserve and disseminate data of long-term value in line with this Procedure.\\n\\n### Definitions\\n\\nArchive data: data that is selected for retention upon completion of the project, that has been curated into a usable and accessible format.\\n\\nData Management Plans (DMPs) are living documents that describe how data will be managed during the life of the project. As living documents, they can and should be updated throughout the course of the project. DMPs are often requested by funders at the bid stage and should state what data will be created and how, outline plans for sharing and preservation and note any restrictions on access.\\n\\nData repository: storage space for Researchers to deposit datasets associated with their research.\\n\\nDOI: Digital Object Identifier.\\n\\nDynamic data: data that is collected during an active research project. This is likely to change throughout the project.\\n\\nMetadata: literally “data about other data”. In the context of this document, it refers to descriptive or contextual information that helps the identification, location, retrieval of and access to data and research outputs.\\n\\nPrincipal Investigator (PI): the individual leading a programme of research.\\n\\nResearch Data: includes a range of sources that have been used to carry out the research. They may include, for example, statistics, collections of digital images, sound/video recordings, sketchbooks, transcripts of interviews, survey data etc. The primary purpose of research data is to provide the information necessary to support or validate a research project's observations, findings or outputs. Please refer to the Concordat on Open Research Data   - for a comprehensive definition.\\n\\nResearch Data Management (RDM): encompasses the sum of activities undertaken by researchers and research organisations in relation to the collection, processing, retention and disposal of research data.\\n\\nResearcher: anyone undertaking research or involved in collecting, generating or creating research data for or on behalf of the University, which shall include, but not be limited to, employees, postgraduate (PG) research students and visiting researchers.\\n\\nUniversity Repository: storage space where researchers upload details of their research outputs and activities. At UWS, PURE is used as the institutional research repository.\\n\\n### Benefits of Research Data Management and Open Data\\n\\nFollowing good research data management procedures provides several benefits to researchers:\\n\\nEnhancing the visibility and impact of the individual’s and the University’s research Quicker results, as data is shared and reused\\nFacilitating interdisciplinary research\\nIncreasing transparency and ensuring validation of results\\nEnsuring compliance with funders’ requirements.\\n\\n### Data management responsibilities\\n\\nResearchers have a responsibility to take care of the data they collect while working and studying at the University, and to manage them in accordance with any relevant\\u202ffunders' policies. In particular, Researchers are required, wherever possible, to\\u202fpreserve and share data\\u202fthat supports published research findings by depositing them in a suitable data repository. The Principal Investigator (or the lead Researcher at UWS, in case of collaborative projects where the PI is based elsewhere) or research student, is responsible for the research data management and compliance to funders’ or regulatory agencies’ legislative or contractual obligations throughout the course of the project.\\n\\nResearchers are responsible for ensuring that, when leaving the institution, a copy of the data produced under the auspices of the University is retained and appropriate appraisal decisions in relation to the retention, transference of ownership, or destruction of research data held in the University’s storage environments are made.\\n\\nThe line manager or Lead Supervisor is responsible to ensure that a new data owner is appointed, who can make curatorial decisions about the data (such as those relating to the deletion or migration of data). Ultimate responsibility lies with the Head of School.\\n\\nThe University’s role is to provide training, support and, where possible, mechanisms for deposit and funder-compliant storage of data.\\n\\n### Planning Data Collection and Data Management Plans\\n\\nEvery new research proposal should address any requirements related to the collection and use of data. This can be achieved by creating a data management plan (DMP). Where specifically required by funding bodies, the DMP should adhere to the funders’ requirements. Research data management roles and responsibilities should be clearly defined and documented within a research project. Where there are no specific funders’ requirements, the UWS data management template should be used. The template can be downloaded at  \\n\\ned8RBrTdpzX_S-eMBkx5hd2P8XpbowvOUVpJHPA?e=uArCw5&CID=57F3DEEE5BA7-4875-8F30-35F1EB96AA54. More information on the requirements of funders and preparation of data management plans is provided by the Digital Curation Centre -  \\n\\nThe PI or PG research student is responsible for ensuring that a DMP is completed for every project, kept up-to-date throughout the project, and complied with by all members of the project.\\n\\n### Data sharing\\n\\nThe University’s position is that data should be as open as it can be, to encourage reuse, and should be managed in accordance to the Principles set out in the\\u202fUKRI Common Principles on Data Policy -   -, that 'publicly funded research data are a public good, produced in the public interest, which should be made openly available with as few restrictions as possible in a timely and responsible manner'.\\n\\nThere might be circumstances where restrictions need to be applied (e.g., third party content, sensitive data, confidentiality). Any access restrictions should be clearly stated and explained in the DMP.\\n\\nData must be accessible and well signposted. It is an expectation that the records containing metadata of research outputs on the University Repository will include links to the relevant datasets, wherever stored.\\n\\nWhen a dataset has been deposited in a data repository or otherwise stored for preservation, the Researcher should register the details of the dataset with the University by contacting pure@uws.ac.uk, with the persistent identifier or DOI,  even if access to the data is restricted, so that a record of the data can be maintained and made available for discovery.\\n\\n### Data storage\\n\\nDuring the life of the project, Researchers must ensure that dynamic data is stored securely, is organised effectively and is protected from loss. Researchers should use University-approved storage and follow the University’s procedures, in order to guarantee the security and integrity of research data and protect against loss or corruption.\\n\\nTechnical support requirements for the collection, storage and processing of research data should be considered at the planning stage. Information about data storage and other support for the management of research data provided by IT can be found at  \\n\\nOn completion of the project, data selected for archiving should be stored in a suitable data repository, that meets the stated criteria. The data repository chosen for depositing the archive data should allow deposit into additional repositories. Any external data repository selected must not charge any fee for access to the stored data. Where use of a specific data repository is mandated by the funder, Researchers must comply.\\n\\nA metadata record for all archive research data hosted internally and externally must be added to the University Repository. Researchers are advised to review the FAIR Principles -   - for guidance on the construction of appropriate metadata.\\n\\nResearch data selected for archiving should normally be preserved and accessible for a period of 10 years, but a longer period should be considered for projects of major clinical, social or environmental importance. Where a storage period is mandated by the funder, this should be adhered to as an absolute minimum.\\n\\n### Data rights\\n\\nUnless mandated by the funder, exclusive rights to reuse and publish data must not be passed to commercial entities without retaining the rights to make the data openly available for reuse.\\n\\nDatasets should be assigned appropriate licences to state ownership and clarify data reuse. Creative Commons licences are strongly recommended.\\n\\nThe University reserves the right to keep a copy of the research data related to all research conducted under its auspices, even when Researchers responsible for the data leave the institution.\\n\\nFor research projects involving the collection and handling of personal data, a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) should be conducted.

Appendix 1: FAIR principles . 9 Appendix 2: Regulations, guidelines, codes, and policies relevant for RDM . .10 Appendix 3: Roles and responsibilities . .11 Appendix 4: Glossary .. .14\\n\\n## 1 INTRODUCTION\\n\\nGood scientific practice is one of the main reasons to manage research data1 during and archive the data after the project. It is important to keep available the raw, processed and/or analyzed data, as well as the documentation necessary for understanding the data and the way it was collected, processed and analyzed. This plays an important role in accountability issues, and allows the researcher to reuse his/her own data or to return to earlier stages of the research process when needed. As a result, research will be reproducible and verifiable. Proper research data management (RDM) makes science more transparent, and improves scientific integrity and societal trust.\\n\\n### Open Science, FAIR data\\n\\nMore recently, Open Science and the wish to make optimal use of publicly-funded scientific publications and data developed into a second main reason for RDM. The results of research - publications and data- should be available for other scientists and for society. This favors both citizens and entrepreneurs, while researchers benefit in terms of funding and acknowledgement of impact in research evaluations.\\n\\nAs a general policy, research data underlying publications should be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Re-usable (FAIR, see appendix 1). This does not mean, however, that all data should be ‘open’. The basic principle is that data should be open to the public whenever possible and closed when needed. Closure, temporary closure (embargo) or limited/restricted access can be justified by, for instance, arrangements with research funders, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR, in Dutch: Algemene verordening gegevensbescherming, AVG), public safety, and/or intellectual property rights of third parties.\\n\\nThese insights are gradually translated and formalized in international, national and local policies and frameworks formulated by science institutions, research funding agencies, and policy makers (see appendix 2). In the Dutch National coalition agreement 2017, ‘Open science’ and ‘Open access’ are presented as normative.\\n\\n### New UT data policy\\n\\nIn 2015 the UT accepted the first version of a research data policy. Since that time the issue of the responsibility of universities for managing the research data they generate, obtain and (fully or partially) own has become more important. This is due to the growing attention to the proper handling of research data in scientific practice, the increasing amount of (digital) data, and the growing demand of integrity and open science. Therefore, the UT-data policy of 2015 is updated, resulting in this RDM policy, which pays more attention to the benefits of RDM for the researcher and gives more specifically defined instructions on good research data management at the UT.\\n\\nThe aim of this RDM policy is to stimulate the awareness of the need and benefits of good research data management (section 2) and offer clear rules for managing research data at the UT (section 3). Both sections are relevant for the main target group: the UT scientific community, e.g. researchers and research managers, who have the main responsibility of data management in research projects.\\n\\nBesides, also general managers in the faculties and those who are involved in research data management support can benefit from this document, especially section 3.\\n\\nThis Research Data Management policy as well as practical information and general information about RDM, can be found at www.utwente.nl/researchsupport.\\n\\n## 2 WHAT BENEFITS CAN RDM BRING RESEARCHERS?\\n\\nRDM can bring researchers several benefits, which can be categorized as follows:\\n\\n1. Reputation and impact\\n\\nGood RDM allows for the publishing of datasets and consequently its citation. This improves the visibility of your research and therefore its citation rate, reputation, and its scientific impact.\\nWhen citizen science is used for data collection, and open data are used by societal parties, societal impact is improved.\\nMore scientific and societal impact will lead to better results in research assessments and staff evaluations.\\n\\n### 2. Quality, efficiency, safety and integrity\\n\\nGood RDM improves the quality of research. Your data are always accurate, complete, authentic and reliable. Making the data early and easy available to colleagues and reviewers, provides you with an extra quality check.\\nOn the basis of your data, others can quite simply verify your results. Open data reduces the risk of manipulation.\\nRDM reduces the risk of data loss by keeping your research data safe and secure.\\nAfter an initial investment in time, planning for your data management needs and\\ndocumenting your data throughout its life cycle can save you time and resources in the long run.\\nEnabling other researchers to use your data or being able to use other researchers data prevents duplication of effort.\\n\\n3. Reuse, new results and new collaborations\\n\\nYou can benefit from findable and reusable high quality data collected by other researchers. Reuse and re-analysis of data make possible the testing of new or alternative hypotheses and methods of analysis; enables the exploration of topics not envisioned by the initial investigators; encourages diversity of analysis and opinion. Combining datasets from multiple sources through meta-analysis promotes new types of research and permits the creation of new data sets, information, and knowledge. Open data practices facilitate collaboration within and outside your discipline. This allows the crossing of boundaries of disciplines and institutions, and leads to co-publications.\\n\\n## 3 RDM POLICY AT THE UT\\n\\nAs a general starting point the UT RDM policy implies that faculties and/or research groups\\n\\nsupport the implementation of the FAIR-principles: Research data must be Findable,\\nAccessible, Interoperable, and Re-usable (see appendix 1)\\ncommit to the general principle that research data is classified as public data unless there are\\nspecific requirements to maintain the confidentiality of research data, such as when a\\nresearcher is bound to protect the confidential information of a collaborating company or\\nwhen the data relates to human subjects\\nstimulate awareness regarding RDM practices and develop a culture in which researchers are\\nstimulated to and rewarded for sharing data\\ninclude the provision of RDM-training and -support to researchers\\nfacilitate solid infrastructure and tools for storing and archiving research data both during\\nand after the research\\nmonitor the development and execution of Data Management Plans (DMP)\\n\\n### Privacy regulations\\n\\nWhen applicable, special attention must be given to handling with personal data. Specific RDM policies within a faculty must comply with the GDPR (in Dutch: AVG). For more information about privacy related issues, see:\\n\\n1. UT privacy policy: www.utwente.nl/en/cyber-safety/cybersafety/legislation 2. UT privacy statement: www.utwente.nl/en/about-our-website 3. Privacy guidelines for research: www.utwente.nl/en/cybersafety/cybersafety/privacy/guideline-for-research/\\n\\n### Data management plan\\n\\nGood RDM starts with the writing of a data management plan . Most research funders require a DMP as part of funding application or to be handed in shortly after the start of the project. Specific RDM regulations in the faculty must describe the procedure about when and where a DMP has to be handed in and how reviewing and monitoring is organized.\\n\\nEvery research project must have a DMP. The DMP can be derived from the specific RDM regulations and procedures at the nearest organizational level in the faculty.\\nEvery PhD-student follows the TGS-course Research Data Management as a preparation of the writing of a DMP.\\nThe DMP has to be reviewed and monitored regularly, in line with planning and progress of the research project.\\n\\n### Data storage\\n\\nTo prevent data loss during a research project research data and related materials must be stored properly.\\n\\nAll collected research data, including related materials (e.g. protocols, models or questionnaires), must be stored in the ISO 27001- and NEN 7510-certified facilities. Certified data storage\\n\\nfacilities are offered by the UT-ICT services (LISA). If applicable, terms of use of data suppliers are leading.\\n\\nPersonal cloud services must only be used for copies and comply with legal and contractual conditions. The preferred personal cloud service is Surfdrive. This service complies to the Dutch and European privacy legislation.\\nStorage of research data on portable devices must be avoided as much as possible, if needed should only be used for copies and must comply with legal and contractual conditions. Personal, confidential or classified research data and related materials, such as consent forms, must be stored in accordance with relevant Dutch legislation and European regulation and the VSNU Conduct code for the use of personal data in scientific research (UNL Code of conduct for using personal data in research [in Dutch]) for which UT-storage mentioned above is available. Non-digital research data and related materials, such as physical samples and lab notebooks, must be handled in accordance with clearly described procedures within the organisational unit and/or project.\\n\\n### Data documentation\\n\\nIn line with the FAIR principles data must be well documented, during the dynamic phase of the data and especially as soon as they have become static.\\n\\nResearch data and related materials, both digital and non-digital, must be accompanied by proper metadata and documentation in such a way that it enables the verification, replication and, if possible, reuse of the data. This documentation must also contain information about property rights and terms of use.\\n\\n### Data sharing\\n\\nTo guarantee that data can be accessed and checked during the research digital and/or non-digital research data and related materials must be shared. Implementation is dependent of intellectual property and responsibilities regarding research data, and the terms of use of data suppliers.\\n\\nDuring the research project data and related materials must be shared in such a way that, apart from the researcher, it can be accessed by at least one other member of the organisational unit. Before the end of the project all research data and related materials which is needed for verification/replication and reuse, must be made available to the responsible in the\\norganisational unit (see also RDM roles and responsibilities).\\nPersonal, confidential or classified research data and related materials, such as consent forms, must be shared in accordance with relevant Dutch legislation and European regulation and the VSNU Conduct code for the use of personal data in scientific research (UNL Code of conduct for using personal data in research [in Dutch]). The ISO 27001- and NEN 7510-certified projectand organization directory of the UT is recommended for secure sharing of personal data. In case of a Non-Disclosure Agreement with third parties, arrangements must be made about sharing data during the research.\\n\\n### Data archiving\\n\\nFor the purpose of verification, replication and reuse research data and related materials must be archived after the research project. Implementation is dependent of intellectual property and responsibilities regarding research data, and the terms of use of data suppliers\\n\\nSelection of research data and related materials for long-term preservation is based on what is needed for verification/replication and reuse. This must be at least the research data that form the basis of and can therefore be linked to publications. The selection to be archived can also comprise the full set of raw and/or processed data. In case of large data sets archiving costs, for both preparation and storage, should be taken into account when applying for project funding. Preferably during, but not later than 1 month after finishing the research selected data and related materials are archived in both group or faculty facilities and in a trusted repository, in accordance with FAIR-principles (see appendix 1) and, in compliance with legal and contractual conditions, openly accessible. The preferred archive for data from the technical and beta sciences is 4TU.ResearchData, and DANS for data from the social sciences.\\nSelected research data and related materials must be archived at least for 10 years, unless legal or contractual regulations demand another term.\\nNon-digital research data and related materials, such as physical samples or lab notebooks, must be archived in secure UT-provisions accompanied with clearly described access procedures. In case of a Non-Disclosure Agreement with third parties, arrangements must be made about archiving and sharing of data for verification and replication.\\nArchived research data and related materials, both digital and non-digital, are accompanied with proper metadata for findability and good documentation for reasons of interpretation and reusability (see also data documentation and data registration).\\n\\n### Data registration\\n\\nBecause research data is becoming a valuable asset and in the near future will be formally recognized as scientific output, it is important to know what digital and/or non-digital research data and related materials have been created or used and where these are located.\\n\\nIn addition to archiving, all digital and/or non-digital research data and related materials must be registered and described by metadata, including a link or reference to the location of the digital or non-digital objects.\\nThe preferred system for registration of digital and/or non-digital research data and related materials is Pure Research Information because of automatic ingest of metadata from other systems (such as 4TU.ResearchData). Moreover these data and related materials can be linked to the registered UT publications based on them.\\n\\n## 4 RDM POLICY IMPLEMENTATION\\n\\nAlthough dealing with research data may vary a lot per research discipline, the Executive Board has formulated this RDM policy as a framework of proper and responsible handling of research data. Faculties must implement this policy at one or more organizational levels (faculty, department, group and/or other unit) and supplement it with regulations and procedures related to the specific character or circumstances of the research discipline in question.\\n\\nRDM regulations and procedures in the faculty must be available on the relevant websites or intranet and communicated in such a way that every researcher can easily find these.\\n\\n### RDM roles and responsibilities\\n\\nWhen implementing the UT RDM policy in the faculty it is important to identify and formalize RDM roles and responsibilities. This can comprise responsibilities like having and maintaining a RDM policy on one or more organizational levels in the faculty as well as monitoring the compliance to this policy. Also, operational RDM responsibilities must be addressed, like stimulating RDM awareness, the writing and monitoring of Data Management Plans (DMP), and the implementation and maintenance of necessary RDM facilities. An overview of RDM roles and responsibilities can be found in appendix 3.\\n\\nIn case of third party involvement, roles and responsibilities regarding research data management must be included in agreements. Good research data management is the shared responsibility of all parties involved. In principle, intellectual property rights on research data (“database right”) shall vest in UT.\\n\\nIn line with the university’s responsibility regarding RDM, support, infrastructure and facilities are offered by service department LISA. Specific RDM support, infrastructure and facilities can also be offered by faculties or other organizational units, in some cases in cooperation with LISA.\\n\\n## APPENDIX 1: FAIR PRINCIPLES\\n\\n### Preamble\\n\\nOne of the grand challenges of data-intensive science is to facilitate knowledge discovery by assisting humans and machines in their discovery of, access to, integration and analysis of, task-appropriate scientific data and their associated algorithms and workflows.

(meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation.\\nI2. (meta)data use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles.\\nI3. (meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data.\\n\\n#### To be Re-usable:\\n\\nR1. meta(data) have a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes.\\nR1.1. (meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license.\\nR1.2. (meta)data are associated with their provenance.\\nR1.3. (meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards.\\n\\nSource and further information:  \\n\\n## APPENDIX 2: REGULATIONS, GUIDELINES, CODES, AND POLICIES RELEVANT FOR RDM\\n\\nThis is a list of regulations, guidelines, codes, and policies which are useful or necessary to read when writing a data policy or data management plan.

Introduction\\n\\nThe University of Westminster recognises that the good management of research data throughout the research lifecycle improves the transparency, integrity, reproducibility, and reach of scholarly research. Good research data management underpins the University’s strategic commitment to open research, which, in turn, is a key driver in achieving the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals’ call for public access to information for all (Goal 16, Target 10). The University’s Code of Research Good Practice formalises the importance of best practice in the management of research data and research related records to the University’s commitment to supporting “a research environment that is underpinned by a culture of integrity”.1 The University of Westminster’s Digital Strategy commits to ensuring that safe, secure, and compliant systems and processes exist for the collection, storage, sharing, and preservation of research data.\\n\\nIn parallel, research funders and sponsors have clear policies relating to research data management and open research data. UKRI’s commitment to making publicly funded research data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable in line with the FAIR Data Principles is affirmed by the Common principles on research data (RCUK, 2011) and the Concordat on Open Research Data (HEFCE, UKRI, UUK, and Wellcome, 2016). Horizon Europe (European Commission, 2022) requires “open access to research data under the principle ‘as open as possible, as closed as necessary’”.2 It is recognised that researchers cannot meet open research data expectations without support from their institution.\\n\\nManaging research data effectively:\\n\\nincreases the visibility and integrity of scholarly research;\\nmaximises the utility and reusability of research data;\\nmaximises the potential for collaboration;\\nmitigates against the risk of accidental loss of research data;\\nmitigates against the accidental or inappropriate release of personal data and sensitive information;\\nensures the long-term preservation of and access to research datasets;\\nenables research data to be shared as a public good.\\n\\nThis policy outlines the obligations of and key expectations for researchers and the institution in relation to the management and preservation of research data and research related records created at the University of Westminster. This policy clarifies the responsibilities of both individual researchers and the institution in relation to good research data management and support.\\n\\n### 2. Purpose\\n\\nThe aims of this policy are to:\\n\\n1. promote best practice in research data management in accordance with the FAIR Data Principles to ensure that research data and research related records are managed and preserved in a manner that maximises the transparency, integrity, quality, and reproducibility of scholarly research, and ensures the long-term accessibility and reusability of research data;\\n\\n2. to make research data created at the University of Westminster as open as possible unless there are valid reasons not to do so, in line with the University of Westminster Code of Research Good Practice;\\n3. to support and encourage data leadership across the University, in line with the University of Westminster’s Digital Strategy;\\n4. to highlight that responsibility for research data management falls within the remit of a range of stakeholders across the institution who must work together to build a cohesive support service that puts researchers at its centre.\\n\\n### 3. Scope\\n\\nThis policy covers the management, retention, and preservation of all research data and research related records created, collected, or re-used at the University of Westminster, including the documentation of practice based research. This policy applies to all University colleagues and doctoral researchers who conduct research. This policy does not apply to taught course students; however, taught course students are encouraged to adopt best practice in research data management.\\n\\nThis policy does not cover records created in the course of the University of Westminster’s business, which are covered by the University Records Management Policy, the University Records and Archives Collection & Acquisition Policy, and the University Records and Archives Digital Preservation Policy. This policy should be read in conjunction with relevant copyright, data protection, and FOI legislation as well as relevant institutional policies, such as those relating to information security, research ethics and integrity, intellectual property and use, the Human Tissue Act, and Security Sensitive Research. Relevant institutional policies and codes of practice are listed in Appendix B.\\n\\n### 4. Institutional responsibilities\\n\\n4.1 It is recognised that institutional responsibility for research data management (RDM) falls within the remit of a range of stakeholders across the institution, including but not limited to Information Systems and Support, Library & Archives Services, and the Research and Knowledge Exchange Office.\\n\\n4.2 The University (data controller) is responsible for:\\n\\n1. ensuring that researchers have access to the necessary infrastructure and skills to manage their research data appropriately;\\n2. providing appropriate systems and infrastructure, supporting documentation, and services;\\n3. providing, maintaining, and updating relevant online guidance to support researchers and doctoral researchers to appropriately manage their research data before, during, and after the completion of research projects;\\n4. maintaining a programme of training;\\n5. maintaining an RDM support service;\\n6. promoting the RDM Policy and raising awareness of best practice in research data management.\\n\\n4.3 The University will develop an associated communications strategy to identify channels for and deliver a programme of advocacy and awareness-raising, in consultation with relevant stakeholders.\\n\\n4.4 The University will continue to engage with all stakeholders in the ongoing development of the RDM service via the Research Data Management Working Group to ensure that strategic priorities for the RDM service are aligned with institutional goals and stakeholder needs.\\n\\n4.5 The University will maintain an associated RDM Roadmap to identify priorities and associated milestones for the ongoing development and implementation of the RDM service.\\n\\n### 5. Researcher responsibilities\\n\\n5.1 Researchers are responsible for familiarising themselves and complying with the relevant RDM, record-keeping, open data, and retention requirements of research funders, sponsors, publishers, and other relevant external stakeholders, as well as the relevant legal, ethical, and regulatory frameworks governing the processing of personal data and sensitive research data.\\n\\n5.2 At a minimum, researchers should recognise the importance of research data planning and management in research design, research and knowledge exchange ethics review processes, and active post-award management.\\n\\n5.3 Individual researchers, or, the Principal Investigator in the case of collaborative research projects (data creators) are responsible for making appropriate decisions and applying best practice in relation to the management of their research data and research related records.\\n\\n5.4 Doctoral supervisors are responsible for ensuring that doctoral researchers (data creators) have access to the necessary skills and infrastructure to manage their research data appropriately.\\n\\n5.5 Researchers should ensure at the beginning of any research project that there is clarity about data ownership and data management responsibilities and that these are documented in any associated data management plan and/or collaboration agreement.\\n\\n5.6 Researchers are responsible for making appropriate appraisal decisions in relation to the retention, transference of ownership, or destruction of research data held in the University’s storage environments if/ when they leave the University, as per the HR Leavers Checklist. Responsibility for curatorial decisions thereafter (such as those relating to the deletion or migration of data) lies with the line manager or Director of Studies (in the case of doctoral researchers). Ultimate responsibility lies with the Head of School.\\n\\n### 6. Key expectations\\n\\n6.1 Researchers must complete a data management plan (DMP) for all research projects where a research funder or sponsor requires a DMP. All research would benefit from research data management planning, and researchers are strongly encouraged to complete a DMP before the commencement of any research activity.\\n\\n6.2 Researchers should familiarise themselves with University RDM solutions in order to make appropriate decisions in relation to the storage and management of active research data and research related records.\\n\\n6.3 Researchers should identify research data and research related records for preservation beyond the lifetime of research projects by engaging in an appropriate selection and appraisal process.\\n\\n6.4 Researchers who create websites to gather, process, or disseminate research data, activities, or outputs must plan how they will preserve the website at the end of the research project. The University cannot guarantee the long-term sustainability of a project website and reserves the right to take websites that pose a security or regulatory compliance risk offline, as per the IT Acceptable Use Policy.\\n\\n6.5 Researchers should deposit research data selected for preservation in an appropriate research data or software repository, in line with the FAIR Data Principles, and normally no later than the publication of any associated research outputs. Researchers are encouraged to deposit research data from funded projects, practice based outputs, doctoral theses, and orphan datasets not preserved elsewhere in WestminsterResearch via the VRE.\\n\\n6.6 Researchers must transfer research related records selected for retention to University Records & Archives on completion of the research project.\\n\\n6.7 Researchers are strongly encouraged to make research data metadata records publicly accessible, even when the research data are not available, or no longer available.\\n\\n6.8 Researchers should register all research data or software preserved in external repositories as an output in WestminsterResearch via the VRE as soon as practicable. Researchers are strongly encouraged to link preserved datasets to their publication record using their author ORCiD.\\n\\n6.9 Researchers should make research data as open as possible, except in circumstances where there are valid reasons not to do so. Doctoral researchers are encouraged to share research data as openly as possible alongside their open access doctoral theses, except in circumstances where there are valid reasons not to do so. It is recognised that there may be legal, ethical, commercial, political, environmental, or cultural reasons for not sharing data, including but not restricted to personal data protection, copyright/ IP, and the protection of marginalised communities. It is also recognised, in line with The CARE Principles, that Indigenous Peoples hold the authority to make decisions about sharing Indigenous data.\\n\\n6.10 Researchers must include a data access statement in research outputs where mandated by a research funder, sponsor, or publisher, even where there are no research data associated with the output or the research data are inaccessible. Researchers are strongly recommended to include a data access statement in all research outputs, even where there are no research data associated with the output or the research data are inaccessible.\\n\\n6.11 Researchers should establish an appropriate date (x-years post-project) at which to review preserved research data for further retention or destruction.\\n\\n### 7. Policy implementation and review\\n\\nThis policy updates the University of Westminster Research Data Management Policy 2017.\\n\\nThis policy was written in April 2022 and was approved by Academic Council on 07/12/2022 after consultation with the following committees and working groups:\\n\\nResearch Data Management Working Group (April 2022)\\nGraduate School Board (May 2022)\\nUniversity Research & Knowledge Exchange Ethics Committee (June 2022) Research Committee (June 2022)\\nResearch & Knowledge Exchange Steering Committee (September 2022).\\n\\nThis policy comes into effect 08/12/2022. This policy should be reviewed in 2025.\\n\\n## Appendix A: Glossary\\n\\nA Data Access Statement, or Data Availability Statement, is a statement appended to a research publication that describes where the underlying research materials associated with a paper are available, and how they can be accessed, including any restrictions on access and reuse.\\n\\nA Data Management Plan (DMP) is a formal document that describes how research data and materials will be managed or curated during and beyond the lifetime of a research project.\\n\\nDigital preservation refers to the series of managed activities necessary to ensure continued access to digital materials. These actions include but are not limited to the appropriate selection and appraisal of research data and research related records for preservation.\\n\\nFAIR data are those research data which are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. FAIR data are not equivalent to open data, as research data can be FAIR even when access is restricted.\\n\\nMetadata are information that describes data. Metadata provide context and meaning to your research data or research materials and enable you and others to make sense of and reuse your data in the future. At a minimum, your documentation or metadata should clearly tell the story of how you created, gathered, and used your research data or research materials and for what purpose.\\n\\nOpen data are those research data that are discoverable, publicly accessible, and reusable.\\n\\nA Persistent Identifier (PID) is a unique, stable, permanent reference to a digital object. PIDs include ORCiDs for authors, and DOIs for journal articles and datasets. They provide a reliable way to track citations and reuse, facilitating the discoverability and citation of research.\\n\\nResearch data management (RDM) concerns the organisation of research data and materials throughout the research lifecycle. It includes “data collection or acquisition, organisation, curation, storage, (long-term) preservation, security, quality assurance, allocation of persistent identifiers (PIDs), provision of metadata in line with disciplinary requirements, licencing, and rules and procedures for sharing of data. RDM is an essential element in any project that generates, collects or re-uses data”.3\\n\\nResearch data are any digital object created or collected during the course of research. These might include documents, still images, video and audio files, spreadsheets, software, computer code, databases or websites, in addition to physical objects such as sketchbooks, diaries, lab notebooks, portfolios, models, other artefacts, and includes the documentation of practice based research.\\n\\nResearch related records are physical or digital records created by a researcher in the course of research and relating to the administration, management, and delivery of research projects, activities and outputs. These may include consent forms, procedures, protocols, approvals, provenance information, laboratory notebooks, project reports, administrative or financial records, data management plans, primary datasets, databases, or samples.\\n\\nAppendix B: relevant internal policies, codes of practice, and frameworks\\n\\nBeing Westminster: Our Strategy 2022-2029\\nUniversity of Westminster Research Strategy\\nUniversity of Westminster Knowledge Exchange Strategy\\nUniversity of Westminster Digital Strategy - ‘Digital Westminster’\\nUniversity of Westminster Strategy for Research Development and Support 2020-2023\\nUniversity of Westminster Code of Research Good Practice 2020-2021\\nUniversity of Westminster Code of Practice Governing the Ethical Conduct of Research 2020-21\\nHuman Tissue Act SOP\\nSecurity Sensitive Research SOP\\nOpen Access Policy\\nUniversity of Westminster Records Management Policy\\nUniversity Records and Archives Digital Preservation Policy\\nUniversity Records and Archives Collections & Acquisition Policy\\nIntellectual Property Policy\\nInformation Security Policy\\nIT Acceptable Use Policy\\nIT Asset Management Policy\\nUniversity of Westminster Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) Policy\\nUniversity personal data protection policy\\nHR Leavers Checklist for Managers',\n",
       " '# POLICY FOR THE EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF RESEARCH DATA\\n\\n### Contact Officer\\n\\nDirector of Research\\n\\n## Purpose\\n\\nThis policy sets out the responsibilities of researchers in managing research data from the planning stage through collection and storage of research data, to the longer term archiving of this data. It starts from the position that research data should be made openly accessible to others subject to legislation, ethical considerations, intellectual property rights and limitations set by any sponsor. The policy also establishes the responsibilities of the University in enabling the effective management of research data and for the longer term curation of this data.\\n\\nThe University seeks to align its approach to research data management with RCUK’s Common Principles on Data Policy and the Concordat on Open Research Data.\\n\\n## Overview\\n\\nThis document is intended to set out how researchers should conduct themselves in managing their research data. It focuses on 6 key stages in the data management process: research data management planning; data generation/collection; data processing; data storage; data preservation; and data access. For each stage it establishes clear responsibilities for the researcher but also for the University to enable effective management and curation of research data.\\n\\nIn terms of the University’s responsibilities as set out in this Policy, these are aspirational. A separate implementation plan will set out how it will meet these aspirations and the timescale for this. Further, in line with the policy, detailed guidance will be separately provided for researchers on each of the 5 stages drawing on good practice in the sector and the detailed guidance provided by the Digital Curation Centre, the UK Data Service and the UK Data Archive.\\n\\n## Scope\\n\\nThe policy applies to all staff and research students at the University engaged in research, and any individual who is not a member of staff or student at the University but is undertaking research using University premises and facilities, and/or in the University’s name. For the purpose of the policy, these groups are referred to collectively as “researchers”.\\n\\n# The Policy\\n\\n### 1. Introduction\\n\\n1.1 The University of Worcester recognises research data as a valuable institutional asset, and the role of research data management in underpinning research excellence and integrity. The University endorses the RCUK Common Principles on Data Management and the Concordat on Open Data.\\n1.2 Research data will be managed in line with funder requirements as well as University policy and other relevant regulations and legislation.\\n1.3 The ownership of data generated by researchers at the University will normally be determined by the University’s Intellectual Property Policy unless the terms of research grants or contracts determine otherwise.\\n1.4 Research Data are defined as any datasets, texts, images, recordings or artefacts generated through the research process which underpin the findings of a research project.\\n\\n1.5 Research data should be:\\n\\nGenerated subject to the highest standards of integrity;\\nAccurate, complete, authentic and reliable;\\nStored securely and safely during the lifetime of the project in a manner that is compliant with legal obligations, relevant University policies and guidelines, and where applicable the requirements of funding bodies or collaborators; Retained or securely disposed of at the end of a project in accordance with University policy and any legal, ethical, funder or collaborator requirements – the normal expectation is that\\nresearch data will be retained for a minimum 10 year period;\\nMade identifiable and accessible for others, where it is retained beyond the lifetime of the project, and where this is appropriate and practicable.\\n\\n### 2. Responsibilities\\n\\n2.1 This policy establishes the responsibilities of the researcher and of the University in 6 key stages of the data management cycle:\\n\\nData Management Planning\\nGenerating data\\nProcessing data\\nData Storage\\nData Preservation\\nSharing data\\n\\n2.2 Responsibility for research data management lies with the Principal Investigator(s) or project lead on any research project.\\n\\n2.3 Where research is undertaken by a student it is the responsibility of the staff member supervising their project to ensure that the student has a clear understanding of appropriate research data management practice in line with this policy.\\n\\n#### Data Management Planning\\n\\n2.4 Many funders now expect researchers to produce a data management plan as part of any application. It is good practice for all researchers to develop such a plan, whether applying for funding or not, although the scale and detail of the plan may vary dependent on the nature of the research.\\n\\n2.5 Researchers are expected to:\\n\\nProduce a data management plan which as a minimum identifies\\n\\no what data is to be collected\\no how it will be collected\\no how it will be stored during the project and in what form(s)\\no ethical issues relating to collection and storage of the data (and how these will be addressed)\\no what will happen to the data at the end of the project, i.e. what will be retained, what will be disposed of\\no ethical issues relating to retention of data (and how these will be addressed)\\no how retained data will be stored and in what form\\no how others may gain access to retained data Share the data management plan with other researchers on the project for comment and revision as appropriate\\nIncorporate details of the data management plan into Participant Information Sheets Keep the data management plan under review through the lifetime of the project and beyond.\\n\\n2.6 The University will:\\n\\nProvide training for researchers on developing a data management plan Provide written guidance for developing a data management plan (to include data management plan templates for different funders and for UG and PG students).\\n\\n#### Generating Data\\n\\n2.7 Data is generated by a range of methodologies, often dependent on the subject area. This data may be primary (i.e. data collected by experimentation, survey, observation, interview or generated through creative work) or it may be data derived from a larger existing dataset, document archive or collection of texts.\\n\\n2.8 Researchers are expected to:\\n\\nGenerate data using robust and appropriate methods;\\nEnsure that data is generated subject to the highest standards of integrity;\\nEnsure that appropriate consents are gained from participants;\\nEnsure that necessary permissions are gained from owners of existing data.\\n\\n2.9 The University will:\\n\\nProvide support, guidance and training for researchers (appropriate to their experience) in methodology, ethics and integrity.\\n\\n#### Processing Data\\n\\n2.10 The “raw” data generated through research is normally subject to some form of processing. It may be entered into a database, digitised, transcribed, transliterated or translated. During this process it may be checked and cleaned; it may be subject to annotation and in some instances anonymisation.\\n\\n2.11 It is essential that data is processed to the highest possible standards to ensure the integrity and quality of the data.\\n\\n2.12 Researchers are expected to:\\n\\nProduce processed data that is accurate, complete, authentic and reliable;\\nProcess data ensuring that all ethical requirements are met.\\n\\n2.13 The University will:\\n\\nProvide support, guidance and training for researchers (appropriate to their experience) in processing data.\\n\\n#### Data Storage\\n\\n2.14 All data generated in the course of a research project, both processed and unprocessed, should normally be stored securely and safely. This is a legislative requirement for personal data but it is recommended that all data is treated in this manner to ensure the integrity of that data. However, there may be contexts where this is neither practicable nor desirable, e.g. where the “data” generated are artefacts such as sculptures or paintings presented in a public space.\\n\\n2.15 Researchers are expected to:\\n\\nStore all data, unprocessed and processed, whether digital or in some other form, securely and safely for the lifetime of the project unless there is a clear rationale why this is not possible or desirable\\nUse digital storage that is fit for purpose, both in terms of its security and its size - for this reason the robust, managed storage provided by the University is the recommended option Back up all digital data and hold copies of data in other forms as far as that is possible and practicable on a regular basis\\n\\n2.16 The University will:\\n\\nProvide appropriate digital storage options and where appropriate hard storage options for\\nresearchers\\nProvide detailed guidance on legislative requirements for storage of data\\nProvide detailed guidance on storage options\\n\\n#### Data Preservation\\n\\n2.17 High quality research data are a public good and therefore should be preserved and made accessible to others unless there is a clear reason not to. Reasons include but are not limited to:\\n\\nConsent for participation was subject to data not being preserved\\nEthical considerations, such as need to ensure anonymity, argue against preserving the data\\nThe data is insufficiently robust or meaningful to warrant preservation\\nThe data does not have long-term value\\n\\n2.18 The length of time data must be preserved may be determined by a funder; where this time period is not defined by the funder or the research is unfunded, it is recommended that data is preserved for a minimum of 10 years.\\n\\n2.19 It may not be practicable or appropriate to preserve all data generated or processed in the course of a project and decisions will need to be made as to what data should be preserved. This decision should be in accordance with any legal, ethical, funder or collaborator requirements. Keeping these requirements in mind, preserved data should allow a clear assessment of any published work arising from the research.\\n\\n2.20 Researchers are expected to:\\n\\nIdentify if, how and for how long data will be preserved at the planning stage and\\ncommunicate this to participants;\\nPreserve appropriate data that belongs to the University (subject to any legal, ethical, funder or collaborator requirements and the exclusions in 2.17);\\nPreserve appropriate data that belongs to the funder (subject to any legal, ethical, funder or collaborator requirements and the obligations set out in the contract or research\\nagreement);\\nTransfer digital data to a suitable file format to ensure that it is accessible in the long term; this will often mean using non-proprietary file formats\\nMigrate data to a suitable repository; this may be a University repository and/or an external data repository (general or subject-based).\\n\\n2.21 The University will:\\n\\nProvide detailed guidance on data preservation including information about appropriate file formats Develop systems to enable its researchers to preserve data for the required period\\n\\n### Data Sharing\\n\\n2.22 Research data are preserved so that outputs from the research can be assessed against this data but also so that this data can be re-used by others.\\n\\n2.23 It is important that preserved data is easily discoverable and that it is accompanied by sufficient metadata to enable other researchers to understand the research and re-use potential of the data.\\n\\n2.24 Researchers are expected to:\\n\\nProduce metadata and documentation to describe the data (sufficient to understand what research data exists, why, when and how it was generated), to identify who owns the data\\n\\nand where it is archived, and to set out how the data can be accessed and any restrictions on access.\\n\\n2.25 The University will:\\n\\nCreate a catalogue of data produced by its researchers including this metadata, to include a direct link to this data where this is appropriate and possible (e.g. through a digital object identifier).\\n\\n### 3. Oversight and implementation\\n\\n3.1 The Director of Research will have oversight of this Policy.\\n\\n3.2 The Research Committee will approve and annually review an implementation plan for this policy, taking advice as appropriate from the Ethics and Research Governance Committee.\\n\\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Date Approved</td><td>10th February 2016</td></tr><tr><td>Approval Authority</td><td>Academic Board</td></tr><tr><td>Date of Commencement</td><td>27th April 2016</td></tr><tr><td>AmendmentDates</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>DateforNextReview</td><td>27th April 2016</td></tr><tr><td>Related Policies, Procedures, Guidance, Forms or Templates</td><td>Ethics Policy GuidelinesandProceduresforGoodResearchPractice</td></tr><tr><td>Policy/Policies Superseded by this document</td><td>None</td></tr></table></body></html>',\n",

It is also essential for enabling and safeguarding the longevity and continuing intelligibility of research data.\\n\\n1.2 The University supports the Concordat on Open Research Data and the UKRI Common Principles on Research Data and acknowledges the outputs of University research as a public good, produced in the public interest and for societal benefit.\\n\\n1.3 The University is committed to the values, principles and culture of open research, as set out in the Open Research Statement. This includes open access to research data, wherever this is appropriate, ensuring that a wide range of audiences can freely discover, engage and reuse its world-class research.\\n\\n## 2. Purpose of policy\\n\\n2.1 This policy is intended to help promote good practice in research data management, to foster responsibility for data management, and to ensure the sharing of eligible research data with as few restrictions as possible, while at the same time respecting concerns in relation to privacy, safety, security and commercial interests.\\n\\n2.2 A particular aim is that research data is:\\n\\nstored in a secure and safe manner;\\nidentifiable, retrievable and available when needed (and as appropriate);\\nan accurate, complete, reliable and coherent representation of the materials used/collected; kept in a manner that is compliant with legal and ethical obligations, University policy and, where applicable, the requirements of funding bodies;\\nable to be made available to others in line with appropriate ethical, data sharing, FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) and open access principles.\\n\\n2.3 The deliberate or reckless mismanagement of research data and/or primary materials constitutes unacceptable research conduct and should be reported in line with the University Research Misconduct Policy and Procedure or the Speak Up (public interest disclosure) Policy and Procedure.\\n\\n## 3. Definitions\\n\\n3.1 For the purpose of this policy, the following terms may be defined as:\\n\\nResearch data: the recorded information (regardless of the form or the media in which it may exist) necessary to support or validate a research project’s observations, findings or outputs. Researcher: a member of the University, including staff and postgraduate researchers, or a person affiliated with the University, including visitors and collaborators, who conducts research for, on behalf of, or in association with the University; on University premises; or using University facilities.\\n\\n## 4. Scope\\n\\n4.1 This policy applies to all research conducted by University staff and postgraduate researchers, and those who are conducting research on behalf of the University.\\n\\n4.2 The Policy does not apply to taught postgraduate and undergraduate students, except in exceptional circumstances, including but not limited to, where research findings are included in published research outputs.\\n\\n## 5. Researcher responsibilities\\n\\n5.1 Principal Investigators and project leads have overall responsibility for effective data management during research projects. However, all researchers have a personal responsibility to effectively manage the research data generated within or obtained from their research, and must act in accordance with this policy.\\n\\n5.2 Responsibility for ensuring the effective day-to-day management of research data lies with the researcher with overall responsibility for a research project, including by their research groups. This includes understanding and complying with any provisions regarding the ownership, preservation and dissemination of research data of research contracts with or grants to the University.\\n\\n5.3 In line with good practice, researchers are strongly encouraged to routinely prepare, maintain and adhere to a data management plan for their research projects. Data management plans should address the capture, management, integrity, confidentiality, retention, ownership, sharing and publication of research data, including compliance with relevant legal and ethical frameworks. Plans must also adhere to any funder requirements where these exist.\\n\\n5.4 Researchers will identify the resources required to effectively manage research data and will seek, where possible, to recover the direct costs of managing research data and any work needed to make the data available for sharing from their research funder.\\n\\n5.5 Researchers will protect confidential, personal and sensitive research data in accordance with legal and ethical requirements related to the research they conduct. Legal, ethical and commercial constraints on the sharing of research data must be considered at the initiation of the research process and throughout the research data lifecycle, and will normally be described in a data management plan.\\n\\n5.6 Researchers will preserve and provide appropriate access to their research data for as long as it is of continuing value to the researcher and the wider research community, and as long as specified by research funders, patent law, legislative and other regulatory requirements.\\n\\n5.7 Researchers should offer the research data they have selected for preservation and sharing to an appropriate data repository, along with sufficient descriptive metadata and documentation to ensure that it can be found and understood. Where research data is deposited somewhere other than the University’s data repository (Research Data York), a dataset record should also be created in the University’s Research Information System (PURE) which describes and points to the data.\\n\\n5.8 Researchers must include a data access statement in their published research outputs which clearly describes how and on what terms any supporting data may be accessed.\\n\\n5.9 Technicians, professional and support staff instrumental in contributing to the collection and/or generation of research data should be acknowledged and their contribution specified in descriptive metadata and in data access statements.\\n\\n5.10 Researchers must securely dispose of research data identified for deletion or destruction, in accordance with legal, ethical, research funder and collaborator requirements and with particular concern for the confidentiality and security of the data.\\n\\n5.11 Where research is undertaken by postgraduate researchers, it is the responsibility of the staff member supervising their project to ensure that the postgraduate researcher has a clear understanding of their research data management responsibilities and engages with training and development as necessary. Supervisors should work with the postgraduate researcher to determine which research data is selected for archiving and sharing and to decide an appropriate route to achieve this.\\n\\n## 6. University responsibilities\\n\\n6.1 The University acknowledges its obligations under research funders’ data policies and codes of practice to ensure that sound systems are in place to promote and reinforce good practice in research data management.\\n\\n6.2 The University will provide:\\n\\nresearchers with access to training, support, advice and information on all aspects of research data management;\\n\\naccess to services and facilities for the storage, backup, registration, deposit and discovery of research data that allow researchers to meet their requirements under this policy and those of the funders for their research; the necessary resources to enable the provision of these services, facilities and training.\\n\\n## 7.

The University of Bayreuth recognizes that structured, comprehensively documented and easily retrievable research data is an essential part of a research project. Well managed research data enable the reproducibility of research processes and their results.\\n\\nResearch Data Management (RDM) is part of the University of Bayreuth\\'s 2025 Structure and Development Plan1. It is supported by corresponding measures initiated by the Vice President for Digitalization, Innovation & Sustainability and the Vice President for Research & Junior Scholars, as well as the central institutes IT Service Centre, University Library, and Research Support Office.\\n\\nThe aim of the University of Bayreuth’s RDM Policy is to raise awareness of the importance of research data and to provide researchers and early-career scholars at the University of Bayreuth with information on how to handle research data, thereby contributing to a quality-oriented, accessible, and sustainable research environment. The Policy follows the recommendations made by the German Science and Humanities Council (2012)2 and the German Rectors\\' Conference (2014)3 as well as the \"Guidelines for Handling Research Data\"4 and the \"Guidelines for Safeguarding Good Research Practice\"5 published by the German Research Foundation (DFG).\\n\\nThe University of Bayreuth has formulated the present Policy on the basis of the first version of a RDM Policy published on 8 November 20166 and in accordance with The University of Bayreuth’s Statutes for safeguarding the standards of good scientific practice and handling scientific misconduct7. In addition, the Open Access Strategy of the University of Bayreuth8 and the University of Bayreuth’s Strategy for Handling Intellectual Property (IP) in Knowledge and Technology Transfer9 needs to be observed as well.\\n\\n### 1. Scope of validity\\n\\nThe RDM Policy is aimed at all researchers at the University of Bayreuth. RDM at the University of Bayreuth is carried out in accordance with the applicable laws on the protection of persons and intellectual property, as well as the \"Statutes of the University of Bayreuth for safeguarding the standards of good scientific practice and handling scientific misconduct\"7 and is subject to specific agreements with third parties. The Policy is supplemented by the \"Guidelines for Research Data Management at the University of Bayreuth\"10 .\\n\\nIn the case of research collaborations, this RDM Policy is valid unless equivalent or stricter regulations are applied. If a project-specific policy is developed as part of a research project that contains equivalent or stricter regulations, it takes precedence over this RDM Policy.\\n\\n### 2. Legal and ethical aspects\\n\\nCopyright law guarantees the protection of intellectual property. Whether research data are subject to the protection of copyright law depends on whether the requirements for the level of intellectual creation or the requirements of database copyright are met.\\n\\nIntellectual property rights and rights to research data are generally defined by specific agreements (e.g. work agreements, grant agreements, consortium agreements, or agreements of contract research).\\n\\nIn the area of RDM, the University of Bayreuth and its researchers observe the applicable laws for the protection of persons and intellectual property (General Data Protection Regulation, copyright law) as well as ethical, legal, and confidentiality concerns (e.g. patent law). In particular, this includes any type of collection and processing11 of personal data, which is only carried out if\\n\\nthe person concerned has given their consent to the collection or processing of their personal data for one or more specific purposes;\\ndata collection or processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the person concerned is party, or in order to take steps at the request of the person concerned prior to entering into a contract; data collection or processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the responsible person is subject;\\ndata collection or processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the person concerned or of another natural person;\\ndata collection or processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the responsible person.\\n\\n### 3. Handling research data\\n\\nThroughout the entire research data cycle - from data acquisition to publication and long-term availability - research data should be handled and documented in accordance with the established and recognized rules and standards in the respective subject area. In accordance with the FAIR principles12, research data should be findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable.\\n\\nAll researchers at the University of Bayreuth determine within the legal framework when and under what conditions their research data will be made accessible. The University of Bayreuth recommends that its members work towards making research data and software created in the research process, as well as scientific publications, publicly accessible as early as possible in accordance with the statement of the G8 science ministers dated 12 June 201313, the information sheet \"Research Data Management\" of the priority initiative Digital Information of the Alliance of German Science Organizations14, and the Open Access Strategy of the University of Bayreuth15. To this end, the scope, timing, and appropriate licensing conditions for research data must be defined in accordance with intellectual property rights and on the condition that no third-party rights, statutory provisions, data rights, or other property rights conflict with this.\\n\\nResearch data should be stored with suitable metadata in a trustworthy, subject-specific repository or data centre/archive system or the institutional research data repository of the University of Bayreuth RDSpace@UBT16 for the long term and made as openly accessible as possible. To ensure long-term citability of research data, the use of persistent identifiers (e.g. DOI) is recommended. This makes the origin of reused data traceable, and the data source or the data provider can be credited.\\n\\nResearch data and documents that ensure the documentation and reproducibility of the results should be stored and kept accessible for as long as is necessary in accordance with legal requirements or the requirements of research funders within the framework of the applicable legal and contractual provisions. The minimum retention period for research data and documents is 10 years after publication by assignment of a DOI. As a rule, research data should be kept for at least 10 years after publication of the research findings or after completion of the research project (whichever is the later).\\n\\nIf research data and associated documents are to be deleted or destroyed after the retention period has expired, or for legal or ethical reasons, these measures need to take legal and ethical considerations into account. The deletion must be documented and justified. When deciding whether to retain or delete data, the interests and contractual provisions of third-party funders and other parties, in particular contributors and cooperation partners, must be taken into account. Aspects of security and confidentiality must be considered.\\n\\n### 4. Responsibilities\\n\\nThe University of Bayreuth and its researchers are responsible for RDM in accordance with “The University of Bayreuth’s Statutes for safeguarding the standards of good scientific practice and handling scientific misconduct\"17.\\n\\n#### 4(a) Responsibilities of the researchers\\n\\nAll researchers at the University of Bayreuth\\n\\ncomply with good scientific practice and observe the applicable legal provisions and research ethics requirements in addition to the present Policy when conducting RDM;\\ncollect, document, store, and archive research data and associated relevant documents in accordance with the FAIR principles and subject-specific standards. This also includes agreements on processes and responsibilities in joint research projects. Such information can be part of a data management plan (DMP) that documents the collection, management, storage, use, and publication of the data used;\\nplan, if necessary in coordination with the project managers, the (subsequent) re-use of their data, especially after the project has been completed. This includes both the determination of usage and exploitation rights, including the granting of corresponding licenses, as well as the agreement regarding data storage and archiving after leaving the University of Bayreuth.\\n\\n#### 4(b) Responsibilities of the University of Bayreuth\\n\\nThe University of Bayreuth\\n\\npromotes compliance with the standards of good scientific practice. To this end, it offers training and continuing education measures for members of the university as well as support and advice in the context of RDM;\\ndevelops strategies and provides services and infrastructures for saving, securely storing, and long-term archiving of research data in order to ensure access to research data during and after the completion of research projects;\\nsupports its organizational units in implementing RDM and provides appropriate resources for RDM and related services, infrastructure, and employee training;\\nprovides access to the services and infrastructures described above so that researchers can comply with the requirements of third-party funding bodies and other legal entities and fulfill their responsibilities as described in the present RDM Policy. Specific requirements must be coordinated and, if necessary, additionally financed.\\n\\n### 5. Validity and verification\\n\\nThe University of Bayreuth’s Policy for Research Data Management was adopted by the Senate of the University of Bayreuth on 13 December 2023 in Bayreuth. It comes into force immediately and is valid for five years after coming into force. The Policy will be reviewed by the responsible university committees at the end of the five years at the latest and updated if necessary.\\n\\n### Glossary\\n\\n#### FAIR principles\\n\\nThe FAIR principles were drawn up by a stakeholder group consisting of representatives from science, industry, funding organizations, and scientific publishers and were first published in 2016.18 They define international principles for sustainable reusable research data with the main aim of optimizing the preparation of research data so that they are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable.\\n\\n#### Researchers\\n\\nResearchers are all members of the University of Bayreuth who are actively conducting research. In addition to academic staff, this also includes students and non-academic staff, insofar as they are active in research.\\n\\nThe term also includes persons who are not directly affiliated with the University of Bayreuth, but who use the facilities and infrastructure of the University of Bayreuth for research projects. This group of persons includes visiting researchers, freelance staff, scholarship holders, cooperation partners, and persons who are pursuing a doctoral or postdoctoral thesis supervised by a member of the University of Bayreuth, even if they are not members of the University of Bayreuth themselves.\\n\\n#### Research data\\n\\nAll data that are generated, collected, observed, simulated, or derived in the research process are regarded as research data. Typical examples of research data are measurement data, laboratory values, audiovisual information, texts, survey results, objects from collections, methodological test procedures or simulations, source code, and protocols. The range of data types reflects the diversity and methodological development of scientific disciplines and research procedures. Research data can arise in various forms during the research project (different format variants of primary data, processed data including negative or ambiguous results, shared data, published data) and can be provided with different access authorizations, e.g. as open, restricted, or non-public data. For the provision and subsequent use of research data, it is necessary to document the context in which the data were generated and to document (as metadata) the tools and methods used in this process.\\n\\nResearch data management\\n\\nResearch data management encompasses all measures for the quality assurance of research data during their life cycle; from the planning and implementation of the research project, to the generation, documentation and processing of data, to the assigning of metadata, to data storage during the research project, and to long-term data storage after the research has been completed. RDM also sets out how accountability, completeness, authenticity, integrity, confidentiality, publication, registration, and access to data are ensured and managed.\\n\\n#### Metadata\\n\\nMetadata is descriptive or contextual information about the associated primary research data. Metadata can be indexed, making it easier to archive and find the described data. Metadata can be divided into different categories. Repositories distinguish, for example\\n\\n- bibliographic metadata (e.g. title, author, abstract),\\n- structural metadata (relationships between objects; e.g. references, versions),\\n- administrative metadata (authorizations/status; e.g. access authorizations, embargo), and - technical metadata (data analyzed by the system; e.g. file size and format, checksums, modification date).',\n",
       " '# Research data management policy of Saarland University\\n\\nVersion 0.2 | Digitalization and Sustainability unit | 30 January 2023\\n\\nDefinition..\\n1 Scope. 2\\n2 Research data management. 3\\n2.1 Management of research data 3\\n2.2 Storage and publication of research data. 4\\n\\n3 Commencement.\\n\\n## Preamble\\n\\nStructured research data management is one of the central elements of good scientific practice1 and is an important part of open science. Saarland University and its researchers, lecturers and students are committed to the adequate handling of research data in accordance with FAIR principles2 throughout the entire data life cycle from data generation to archiving.\\n\\n## Definition\\n\\nResearch data within the meaning of this policy is understood to mean both genuinely digital data that is collected, generated or obtained during or as a result of research work (which includes, but is not limited to, conducting field or laboratory experiments, conducting experiments, surveys, interviews or the analysis of data), as well as data that are generated in analogue formats or already exist and are digitized in further processing. Research data also includes those data that document the actual data generation and ensure the reproducibility of the data (metadata).\\n\\nDue to the range of disciplines, the resulting research data is heterogeneous with respect to the data types and formats; these can consist, for example, of text modules, survey data, measurement, observation data, databases, questionnaires, protocols, audio data and audio-visual data, as well as simulation data and software source code, provided that this is a central result of scientific research. Here, the data life cycle of research data can have various stations which differ in terms of quality states or processing statuses and are fundamentally classified as open, access-restricted and nonpublic research data depending on their access authorizations. Research data management deals with the organization and documentation of the data, storage, archiving, data security, the protection of personal data as well as publication and sharing with third parties. Adequate and sustainable research data management not only ensures the increased requirements of many third-party funding providers are met as well as developing standards from specialist disciplines taking into account research ethical principles, but also increases the visibility of scientific research and the potential linking of different data sets through the subsequent use of data by researchers.\\n\\n### 1 Scope\\n\\nThis policy is aimed at all researchers, lecturers and students at Saarland University. It applies equally to all persons who conduct research at Saarland University or on its behalf or who use facilities of Saarland University. Any requirements of third-party funding providers with regard to research data management that deviate from this policy shall take precedence. In addition, the regulations of Saarland University regarding data protection and IT security are binding. Laws and regulations relating to the handling of research data, in particular regulations for safeguarding good scientific practice, copyright and related rights, commercial intellectual property rights (patent law) and data protection, remain unaffected and take precedence over the regulations of this policy.\\n\\n### 2 Research data management\\n\\n#### 2.1 Management of research data\\n\\nResearch data management covers the entire life cycle of the research data, from data generation to archiving or re-use and includes both the organization and documentation of the generated data, as well as the storage, backup and accessibility (publication) of the data. Adequate research data management ensures that the data can be processed and interpreted in the context of the research project.\\n\\nSustainable research data management begins before the actual data generation in the context of the creation of a data management plan that takes into account all the necessary resources for both the storage and the management of the data. In particular, the project-related physical storage media must be described in full, including software solutions that are used here, and also any personnel costs or license fees. Where personal data are processed, they must be anonymized or pseudonymized as soon as the research purpose allows. In the case of pseudonymization, the characteristics with which the personal reference can be restored must be stored separately from the research data. In addition, the data management plan contains information on project managers, the use and publication of the data and agreements on authorship and copyright. During the course of the research project, the data management plan is regularly reviewed and, if necessary, updated. Responsibility for the entire research data management as well as the preparation and regular review of the data management plan lies with the respective project managers.\\n\\nThis data management plan must already be drawn up for many funding applications from thirdparty funding providers and submitted upon application, for example under the Horizon 2020 programme . Even without these binding requirements from third parties, Saarland University strongly recommends the early implementation of a suitable storage structure, long-term storage and accessibility of research data and their documentation in a data management plan.\\n\\n#### 2.2 Storage and publication of research data\\n\\nIn the (long-term) storage of research data, it is important to determine which data should be stored at which quality level, whereby reasons for not storing research-relevant data must be documented in writing in accordance with the principles of good scientific practice. After metadata has been attributed, the data should be stored in sustainable, lossless and open data formats on data storage devices and backed up.\\n\\nSaarland University supports researchers in ensuring the broadest possible visibility of their research, as well as the subsequent use of the data. Therefore, the metadata of the research project should always be provided with a unique persistent identifier, for example a DOI. The primary data can also be retrieved and stored in a subject-specific repository. When selecting the publication medium, it is recommended that the data is kept freely available for scientific purposes. This can be done by issuing open licenses for usage rights (e.g. Creative Commons CC-BY for data or GNU Affero General Public License for (software) source code). All data collected must be kept in accordance with the specifications of the sponsors and at least for a period of ten years from the publication of the data or from the date of project completion in accordance with the rules of good scientific practice.  For clinical studies, additional retention periods apply which must be observed accordingly.\\n\\n### 3 Commencement\\n\\nThis policy on research data and research data management was adopted by the Senate of Saarland University in its 15th session on 18 January 2023 and will enter into force the day after its publication in the Saarland University Gazette.',\n",
       " '# Research Data Management Policy of the University of Graz\\n\\nAdopted on 14 February 2019\\n\\n## Overview:\\n\\n1. Preamble\\n2. Scope\\n3. Rights Ownership\\n4. Principles of Research Data Management\\n5. Responsibilities 5.1 Responsibilities of the University 5.2 Responsibilities of Researchers\\n\\nAnnex: Definitions\\n\\n### 1. Preamble\\n\\nThe University of Graz, in line with the direction and aims of EU science policy, acknowledges the fundamental importance of managing research data and other records in ensuring high-quality research, research integrity and good scientific practice, and is committed to pursuing the highest standards. The University of Graz recognises that correct and easily retrievable research data are integral to and provide the foundation for any kind of research activity. Furthermore, research data have a long-term value for research and academia and the potential for widespread use in society.\\n\\n### 2. Scope\\n\\nThis Policy for the management of research data applies to all researchers working at the University of Graz. In cases when research is funded by a third party, any agreements made with that party concerning intellectual property rights, exploitation rights, access rights and the storage of research data will take precedence over the provisions of this Policy. This Policy will be reviewed every three years under the supervision of the Vice Rector for Research and updated as necessary.\\n\\n### 3. Rights Ownership\\n\\nIntellectual property rights (IPR) are defined in the Copyright Act (UrhG) and the University Act 2002 (UG 2002) and may be further elaborated in researchers’ employment contracts with the University of Graz. IPR may also be further defined in additional guidelines and agreements (e.g. grant or consortium agreements). In cases where the IPR belong to the University of Graz, the University has the right to choose how data are published and shared.\\n\\n### 4. Principles of Research Data Management\\n\\nResearch data should be stored in and made available for use through a suitable repository or archiving system and should be provided with persistent identifiers. When depositing data in a repository, researchers are requested to declare their affiliation in accordance with the Affiliation Guidelines of the University of Graz.\\n\\nPreserving the integrity of research data requires that these be stored in a correct, complete, unadulterated and reliable manner. Furthermore, they must be findable, accessible, traceable, interoperable and available for subsequent reuse in accordance with the FAIR principles whenever possible. The stored data shall be dated and, where possible, subsequent changes should be stored separately from the original data.\\n\\nWhen dealing with personal data, the applicable data protection regulations must be observed. Provided this is not prohibited by any third party rights, legal obligations, ethical considerations or rights of ownership, research data should be assigned a licence for open use.\\n\\nThe minimum period for which research data and records must be archived is 10 years after the assignment of a persistent identifier or the publication of related work after completion of the research activity, whichever is later. The administrative documents accompanying the research activities must also be archived.\\n\\nAll legal and ethical considerations must be taken into account whenever research data or records are earmarked for deletion or destruction and this must then proceed in a standardised manner. Principal Investigators or their legal successors must be informed and an offer must be made to transfer the data to them. Any action taken must be documented and be accessible for future audit.\\n\\n### 5. Responsibilities\\n\\nResponsibility for research data management during and after a research activity lies with the University of Graz and its researchers.\\n\\n#### 5.1 Responsibilities of the University\\n\\nThe University of Graz is responsible for:\\n\\na) the provision and operation of a repository for storing, safeguarding and providing access to research data.\\n\\nb) empowering organisational units (especially IT services, the University Library, Research Management and Service, Law and Organisation) and providing appropriate financial means and resources for services related to the storage, retrieval and registration of research data and for staff training.\\n\\nc) providing templates for data management plans and offering training and support to researchers.\\n\\nd) long-term archiving and backup of research data (for at least 10 years).\\n\\ne) enabling access to stored data in consultation with the researchers and in accordance with relevant legal provisions. Where possible, research data should be available on an Open Access basis.\\n\\n#### 5.2 Responsibilities of Researchers\\n\\nResearchers are responsible for:\\n\\na) submitting and updating data management plans (DMPs) for research activities and ensuring registration of and compliance with these. DMPs should describe the following aspects in particular: collecting data, documenting, assigning metadata, archiving, access to and storage of or proper deletion of research data and research-related records. The Principle Investigators are primarily responsible for research data management based on a sound research data management plan.\\n\\nb) planning for possible future uses of the data. This includes defining usage rights and assigning appropriate licences. In particular, rights to re-use or publish research data should not be transferred to third parties, such as commercial publishers or agents, without preserving the rights for open access to and free use of the data.\\n\\nc) storing research data in a repository by no later than the date of completion of the research project.\\n\\nd) complying with all organisational, regulatory, institutional and other contractual and legal requirements.\\n\\ne) managing research data and data sets in accordance with the principles and requirements expressed in this Policy.\\n\\n### Annex: Definitions\\n\\nResearch is defined as any creative and systematically performed work that is carried out with the goal of advancing knowledge, including gaining insights about people, culture and society, and applying this knowledge in new ways.\\n\\nResearchers are individuals who perform research activities at the University of Graz. This includes members of the University as defined in Section 94 of the Universities Act 2002 (UG), i.e. employed staff and doctoral students in their role as early career researchers, as well as individuals who are not affiliated with the University of Graz. Guest researchers and collaborators are also expected to comply with this Policy.\\n\\nResearch data, as used in this Policy, refers to all data produced by researchers in the context of their work that would be considered by members of the profession to be relevant for the replication of results, suitable for reuse by fellow researchers, and for which the University of Graz has curatorial responsibility. In a broader sense, research data includes all information (regardless of form or presentation) that is required to support or validate the development, outcome, observations or findings of a research project and its context. This includes materials of any type created in the course of academic activities, e.g. through digitisation, recordings, studies of source materials, experiments, measurements, surveys or interviews. This also includes software and code. Research data may exist in a range of different forms. Data can pass through various phases over the course of their lifecycle: from raw data, processed data (including “negative” or “inconclusive results”) and shared data to published data and Open Access published data. They can also have different degrees of accessibility (Open Data, Restricted Data, Closed Data).\\n\\n(Research Data) Repositories are managed servers for storing, describing, archiving and publishing digital objects and data. One global registry of research data repositories across all academic disciplines is re3data.org.\\n\\nA persistent identifier is a permanent reference to a document, file, web page or other object. It allows access to a digital object via a persistent link. Examples of persistent identifiers include Digital Object Identifiers (DOI) and Uniform Resource Names (URN).\\n\\nThe “FAIR Data Principles” lay down guidelines that sustainably reusable research data must fulfil and that research data infrastructures should implement within the framework of the services they provide. According to the FAIR principles, data should be \"Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable\".\\n\\nA Principal Investigator is an individual responsible for taking binding decisions and who oversees the funding and expenditures for a particular research project or activity, or a project’s lead researcher.\\n\\nFree licences: A licence is a set of legal terms attached to an original work that serve as an extension of copyright. It defines what may and may not be done with a work, grants permissions, and specifies restrictions. An open or free licence, such as a Creative Commons licence, essentially allows access, reuse and redistribution of a work with few or no restrictions. The precise permissions depend on the full text of the licence being applied.\\n\\nA Data Management Plan (DMP) is a structured guideline (document or online tool) which depicts the entire lifecycle of the data and which can be updated as needed. Data management plans must ensure that research data are traceable, available, authentic, citable and properly stored and that they comply with clearly defined legal parameters and appropriate measures for subsequent use. Ideally, DMPs should be delivered in a machine-actionable format.\\n\\nMetadata are data about data that describe characteristics and properties of objects, works and information.\\n\\nScientific integrity and good scientific practice: Scientific integrity is understood as a comprehensive ethical awareness in the sense of a culture of honesty and responsibility for quality in science. According to the Austrian Agency for Research Integrity Guidelines for Good Scientific Practice (2015), the standards of good scientific practice include, among other things, precise recordkeeping and documentation of the scientific process as well as the results to ensure that the research is reproducible. This includes the collection of primary and original data (processed raw material), in a manner that is transparent, seamlessly recorded and documented. Where they serve as the basis for publications, these data and documents (e.g. laboratory notes) are to be stored on durable, backed-up data media in the research institution where they were generated, with due attention paid to the retention periods applicable to the specific field of research wherever necessary for the purpose of ensuring the verifiability of the method selected and the findings generated. This includes ensuring that access to data is as open as possible, as restricted as necessary and, where appropriate, in accordance with the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data management principles. Reference is also made to the University of Graz document Grundsätze zur Sicherung guter wissenschaftlicher Praxis und zur Vermeidung von Fehlverhalten in der Wissenschaft [Principles for Ensuring Good Scientific Practice and Avoiding Misconduct in Science] (2004).',\n",
       " 'Guidelines and recommendations on research data management at the Friedrich Schiller University Jena\\n\\n20 december 2016\\n\\n# Preface\\n\\nAt the Friedrich Schiller University Jena (FSU) research data are regarded an essential resource for gaining scientific insights. The FSU strives to support its members with suitable research data management services. These services are provided by the central service facilities and will be continuously evaluated and enhanced.\\n\\nThe present guidelines and recommendations supplement and specify the principles formulated in the \"Policy on the handling of research data at the Friedrich Schiller University Jena\". The Research Data Management Helpdesk serves as a central point of contact for all matters relating to research data. The website of the helpdesk1 provides the most recent information.\\n\\n## I. Planning phase: before the research project\\n\\nWhile planning a research activity in which data are collected or where data form the basis of your research, it is highly recommended to examine the requirements and possibilities for efficient and sustainable research data management from early on. The Research Data Management Helpdesk is there to assist you in determining your individual requirements, find out about services and funding opportunities, and to develop a suitable strategy for your project.\\n\\nThe Service center for research and transfer2 provides general advice on proposals for third-party funding. Coordinated programs of the DFG (e.g. SFBs, research groups) are supported by the office of the Vice-President for Research3.\\n\\nIt is recommended, and also required by some funding organisations, to create and submit a data management plan (DMP). A DMP contains the requirements as well as the technical and organisational measures ensuring a sustainable handling of research data during, and after, the project life-time. Throughout a project the DMP serves as a reference and guideline. It may evolve over time if conditions or requirements change (keyword: living document).\\n\\nMost funding organisations expect not only the long-term safekeeping of research data but also its publication. A suitable strategy should be determined in the proposal phase. Costs for research data management (e.g. labour, storage, publication), which cannot be covered by the university\\'s basic facilities, should be requested in the proposal. The university computer centre assists you in determining the necessary IT infrastructure and services.\\n\\nWhile planning a research project, in particular, when publishing results, legal constraints apply and must be taken into account. Certain research data in the social sciences, life sciences and medicine, for example, are subject to strict conditions, such as privacy protection laws or require prior assessment by an ethics committee. Additionally, the protection of copyrights and legitimate interests of third parties must be ensured. It is recommended to clarify legal questions in advance while planning a research project. The legal department4 is there to advise you on these matters.\\n\\n## II. Implementation phase: during the research project\\n\\nStoring and processing, as well as collaborating on research data, should adhere to state-of-the-art IT principles. This includes, first and foremost, securing data in terms of accessibility, integrity (unaltered) and authenticity. For example, procedures for data backups and archiving need to be in place and secure data exchange platforms and versioning tools should be used.\\n\\nIn terms of research data the university computer centre (URZ)5 provides (among other things) the following services. The services are offered partly free of charge as basic infrastructure or can be provided at net cost.\\n\\nuse of network file systems (including data backup)\\nmass storage (archive storage) including data mirroring\\nrenting virtual servers (server hosting)\\naccommodation of real servers (server housing)\\nblock storage services for servers (virtual disks via a dedicated storage\\nnetwork)\\ndata exchange services\\nversioning services\\nlong-term archiving services (in cooperation with ThULB)\\n\\nDetailed service descriptions are available on the URZ website.\\n\\nThe reusability of research data is largely dependent on the availability and quality of accompanying metadata. Metadata is data about data and provides the context in which the data were created. As a rule of thumb, metadata should answer the classic six questions: Who? What? Why? How? When? Where? Metadata is a prerequisite enabling potential users to find data and assess its suitability for the intended use. Ideally, the description is structured and machine-readable. For this purpose, metadata standards and standardized terminologies exist in most disciplines. If these do not exist, generic standards, such as Dublin Core, MARC, or MODS, should be used.\\n\\nIn the implementation phase of a project, datasets may evolve over several stages (e.g. by selection, aggregation, integration). It is good practice to label, document and keep the different versions at least for the duration of the project. Especially in the case of text-based data, the use of versioning tools (e.g. git, SVN) helps with the management of different versions.\\n\\nIn collaborative projects or projects with large amounts of data, the use of dedicated software and infrastructure for data management is advisable. Operating these infrastructures usually requires additional resources, but they provide the advantage of a streamlined central management for research data. Finding and sharing research data is thereby facilitated, but should be governed by a data policy the project consortium agreed upon.\\n\\n## III. Final phase: after completion of the research project\\n\\nAccording to good scientific practice, research data must be archived and made available by the end of a project. In particular, public access has become a necessity in recent years in order to facilitate the traceability of research results as well as subsequent reuse of the data. It is recommended to publish research data following the principle \"as open as possible, as restricted as necessary\".\\n\\nThere are various ways to publish research data. In addition to domain-agnostic repositories, a large number of discipline-specific repositories exist. To find a suitable repository for your research data, the portal re3data.org 6  provides extensive search and filter capabilities. In addition, there are special data journals for publishing research data. In some disciplines it is common practice to publish data as a supplement to the respective article. However, this form of data publication has the disadvantage that the data can only be found via the article and does not form an independent, citable publication object\\n\\nWhen selecting a publication method, the following criteria should be taken into account: long-term availability (at least 10 years), allocation of persistent identifiers (e.g. DOI, URN), licensing and usage terms of the data, visibility and cost.\\n\\nAs a member of the FSU, you may publish and archive research data with the Digital Library of Thuringia (DBT)7.\\n\\nIf you published research data with an external repository, you are requested to register this publication with the Digital Library Thuringia, too.\\n\\nIndividual websites (e.g. of projects, departments, employees) are generally not suitable for the publication of research data. The long-term availability of such websites is often not guaranteed and non-ambiguous identification (keyword: PID) and cross-referencing is limited.\\n\\nWhen selecting the data to be published, the DFG (2015) recommends, \"Data should be made accessible at a stage of processing that allows it to be usefully reused by third parties (raw data or structured data).\" In particular, data that served as the foundation of a scientific article should be made public.\\n\\nAs with scientific articles, research data should also receive a unique, persistent identifier (PID). A PID (e.g. DOI, URN) is typically provided by the repository or data journal at the time of publication. In order to mandate usage and exploitation rights of your research data, data should always be published with a corresponding license. The selected license should allow at least open access for scientific purposes. Specific requirements of the funding organisation or repositories may apply and need to be considered. Suitable data licenses are available from Open Data Commons8 or the Creative Commons9. In general, research data should be published as soon as possible. However, there may be reasons to publish research data with an embargo period. In this case, the data is submitted to the repository for archiving, but it is only accessible after the end of the embargo period. The researchers who are responsible for the data determine the length of the embargo period, unless otherwise requested by the policies and guidelines of funding organisations or the repositories. Embargo periods should not exceed 1-2 years after the end of the project.\\n\\nVorstehende Handlungsempfehlung wurde am 20.

       " \"# Research Data Policy of the University of Rostock\\n\\n## Preamble\\n\\nQuality-assured research data is a cornerstone of scientific knowledge that can be used on multiple occasions as the basis for further research, irrespective of its original purpose. Sustainable storage and provision of research data therefore not only helps verify earlier results, but is also significantly important for attaining future results with the goal of improving the quality, productivity and competitiveness of science, and forms a fundamental basis for the transfer of knowledge.\\n\\nWith its Research Data Policy, the University of Rostock aims to provide its researchers principles and recommendations for planning, handling, archiving and sustainably publishing research data. The University of Rostock recognises the value of exchanging and publishing data for disseminating research work and publications.\\n\\nWhen acquiring and disseminating scientific findings and managing research data, all members of the university community at the University of Rostock and its associates observe the rules of good scientific practice1. They are required to provide the research data emanating from their research according to the rules or standards that have been established for the respective subject area.\\n\\nPursuant to the University of Rostock's Open Access Declaration2, the University recommends that the research data is made accessible to the public alongside the scientific publications.\\n\\n### Research Data\\n\\nResearch data is all data that is generated using scientific methods during a research project – this applies to newly created as well as previous data that has been adapted for use. Research Data Management (RDM) denotes all activities related to digital research data (not including their actual use), in particular their documentation, storage and long-term availability. These principles are applied to digital research data.\\n\\nThe provision of research data for further use is a service that not only benefits science, but also society as a whole. This additional effort as part of the research activities is recognised and encouraged.\\n\\n### Responsibilities\\n\\nThis policy is aimed at all members of the university community at the University of Rostock and its associates that handle research data, as well as researchers working in Rostock temporarily or as guests. They implement Research Data Management in line with the principles of this policy.\\n\\nResearch Data Management complies with the valid laws to protect individuals and intellectual property and the provisions of the statutes and the university regulations and is subject to specific research funding agreements concluded with third parties. These guidelines apply to research collaborations and research projects, as long as those involved have not stipulated any equivalent or stricter rules.\\n\\n## Handling Research Data\\n\\na. The research data is to be stored in accordance with the FAIR principles of findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability. Open access to research data is usually provided through the citable publication of data.\\n\\nb. Research data that forms the essential foundation for published findings shall be archived in a trustworthy repository, corresponding to the usual customs of the subject area, for at least ten years after the date of publication.\\nc. Research data that cannot be made available as a result of legal and contractual regulations, or due to data protection and other protective reasons, or ethical and legal aspects, will be stored by a confidential storage service that complies with the FAIR principles. A corresponding service is provided by the University of Rostock.\\nd. Access to research data can be temporarily restricted by appropriate embargo periods for a maximum of three years after the end of the project, in order to enable the prior production of corresponding scientific evaluations, publications and theses or dissertations.\\ne. The research data shall be kept securely, processed and documented (details should include the entire research cycle as well as the tools and procedures used) pursuant to established regulations or standards, and stored for the long term.\\nf. Ideally, the corresponding descriptive meta data will be linked to the research data during the research process, or the meta data will be specified in the data management plan.\\ng. It is recommended that research projects involving research data develop and submit a data management plan to the members of staff in the Strategic Research Consulting Unit (S1.1), if possible prior to the start of the research project, especially if university resources are required for Research Data Management.\\nh. The University implements and maintains a basic research data infrastructure and thus ensures appropriate storage and the technical availability of digital research data. Specific requirements must be discussed and, where necessary, financed additionally.\\n\\n### Terms of Access and Use\\n\\na. The rights to use research data are determined by contractual provisions, in particular as a result of employment contracts or through other agreements (e.g. third-party research contracts). Research data (this also includes research data that cannot be protected) must be personally marked and stored under the name of a responsible person.\\nb. The University of Rostock, its members and associates observe ethical, data protection and confidentiality requirements in all tasks related to Research Data Management.\\nc. As far as possible pursuant to the relevant research standards, personal data from individuals whose data is being collected shall be anonymised or, if it helps pseudonymised. They are to be processed and used in accordance with the valid legal regulations. A description of the procedure that is to be agreed with the Data Protection Officer forms the basis for approval pursuant to data protection regulations.\\nd. When transferring subsequent rights of use and publication rights, efforts shall be made to ensure that the data remains available for scientific purposes in accordance with the FAIR principles. An open licence (for research data: Creative Commons) is therefore recommended for simple subsequent use.\\n\\n### Fostering the Development of Competence\\n\\nThe subject-specific methods for Research Data Management shall be appropriately and sustainably anchored in teaching and further education offers, in particular in research-oriented practicals, projects and theses/dissertations.\\n\\nThe English translation of the Forschungsdaten-Policy der Universität Rostock is intended solely as a convenience to non-German-reading students/members of the university. Only the German text published in the University of Rostock’s official bulletin on 23 June 2023 is legally binding. In the event of any conflict between the English and German text, its structure, meaning or interpretation, the German text, its structure, meaning or interpretation shall prevail.\\n\\n## Expiry\\n\\nDue to research progress, the way data is handled is subject to constant change. That is why these principles are evaluated regularly and adjusted to current standards no later than 3 years after their publication3.\\n\\nDrawn up following the decision passed by the Rectorate on 19 June 2023.\\n\\nRostock, 22 June 2023\\n\\nThe Rector of the University of Rostock University Professor Dr. Elizabeth Prommer\",\n",
       " '# Research-Data-Policy of the University of Siegen\\n\\nAdopted by the Rectorate of the University of Siegen on March 30th 2017\\n\\nThe University of Siegen emphasizes the principle of the individual responsibility of its scientists for research and teaching in the age of digitalization. The respective project leaders or independent researchers are responsible for compliance with good scientific practice in dealing with digital and non-digital research data, as well as for their long-term availability and reusability, in accordance with discipline-specific standards under ethical, privacy-conscious considerations, observing copyrights, patents or matters of confidentiality.\\n\\nThe University of Siegen extends special support to them by way of:\\n\\ncreating the conditions for comprehensive, sustainable and eligible research data management;\\noffering a service and consulting center for e-science infrastructures, from the planning and application phase through to subsequent use, as a joint service of the Center for Information and Media Technology (ZIMT) and the University Library (UB);\\nreducing the administrative burden on the scientists through appropriate organizational, technical and financial measures;\\nbuilding an institutional and long-term archiving research data repository for storage, verification and reuse according to the access rights defined by the scientists;\\nestablishing, maintaining and keeping contact to specialist repositories and central research data infrastructures;\\nproviding opportunities for the publication of suitable research data in the event of publication;\\nadvising them on the use of suitable open-content and open-source licenses in the event of publication in the sense of the Open Access Policy1, securing the right to personal use of research results remains;\\nproviding patent counseling in the event that results worthy of protection emerge; entering into and providing supporting to cooperations with other scientific partners in the field of research data management.',\n",
       " '# Research data management policy of the University of Stuttgart\\n\\nIssued by the Rectorate on 25 July 2017\\n\\n## Policy statement\\n\\nThe ability to reproduce scientific findings and their applications requires that research data be managed responsibly. Capturing and accessing research data thus call for administering discipline-specific standards while also complying with applicable laws and regulations. The University of Stuttgart expects its researchers and cooperation partners to abide by and implement the following research data management protocols to enable the capture and publication of their research data.\\n\\n### Managing research data\\n\\nResearch data come about by being gathered, monitored, calculated, derived or generated during the research process. Even a proprietary piece of software qualifies as research data. Research data management spans the entire life cycle of these data: their generation, analysis, evaluation, publication and storage through to eventual reuse by third parties. Besides documenting the data, it includes specifying – and possibly storing – the equipment and software employed in producing them. Descriptive metadata should be linked to the research data even during the research process. Metadata allows drilling down to the stored research data; hence, it guarantees their reproducibility and reuse.\\n\\n### Protocols\\n\\n1. The researchers who determine within the legal framework when and under which conditions the relevant research data are to be made accessible are responsible for the research data and for complying with discipline-specific standards. The University of Stuttgart promotes and expressly supports free access to research data, provided that ethical, legal, business, and contractual framework conditions are observed.\\n\\n2. Research projects that generate data need careful data management planning and controls on access rights and restrictions, especially if the research data are to be made available to a community. Accordingly, research data management, guided by current professional standards and DFG recommendations on safeguarding good scientific practice, must be documented in a data management plan.\\n\\n3. Research data must be stored securely and appropriately documented and reviewed. In the process, the scientific and legal rights of the researchers, the privacy of personal data, other obligations to third parties (e.g.\\n\\ncooperation partners) and ethical, legal, and business constraints must be upheld. Digital research data are to be saved and stored in a suitable University of Stuttgart information infrastructure using services approved by the University.\\n\\nWith its central facilities, the University of Stuttgart supports researchers in planning, capturing, and retaining research data, in formulating and maintaining standards for handling research data, and with relevant training and consultation offerings created in cooperation with the specialized disciplines. The University of Stuttgart recommends and supports embedding a focus on the importance of discipline-specific, organized research date management in curriculum delivery by the respective faculties.',\n",
       " \"# University policy framework for research data Utrecht University\\n\\n## 1. Structure of this policy framework\\n\\nThis policy framework begins with a definition of research data (section 2). Section 3 looks at the objectives and scope of the framework; specifically, what is this policy framework intended to accomplish and what does fall outside the framework?\\n\\nSection 4 provides an overview of the current rules and regulations on which the framework is based and also describes the general criteria for effective research data management. Section 5 describes the diverse roles involved in research data management and distinguishes their respective responsibilities. Section 6 establishes the period of validity of the framework.\\n\\n## 2. Definitions\\n\\nData are recorded facts or circumstances.\\n\\nResearch data constitute\\n\\nprimary research data: the raw, rough measurements or observations Secondary research data: the results after the data have been processed by a researcher (recoded, combined, categorised, visualised, etc.)\\n\\nExternal research data: research data made available to Utrecht University and having received, for this use, licensed access to use as a source -  but the rights are kept fully outside Utrecht University (such as statistical, financial or survey data).\\n\\nArchivable research data constitute all research data, excluding external research data, deemed relevant to preserve after the research is completed, for example in connection with the verifiability of the research and/or for possible reuse.\\n\\nThis policy framework applies to all research data.\\n\\nResearch data are intrinsically linked to\\n\\nresearch objects (e.g. geological material, blood samples, archival documents)\\ndocumentation of the research process (e.g. in lab (note-) books)\\nresearch results; all inventions, outcomes, materials, methods, processes, products (e.g. publications), programmes, software, findings and/or discoveries generated within the context of a research project\\n\\n## 3. Aims and scope\\n\\n### Aim of this policy framework\\n\\nResearchers at Utrecht University are supposed to be cognisant of the requirements that the university applies to working with research data. This policy is intended to set parameters to safeguard the quality, availability and accessibility of research data within Utrecht University and also to provide a basis for evaluating compliance with laws, regulations and codes of conduct.\\nThe policy clearly delineates responsibilities in terms of the roles to be fulfilled by various parties (Executive Board, faculty boards, support and technical staff, research leaders and individual researchers).\\n\\n### Limits\\n\\nFaculties/research institutes are in charge of the research objects, for which the policy framework makes no provisions.\\nThis policy framework does not define a testing procedure.\\nThe purpose of this policy is not to obligate researchers to work with prescribed tools when preserving and releasing research data. The spectrum of UU research is too diverse to impose general guidelines.\\n\\n## 4. Basic premises and principles\\n\\nThis policy framework is premised on existing frameworks, which include (but are not limited to):\\n\\nthe Dutch Personal Data Protection Act the Dutch Copyright Act and the Patents Act • Medical-ethical research protocol requirements pursuant to the Dutch Medical Research (Human Subjects) Act (WMO), as evaluated by the Medical Research Ethics Committee (METC) Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities Code of Conduct of the Association of Universities in the Netherlands (VSNU) Utrecht University's information security policy and ground rules\\n\\nIn addition to the above, Utrecht University applies the following specific principles to data management.\\n\\n### Creation and collection\\n\\nResearch data must be collected, registered, selected and made available for use in accordance with the applicable international standards.\\n\\n### Storage, management and retention\\n\\nAll research data are to be managed in accordance with the university's requirements\\ngoverning information security, privacy protection and transparency, in this order of\\nimportance.\\nArchived research data are to be retained for a minimum of ten years, commencing from the date that the research results are published.\\nThe data are to be stored safely, protected from unauthorised use and loss.\\nThe party or parties holding the rights to the data and the parties entitled to use the data are clearly and visibly documented.\\nArchived research data are to be stored in a structure that is suitable for long-term preservation and later consultation.\\nThe full set of research data connected with a research project are to be retained upon its conclusion insofar as relevant for the verifiability of the research.\\nThe research data will be provided with metadata to describe the data with sufficient clarity to ensure they are findable for further research.\\nThe retention period and contact details of the data manager are clearly and visibly\\ndocumented. If research data are to be destroyed, this has to be done in a manner that is verifiable and is irrevocable.\\n\\n### Findability and access\\n\\nDigital research should be easy and quick to find\\n\\nAccess needs to be furnished in a user-friendly as possible environment in a manner that duly credits and also protects the rights of those who collected or created the data and also protects the rights of those have a legal interest in the manner in which the data are made accessible and used. Archived research data are to be made available for access and reuse at and outside Utrecht University insofar as is reasonably possible and subject to the proper precautionary measures. Exclusive rights to reuse or publish research data are not to be transferred to commercial publishers or their representatives without retention of the right to provide open access to the data for the purpose of reuse, except where such transfer is a condition for awarding funds.\\n\\n## 5. Roles and responsibilities\\n\\nUtrecht University distinguishes between the following individual or (groups of) actors, each bearing specific responsibilities for data management.\\n\\n1. The creators of the data: researchers and students and their supervisors have primary responsibility for data care.\\n2. Research institute directors are responsible for ensuring that students, researchers and research leaders at their institute abide by the university policy framework and any supplementary faculty regulations. They may also establish further guidelines as needed.\\n3. Deans draw up additional faculty guidelines pursuant to the university policy framework and are responsible for ensuring that research institute directors implement both the university policy framework and the faculty guidelines.\\n4. The Executive Board is responsible for the preparation of a general university policy framework, and for monitoring and facilitating its implementation through the provision of infrastructure, information and other forms of support.\\n\\nA further general guiding principle is that each and every staff member must act as a good steward in the management of relevant data.\\n\\n### 1. Researchers\\n\\nIt is the responsibility of each individual researcher (or, in the case of a group of researchers, the research leader) to draw up a Data Management Plan (DMP) at the start of the research project and to follow up the agreements made in this plan. The DMP specifies the manner in which research data may be collected, stored, preserved, managed, documented and used. A sample DMP template is available on the Utrecht University intranet.\\n\\nMore specifically,\\n\\nResearchers are obliged to:\\n\\ndraw up proper procedures and design processes for the collection, storage, use, reuse, availability and long-term archiving of and provision of access to research data within the research programme. In the case of external data, agreements must be made with the provider of the external data;\\nif participating in a joint study or research project to make and record the made agreements on data management;\\nensure that the integrity, confidentiality and protection of the data are guaranteed;\\nwhere the data fall under the Dutch Personal Data Protection Act or under the European Data Protection Guideline, to be aware of their obligations and possible statutory liability;\\nmake arrangements for the continued operational management of the research data at the end of the research project or termination of their employment contract at the institution;\\nfactor in the costs for the preservation and management of the research data in research proposals and grant applications.\\n\\n### 2. Lecturers and student/PhD supervisors\\n\\nIt is crucial that young researchers (students and PhD candidates) develop an awareness of the importance of good data management and learn about the various options that the institution offers for this purpose. Their supervisors play a key role in developing this awareness. This means that lecturers and those supervising students and PhD candidates are responsible for acquainting their students or PhDs with the university frameworks and disciplinary guidelines governing the collection, storage, preservation, protection and use of data. They must further monitor that students and PhD candidates follow these frameworks and guidelines when conducting their research. It is the joint responsibility of students/PhD candidates and their supervisors to make and record proper agreements on data management and use.\\n\\n### 3. Students/PhD candidates\\n\\nStudents are expected to familiarise themselves with the university and faculty policy frameworks and other guidelines applicable to their research and for collecting, storing, preserving, securing and using data in accordance with those frameworks and guidelines.\\n4. Faculty research institute directors\\n\\nFaculty research institute directors are responsible for ensuring meticulous research, which also includes conscientious data management. They must ensure that staff and students are aware of their responsibilities and obligations in regard to data management and provide education and training to address any gaps in data management knowledge and skills.\\n\\nMore specifically,\\n\\n### Faculty research institute directors must:\\n\\nauthorise the procedures that their researchers, students and PhD candidates follow for the collection, storage, use, reuse and (if necessary) deletion of research data;\\nensure that researchers are aware of all their responsibilities and obligations in relation to the research data they collect in the course of their research and that they are sufficiently equipped to fulfil these responsibilities and obligations;\\ndetermine additional guidelines for the storage and long-term preservation of research data at their institute, if desired, which are consistent with guidelines of the faculty, the university policy framework and statutory requirements, and ensure compliance with these additional guidelines.\\n\\n## 5. Deans\\n\\nFaculty deans are responsible for the implementation and monitoring of the university policy framework and for drawing up additional faculty guidelines to this end if needed; Deans are responsible for the meticulous handling and management of data within their respective faculties, in conformity with all statutory and other applicable requirements.\\n\\n6. The Executive Board\\n\\nThe Executive Board is responsible for the preparation and adoption of a university policy framework governing research data (in the form of the Utrecht University Research Data Policy);\\nThe Executive Board is responsible for maintaining and updating the research data policy framework;\\nThe Executive Board supervises the implementation of the university research data policy framework;\\nThe Executive Board makes provisions for institutional education, training, support, advisement and, where necessary, the development of guidelines and templates, in any case including a Data Management Plan template;\\nThe Executive Board ensures that the institution has facilities and services enabling the secure storage of research data for current and future use. This includes storage, backup, registration, repository and long-term preservation services for datasets and the infrastructure needed to provide access to research data and share it with third parties.\\n\\n## 2. Period of validity of the policy framework\\n\\nThis policy framework takes effect on 1 January 2016 and is valid until a new version is issued.\\n\\nDisclaimer:  This document contains an unofficial translation into the English language.

       " \"# Prifysgol Wrecsam Wrexham University\\n\\n# Research Data Management Policy 2024\\n\\nApproved 11th July 2024, Academic Board: 23.116.5\\n\\n## Contents\\n\\nIntroduction\\nPurpose…\\nScope 2\\nDefinitions. 3\\nPrinciples . 3\\nCollection. 3\\nOwnership. 3\\nOrganisation and Technical Measures 3\\nData Management Plans and Data Protection Impact Assessments 3\\nStorage . 5\\nData Sharing. 5\\nTransferring Data Outside the EU 6\\nRetention . 6\\nDisposal.. 7\\nAccess .. 7\\nFAIR Data. 7\\nReporting a Data Incident/Breach. 8\\nOther Polices, Procedures, Legislation. . 8\\nWrexham University Policy and Procedure . 8\\nLegislation... 8\\n\\n# Prifysgol Wrecsam Wrexham University\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nWrexham University is committed to maintaining the highest standards of ethics, rigour, and integrity in all its research. It seeks to protect the dignity, rights, and welfare of all those involved in the research it produces. The University recognises its duty to safeguard the confidentiality of personal research data in keeping with its responsibilities under the Data Protection Act 2018 and the General Data Protection Regulation 2018 (UK GDPR). This legislation defines the University's responsibility to ensure appropriate organisational and technical measures are in place to protect personal data.\\n\\nAny research project collecting data from a human participant or collecting or processing personal data must have formal ethical approval from the University and comply with the University's Data Protection and Data Disposal Policy.\\n\\nThe University recognises research data as a valued asset. It identifies the maintenance of accurate and retrievable data from the research community as best practice, acknowledging that sharing research data is crucial to the impact, visibility, transparency, trust, and knowledge transfer of the University's research.\\n\\nWrexham University supports the UKRI Common Principles on Research Data, acknowledging that publicly funded research data are a public good, produced in the public interest for societal benefit and, where possible, be made openly available with a few restrictions as possible in a timely and responsible manner.\\n\\n## Purpose\\n\\nThis Policy sets out the principles that should be followed by staff and students at Wrexham University when processing research data throughout the research lifecycle. The Policy promotes good practice in research data management, fostering responsibility for preparing Research Data Plans and ensuring research data is stored, retained, accessed, and disposed of securely, complying with legal and ethical obligations, University policy and, where applicable, the requirements of funding bodies.\\n\\nThe Policy defines the individual and institutional responsibilities that the individual and institutional levels that should guide the work of those involved in research data collection, curation, storage, and maintenance. It sets out the basis on which University staff and students will process any personal data collected from data subjects in the course of conducting research or that is provided to those conducting research by data subjects or other sources for the same.\\n\\n## Scope\\n\\nThis Policy applies to all staff and students at Wrexham University engaged in research, whether or not the research is funded and whether or not the data collected includes collecting or processing personal data. The Policy covers all data collected during a research study and all members of the University involved in the creation, collection, and curation of research data under the auspices of the University, including sessional, visiting or emeritus, associates, honorary, contractors, consultants, or volunteers.\\n\\n# Prifysgol Wrecsam Wrexham University\\n\\n## Definitions\\n\\nFor the purpose of this Policy, research data are defined as that which is collected, observed, or created for the purpose of analysing and producing original research results. Such research data are the recorded information, regardless of the form or the media in which they may exist, necessary to support or validate a research project's observations, findings or outputs. In practice, the nature of research data can vary widely depending on the discipline. It can be textual, numerical, qualitative, quantitative, final, preliminary, physical, digital or print. Research data comes in many formats, including word-processed documents, PDFs, spreadsheets, scanned lab books, online surveys, digital recordings, databases or computer software.\\n\\n## Principles\\n\\n### Collection\\n\\nResearch data must be collected responsibly, using the correct methods and techniques to protect the integrity of your data.  Research data must be collected in accordance with the ethical approval of a research project and the legal obligations of the Data Protection Act 2018.\\n\\n### Ownership\\n\\nFor research carried out under a grant or contract or involving collaboration with another institution or external party, the agreement's terms will determine the data's ownership and rights. It is recommended that any contract with an external party identify the process for Research Data Management in conjunction with the principles of this Policy.\\n\\nWhere no external contract and no intellectual property rights exist, the University owns the data generated during research undertaken under the auspices of the University by staff members in its employment and postgraduate research students. Where taught students generate data under the supervision of a staff member as part of a funded project the data will be owned by the University or in accordance with the terms of the contract.\\n\\n### Organisation and Technical Measures\\n\\nThe University Research Ethics Policy sets out the ethical review and approval process to ensure that the University research is carried out in the public interest and is lawful under the UK GDPR and Data Protection Act. All staff and students conducting research within the scope of the Research Ethics Policy must seek ethical approval before data collection and processing commence.\\n\\nData Management Plans and Data Protection Impact Assessments\\n\\nData Management Plans (DMP) should be completed before the commencement of all research projects. The DMP should address the type, volume, storage, confidentiality, retention, sharing, deposit, reuse, and integrity of the data throughout the project lifecycle. The Principal Investigator or Supervisor is responsible for creating and owning\\n\\n# Prifysgol Wrecsam Wrexham University\\n\\na research data management plan and ensuring the full research team and collaborators are aware of and adhere to it.\\n\\nMany funders require researchers to submit a data management plan as part of the application process. Researchers should respect the data management policies of the funder(s) and other external parties. Many public funders of research, including all the UK Research Councils, accept that the management of research data is a legitimate research expense.\\n\\nResearch projects requiring ethical approval should use the data management plan provided in the online ethical approval application form. Projects not requiring ethical approval should complete the Wrexham University Data Management Plan Template. When preparing an application, researchers applying for funding should consider the terms and requirements listed in the funder policy documents. Researchers can access DMPOnline to view the data management plan templates based on the requirements listed in the funder policy documents.\\n\\nThe UK GDPR creates a legal obligation to think about and mitigate data protection issues and privacy concerns at the project planning stage before any data is gathered. A Date Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) is an assessment to help researchers identify any potential risks a project might have as regards intruding into participants' privacy. The DPIA then assists with implementing appropriate measures and controls to minimise and manage those risks. The legislation has made DPIAs mandatory for higher-risk data processing to ensure that privacy and data protection are key considerations from the start of any project and then taken into account throughout the project's lifecycle.\\n\\nThe European Commission (DG Research and Innovation) recommends that a DPIA be carried out for data processing operations that may entail higher ethical risks, such as:\\n\\n<html><body><table><tr><td>TypesofPersonal Data</td><td>Racial or ethnic origin Political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs Genetic, biometric or health data Sex Life or sexual orientation Trade Union membership</td></tr><tr><td>Data Subjects</td><td>Children Vulnerable people People who have not given their explicit consent to participate in the project</td></tr><tr><td>Scale or complexity of data Processing</td><td>Large scale processing of personal data Systematic monitoring of a publicly accessible area on alarge scale Involvementofmultipledatasetsand/orservice providers orthecombination and analysisofdifferent datasets (big data)</td></tr><tr><td>Data-collection or processing Techniques</td><td>Privacy-invasive methods ortechnologies (the covert observation, surveillance, tracking or deception of individuals) Using camera systems to monitor behaviour or record sensitive information.</td></tr></table></body></html>\\n\\n# Prifysgol Wrecsam Wrexham University\\n\\n<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Data mining (including data collected from social media networks)web crawling orsocial network analysis. Profiling individuals or groups (particular behavioural or psychological profiling) Using artificial intelligence to analyse personal data Using automated decision-making that has a significant impact on the data subject(s)</td></tr><tr><td>InvolvementofnonEU- countries</td><td>Transferofpersonaldatatonon-EUcountries CollectionofpersonaldataoutsidetheEU</td></tr></table></body></html>\\n\\nA DPIA screening is included in the Research Ethics Committee approval process. However, some funders will require a separate DPIA, which should be completed using the University Data Protection Impact Assessment Template or one provided by the funder if that is specified. In cases where a research project does not require ethical review, researchers must still complete a DPIA screening and, if necessary, a full assessment, which must be authorised by the Data Protection Officer.\\n\\nThe University mandates that a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) is completed prior to the commencement of a research project that is likely to result in high risk to individuals. The DPIA process is a legal requirement and an important tool to help you identify and minimise the data protection risks of a project involving personal data processing. Researchers should refer to the ICO for further information on the definition of high-risk data processing and the Wrexham University Data Protection Impact Assessment template and guidance document.\\n\\n## Storage\\n\\nAll research data must be stored in a university-managed environment throughout the project's lifecycle. A university approved environment protects research data against a data breach, data loss and corruption, and unauthorised access and guarantees the security and integrity of research data and participant information. The University recommends that research data collected by staff or students be stored on the University's private drive (Z drive), shared drive (Y drive), or cloud-based University (Teams and OneDrive). Physical research data should be stored on the University premises in a secure environment at all times. Researcher working remotely should refer to the principles and guidance outlined in the University Remote and Mobile Working Policy\\n\\n## Data Sharing\\n\\nWhere proposed research projects involve collaboration with third parties (e.g another university, NHS Trust or other external partners) and the sharing of personal data, special category data, criminal convictions or offences data or pseudonymised data is anticipated, an appropriate contract or data sharing agreement must be put in place before any data is exchanged.\\n\\n# Prifysgol Wrecsam Wrexham University\\n\\nData Sharing Agreements set out the framework for the sharing of personal data and documents, the purpose of the sharing, covers what happens to the data at each stage and puts in place standards that help all the parties involved in the sharing to be clear about their roles and responsibilities.\\n\\nA ‘Data Sharing Agreement' is required where the University and the other party are both Data Controllers or Joint Controllers and intend on sharing personal information routinely and regularly between themselves.\\nA 'Data Processing Agreement' is required when the University is the data controller and contracts an outside company to undertake a task that involves the processing of personal data on its behalf.\\n\\nTransferring Data Outside the EU\\n\\nThe UK GDPR does not allow the transfer of personal data outside the EU or a country without adequate protection without meeting a condition like explicit consent or a binding contract. Researchers must always, therefore, obtain explicit consent or anonymise data before sending data outside the European Economic Area (the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein). Some countries listed by the EU have received adequacy decisions (as of January 2021, these are Andorra, Argentina, Canada, Faroe Islands, Guernsey, Israel, Isle of Man, Japan, Jersey, New Zealand, Republic of Korea, Switzerland, United Kingdom, Uruguay but the list may change with time).\\n\\nThe UK is currently considered adequate for data protection purposes until 2025. In all cases, researchers should use password protection or encryption where possible in transit, but bear in mind that some countries will require the use of encryption keys if personal data are transferred to them.\\n\\n## Retention\\n\\nFunded research projects must comply with any retention periods specified by the funder requirements. Where a funder does not specify a retention period or a project is unfunded, research data generated by a member staff should be held for a minimum of 10 years from the point of collecting, creating, or generating the research data, where appropriate to do so. The University requires that data directly underpinning any published findings is stored for a minimum of this time frame to support or validate a research project's observations, findings, or outputs.\\n\\nResearch data collected by Wrexham University students should be retained up to the point of the assessment period. Research data collected by students at the University to support a potential publication in the future should be retained for 10 years. It is the supervisor's responsibility to ensure any personal research data collected by students has been deleted and that any retained data is stored appropriately.\\n\\nWhere appropriate, research data must be offered and assessed for deposit and retention in a national or international data service or subject repository.\\n\\n# Prifysgol Wrecsam Wrexham University\\n\\nIndividual Research Councils' and other funders' data policies and good research practice guidance provide additional requirements and should be consulted, as well as retention periods specified in each Research Data Management Plan. In many instances, researchers will resolve to retain research data and records for a longer period than the minimum requirement. Researchers should note that personal data can be kept in non-anonymised form for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed.\\n\\n## Disposal\\n\\nThe disposal and destruction of research data must be undertaken in accordance with the University's Data Protection and Data Disposal Policy. The agreed data disposal time and process should be included in the Data Management Plan and any participant-facing documents. If data have been shared with partners or transferred to third parties in the course of the project, researchers should ensure that they have deleted them unless they have a legitimate basis for retaining them.\\n\\n## Access\\n\\nWrexham University recognises the benefits of making Research Data accessible to the public and broader academic community.\\n\\nAccess to research data during the course of a research project should be restricted to the collaborators of the research project or provided access when the correct data-sharing approvals are in place.\\n\\nAccess to research data after a research project has finished should be considered in relation to the ownership, ethical, confidential, sensitive, commercial, legal, regulatory or funding restrictions. Research Data produced by Wrexham University staff should be openly available with as few restrictions as possible where appropriate. Personal research data may be made available if it is in an anonymised form and where there is informed consent for it to be shared.\\n\\nThe University recommends that data sets are assigned a persistent identifier, such as a Digital Object Identifier (DOI). The use of ORCID (Open Researcher and Contributor ID), as well as the use of standard open licences for sharing research data is also recommended. Authors of restricted data sets should also consider their deposit in a trusted repository to aid discovery, meet funder requirements and ensure the data remains available to fulfil legitimate access requests.\\n\\n## FAIR Data\\n\\nWhere it is lawful to do so, the University supports the broad global consensus that publicly funded research data should be made openly available as soon as possible with as few restrictions as necessary. Additionally, many UK and international funders have embraced FAIR principles for data sharing, making data.\\n\\nFindable Accessible Interoperable Reusable\\n\\nUK Research and Innovation (UKRI) for example have agreed a set of common principles for research data policies, which are based on the expectations that:\\n\\n# Prifysgol Wrecsam Wrexham University\\n\\nPublicly funded research data are a public good and produced in the public interest.\\nDatra that has acknowledged long-term value should be preserved to remain accessible and usable for future research.\\nPublished results should always include information about how to access the supporting data.\\nSuch research data should be made openly available with as few restrictions as possible in a timely and responsible manner.\\n\\n## Reporting a Data Incident/Breach\\n\\nThe UK GDPR requires Data Controllers to notify any Personal Data Breach to the Information Commissioner and, in certain instances, the Data Subject. The University has put in place procedures to deal with any suspected Personal Data Breach and will notify Data Subjects and/or the Information Commissioner where we are legally required to do so. All breaches should be reported immediately to the Data Protection Officer. Researchers should preserve all evidence relating to the potential Personal Data Incident/Breach to enable the DPO to carry out an investigation. All research data incident, breach or loss must also be reported to the Research Office.\\n\\n## Other Polices, Procedures, Legislation\\n\\nThis Policy should be read with reference to the below.\\n\\nWrexham University Policy and Procedure\\n\\nData Protection and Data Disposal Policy\\nInformation Security Policy\\nData Security Policy for Portable Electronic Devices\\nPrivacy Impact Assessment Policy\\nMobile and Remote Working Policy\\nRecords Management Policy\\n\\n### Legislation\\n\\nData Protection Act 2018 UK GDPR Freedom of Information Act 2000\"]"
