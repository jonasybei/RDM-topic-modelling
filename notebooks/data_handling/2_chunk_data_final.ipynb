All plans should address data capture, documentation and metadata, ethical and legal compliance, storage and backup, and selection of data for long term storage. DMP Online provides an online tool to support the creation of Data Management Plans.   \n",
      "Deposit their data in an appropriate data repository and provide sufficient information (such as a metadata record) to ensure that it can be found, understood, and cited. Where data is deposited somewhere other than BNU’s institutional repository (BNU Knowledge Archive), a metadata record should also be created in the BNU repository which describes and points to the data. External repositories, where used, should support the use of Open Researcher and Contributor IDs (ORCIDs) and Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs).   \n",
      "Share data in accordance with the principles of open access (see BNU’s Open Access Policy).   \n",
      "Where possible, researchers should seek to recover any cost associated with research data management from the funding body.  \n",
      "\n",
      "14 All research data must be registered with the University whether it is hosted by the University or retained elsewhere. Researchers are responsible for informing the Research and Enterprise Directorate of the location of the data and who will have access to it. BNU retains the right to store a copy of the data for an acceptable period to ensure regulatory or contractual compliance. Guidance on how to register data with BNU, is available on the Research Data Management pages of the staff intranet.  \n",
      "\n",
