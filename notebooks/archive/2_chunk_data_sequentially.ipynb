       " '2. Accessibility  \\n\\nResearch data and the necessary software to access the data shall be easily accessible, along with other necessary information to access the data, such as a mention of the concerned research areas.  \\n\\nAn embargo period can be agreed upon, to achieve strategic advantage for the creator. The embargo period is expressed in connection with the material.  \\n\\nFor the research data, a licensing framework has been selected for research and educational use and for commercial exploitation. The license recommended for research data is Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) and the waiver recommended for metadata is CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication. The license recommended for software is the MIT Licence. Other licenses may be chosen to achieve the strategic goals of the research project. If research data is published using the CC BY 4.0 license, Aalto University and researchers obtain sufficient rights for the re-use of the data, even though the ownership of the research data is not transferred to the University. The terms of the CC BY 4.0 license require that the creators of the research data are attributed.',\n",
       " '3. Assessability and intelligibility  \\n\\nThe research data and the necessary software to access the data shall be assessable for and intelligible to third parties for scientific scrutiny and peer review. Research data shall be published together with related scientific publications for the purposes of peer review. Research data shall be provided in a way that judgements can be made about its reliability and the competence of those who created it.',\n",
       " '4. Usability  \\n\\nThe research data and the necessary software to access the data shall also be usable for purposes beyond the original project. The research data chosen for long-term preservation shall be safely stored and curated to ensure its usability for wider needs than merely a highly specialised expert group. Whenever possible, certified repositories are used for research data preservation.  \\n\\nResearch data shall be stored together with the minimum metadata and documentation to make it useful. Aalto University does not require the creator of the research data to offer support for further use of the data.  \\n\\nWhen applicable and allowed by previous licenses, the necessary software will also be stored together with the research data.',\n",
       " '5. Interoperability  \\n\\nThe research data and the necessary software shall be produced in a manner that ensures their interoperability with applicable standards and special quality requirements. Interoperability shall be implemented in a way that allows data exchange between researcher groups, higher education institutions and research institutions in different countries. Interoperability will also allow for the re-combination of different datasets from different origins.',\n",

       " '# 2. Accessibility  \\n\\nResearch data and the necessary software to access the data shall be easily accessible, along with other necessary information to access the data, such as a mention of the concerned research areas.  \\n\\nAn embargo period can be agreed upon, to achieve strategic advantage for the creator. The embargo period is expressed in connection with the material.  \\n\\nFor the research data, a licensing framework has been selected for research and educational use and for commercial exploitation. The license recommended for research data is Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) and the waiver recommended for metadata is CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication. The license recommended for software is the MIT Licence. Other licenses may be chosen to achieve the strategic goals of the research project. If research data is published using the CC BY 4.0 license, Aalto University and researchers obtain sufficient rights for the re-use of the data, even though the ownership of the research data is not transferred to the University. The terms of the CC BY 4.0 license require that the creators of the research data are attributed.',\n",
       " '# 3. Assessability and intelligibility  \\n\\nThe research data and the necessary software to access the data shall be assessable for and intelligible to third parties for scientific scrutiny and peer review. Research data shall be published together with related scientific publications for the purposes of peer review. Research data shall be provided in a way that judgements can be made about its reliability and the competence of those who created it.',\n",
       " '# 4. Usability  \\n\\nThe research data and the necessary software to access the data shall also be usable for purposes beyond the original project. The research data chosen for long-term preservation shall be safely stored and curated to ensure its usability for wider needs than merely a highly specialised expert group. Whenever possible, certified repositories are used for research data preservation.  \\n\\nResearch data shall be stored together with the minimum metadata and documentation to make it useful. Aalto University does not require the creator of the research data to offer support for further use of the data.  \\n\\nWhen applicable and allowed by previous licenses, the necessary software will also be stored together with the research data.',\n",
       " '# 5. Interoperability  \\n\\nThe research data and the necessary software shall be produced in a manner that ensures their interoperability with applicable standards and special quality requirements. Interoperability shall be implemented in a way that allows data exchange between researcher groups, higher education institutions and research institutions in different countries. Interoperability will also allow for the re-combination of different datasets from different origins.',\n",

      "The Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association (MDC)and other Health Centers of the Helmholtz Gemeinschaft recognize the fundamental importance of research data and its management in maintaining research excellence and scientific integrity, and are committed to pursuing the highest standards of research practice. Increased developments in computational advances,internationalization and data protection regulations present significant new opportunities and challenges in this regard.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The purpose of this policy is to provide a framework that defines the responsibilities of the MDCmanagement and its researchers, and to provide guidance for the proper management of research data throughout its full life cycle.This includes promoting data sharing and re-use to the widest extent feasible, in order to maximize research transparency, quality and impact.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The MDC is committed to a goal of making data created as part of the research process compliant with the FAIR principles[1] .Data should be: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable. Implementation of this policy also aims to ensure conformity with pertinent legal obligations, ethical responsibilities and the rules of funding bodies, including the:  \n",

      "\n",
      "This policy was developed based on consensus discussion among working group members from the Helmholtz Health Centers, and was approved by the MDC board of directorates on 01.03.2021.It applies to all researchers active at the MDC. In cases when research is funded by a third party, any agreements made with that party concerning intellectual property rights,access rights and the storage of research data take precedence over this policy.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### 2.Intellectual property rights  \n",
      "\n",
      "Intellectual property rights and ownership determine the basic conditions for use and sharing of research data. The MDC technology transfer office serves as the first point of contact regarding Intellectural Property Rights (IPR) questions about research data/results and initiates suitable protection measures where appropriate.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### 3.Handling research data  \n",
      "\n",
      "Researchers are strongly encouraged to develop a written Data Management Plan (DMP) at the design stage of each project, even when not specifically required with the assistance and support of the Research Data Management unit.  \n",
      "\n",
      "#### Data storage  \n",
      "\n",
      "Research data must be stored in a correct, complete, unadulterated and reliable manner in order to preserve its integrity.Furthermore, data must be identifiable (including through use of persistent identifiers), accessible,traceable, interoperable and, whenever possible,available for subsequent use. All research data generated and elaborated at the MDC must be stored at the MDc, in the institutional storage systems, with secure backup storage.Data may be also archived/shared in reliable trusted external repositories, in addition to the institutional storage,under written agreement.Incoming data from other institutions or repositories to be stored at the MDC must be accompanied by appropriate written agreements in consultation with the Legal department and the Data Protection Office.Storage infrastructures should be compliant with best practices in the field as well as technical specifications per legal requirements.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Where research involves the collection, processing and/or use of identifiable personal data, the storage and sharing of the data must comply with relevant ethical, legal,disciplinary and regulatory requirements and be in line with the consent under which the data was collected or provided.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Research data and related material should be retained for a minimum of ten years after acquisition or generation based on the recommendation of the DFG (in English [10], German [11]).Longer or shorter retention periods prevail in accordance to legal regulations, funders' and other contractual requirements (e.g. clinical trials, patents).  \n",
      "\n",
      "#### Data access and re-use  \n",
      "\n",
      "The MDC supports access to research data following the European Commission for Open Data principle [12], \"as open as possible,as closed as necessary.This includes not only the data/dataset itself, but also elements such as metadata, methods, protocols and software/code needed to support effective data use.The use of open-source software/code to support analysis is strongly encouraged in-line with European Open Science guidelines [13] and recommendations.  \n",
      "\n",
      "When licensing is indicated to allow data sharing and re-use, the data should be made available under an open license, unless legal obligations, third party rights, intellectual property rights and privacy rights preclude this (e.g.Creative Commons [14] and licenses approved by the Open Source Initiative [15]).  \n",
      "\n",
      "In publications and any other presentations of data,the data sources (original and subsequently-used) must be acknowledged and traceable in accordance with the MDC publication policy, see table Related Documents.  \n",
      "\n",
      "#### Deletion of data  \n",
      "\n",
      "Deletion or destruction of research data and records,either after expiration of the retention period or for legal or ethical reasons, has to be carried out considering contractual obligations of third-party funders and other stakeholders, including collaboration partners.Such actions should be documented and be accessible for future audit. Backup data copies should also be deleted.Automated deletion of research data is to be avoided. Plans outlining data deletion and destruction should be documented and agreed upon between the principal investigators or data producers with the IT department; see section 5 for more details on roles and responsibilities.  \n",

      "### 1 Preamble  \n",
      "\n",
      "The Medical University of Vienna (MedUni Vienna) recognizes the fundamental importance of the management of research data and their accompanying records for high quality research and scientific integrity, and strives to promote the highest standards in this regard in accordance with the FAIR principles. Research data that are accurate and easily retrievable are the foundation and a fundamental component of any research activity. They are essential for reviewing and defending the research process and the research result, as well as for reuse of the data.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Research data must be handled exclusively in accordance with the applicable national and international legal provisions.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### 2 Scope of Application  \n",
      "\n",
      "This policy for the management of research data refers to the collection, processing, utilization, storage and reuse of research data and applies to all persons working at MedUni Vienna (e.g. researchers, employees, students and visiting researchers). If the specific research activity is promoted, financed or sponsored by a third party and the underlying contract contains special provisions regarding the research data, the provisions of the specific contract shall take precedence over the provisions of this Policy.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### 3 Rights of Use  \n",
      "\n",
      "Unless otherwise agreed in writing, MedUni Vienna shall be entitled to the scientific and commercial use of data collected and processed in the course of research activities. This shall not affect patent rights or other rights (of disposal). The authors or inventors retain the legally reserved right to be named, the right to service inventor remuneration, the right of university members to independent publication of scientific work as well as the right to be named as co-author in the publication of research results.  \n",
      "\n",
      "If the primary right to use the data is contractually granted to a legal entity other than MedUni Vienna (e.g. in the case of contract research agreements), it must be ensured that MedUni Vienna is in any case granted those rights of disposal over the data that are necessary to fulfill its obligation of storing the data. Furthermore, it must be ensured that MedUni Vienna is granted the right to use the results generated in the course of the research activity for non-commercial research and teaching.  \n",
      "\n",
      "In order to comply with data protection, the transfer of personal data to third parties is only permitted with the consent of the MedUni Vienna's Data Clearing House and in compliance with contractual agreements in compliance with the law. The personal data to be reviewed by the Data Clearing House also include genetic and biometric data as well as data derived from biological material. Furthermore, the Data Clearing House reviews data that has already been anonymized or pseudonymized before it may be passed on to third parties.  \n",
      "\n",
      "If required by the funding body, research data must be provided with a free license and made openly available for reuse, unless third-party rights, legal obligations or rights of disposal require otherwise.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### 4 Handling of Research Data  \n",
      "\n",
      "#### 4.1 General Principles  \n",
      "\n",
      "Research data must be maintained in an accurate, complete, unaltered and reliable manner. Furthermore, identifiability, retrievability, availability and, wherever possible, reusability and interoperability must be ensured. If possible, the data must be provided with persistent identifiers.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Records must be kept of the methodology used to obtain the data, its processing (such as corrections, calculations, transformations, statistical analyses), and quality control methods.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The retention period for research data and records shall be at least ten years either from the publication of the research results or from the completion of the relevant research activity, unless provided otherwise by law. Justified deviations may result from legal provisions (e.g. patent law), requirements of third-party funding bodies or guidelines of the Rectorate.  \n",
      "\n",
      "If research data and records are deleted or destroyed, this must be done in accordance with all legal and internal university requirements and under the aspect of traceability. The interests of other involved parties (e.g. funding bodies) as well as aspects of confidentiality and security must be taken into account.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Research data must be made accessible within the MedUni Vienna's area of disposition. If required by third parties (e.g. funding bodies or journal editors), research data must be stored and made accessible in a suitable repository, taking into account data protection. The use of an external repository must be reported to MedUni Vienna by means of a data management plan (DMP).  \n",
      "\n",
      "Persons working at MedUni Vienna (e.g. researchers, staff and students) and other authorized persons (e.g. institutions funding research; authorities) must have access to the original data in order to be able to answer questions that may arise (e.g. for validation, reproducibility and quality assurance).  \n",
      "\n",
      "#### 4.2 Handling of Personal Data  \n",
      "\n",
      "Personal data are also processed in the course of research activities at MedUni Vienna (e.g. data of patients, test persons and employees). Personal data are specially protected by data protection regulations. They must therefore be properly processed and used with due care in accordance with the legal provisions. When dealing with health data, the increased requirements of data protection must be met.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The Austrian Data Protection Act (Dsg) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDpR) must be obeyed at all times. This applies to the processing of electronic data as well as to information that is not processed automatically (e.g. on paper).  \n",
      "\n",
      "Aware of its responsibility, MedUni Vienna has central facilities and internal guidelines (e.g. Good Scientific Practice) that aim to ensure the uniform handling of research data.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### 5 Responsibilities, Rights and Obligations  \n",
      "\n",
      "The responsibility for research data management in the context of a research activity lies with both the researchers and the MedUni Vienna in accordance with the guidelines of the MedUni Vienna.  \n",
      "\n",
      "#### 5.1 Responsibilities of the Researchers  \n",

      "Meeting the requirements of clients, sponsors, or funding agencies   \n",
      "f. Compliance with all legal, contractual and internal MedUni Vienna regulations regarding research data  \n",
      "\n",
      "#### 5.2 Responsibilities of MedUni Vienna  \n",
      "\n",
      "MedUni Vienna undertakes to create the conditions for the fulfillment of this Policy by promoting research-supporting practices.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The following duties fall under the responsibility of MedUni Vienna:  \n",
      "\n",
      "a.  Measures to raise awareness of the importance of research data management (e.g. Third Party Funding Manual, Good Scientific Practice)   \n",
      "b. Provision of directives for the uniform handling of research data   \n",
      "Offering education and training in the area of research data management   \n",
      "d. Provision of templates for data management plans, as well as guidance and training on creating and maintaining data management plans   \n",
      "Technical assistance, according to financial possibilities, and advice on the collection, documentation, storage, retrieval, archiving, and, if necessary, destruction of research data   \n",
      "f. Provision of a processing directory in accordance with Art. 30 of the GDPR   \n",
      "g. Advice and training on data protection with special attention to personal data   \n",
      "h. Establishment of central institutions such as the intramural Data Protection Commission, the Data Clearing House, an ethics commission, and a data protection officer  \n",
      "\n",
      "### 6 Validity  \n",
      "\n",
      "This policy was slightly adapted and confirmed by the Rectorate on January 13, 2021. It will be reviewed for validity by the Rectorate of the Medical University of Vienna at least every three years.\n",

      "\n",
      "The research data management policy aims to make data management easier for the individual researcher. Managing and curating data creates competitive edge, and allocating resources for that is a strategic choice of the university. The purposes of this policy are to (1) encourage to informed decision making in research data management and (2) define the principles used in the opening of publicly funded scientific research data to achieve wide societal impact and the strategic goals of Aalto University.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The data management policy shall be implemented through conscious and strategic decisions. Open access publishing of research data aims to make research data easily discoverable, assessable, intelligible, usable and interoperable. Where applicable, these requirements can also be applied to data other than open access published research data, and to the software needed to handle the open data. The decisions to publish software, other than the software explicitly needed to handle the data, are done using the same conscious and strategic grounds as opening of the research data.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Ownership of copyright protected research data is transferred to Aalto University if the data is created in an externally funded research project of Aalto University.  Strategic decisions about opening such data are done by the principal investigators. These decisions are done following the guidelines for ethical principles of research as well as the guidelines for responsible conduct of research, project agreements and guidelines for processing of personal data in scientific research,   \n",
      "   \n",
      "\n",
      "Research data is not opened if the opening would violate privacy, safety, security, terms of project agreements or legitimate concerns of private partners. Researchers shall follow the \"Guideline on nondisclosure of information and information security classification at Aalto University\" and its appendix \"Rules on the handling of information materials\".    \n",
      "\n",
      "When deciding on the opening of research data, the possibilities for commercially exploiting the research results and data are taken into consideration. Aalto University will make agreements about the user rights of third parties according to the strategic goals of the university. Aalto University may also charge a fee from third parties for the use of research data.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Openness of scientific research data will increase the scientific impact of the research, speed up the adoption of research findings and the creation of innovations, enable transparency in science, as well as ensure that research data has wide societal impact and usability in solving global challenges.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Opening access to research data shall be made easy for researchers and implemented in a cost-effective manner so that the resources invested are proportioned to the benefits attainable.

      "\n",
      "research data is not specified further in this policy, as the quality and quantity of research data that is chosen for open access publishing is also chosen using the criteria above.

      "POLICY STATEMENT  \n",
      "\n",
      "#### 3.1. General research data management  \n",
      "\n",
      "The University expects that the following general research data management principles will be followed:  \n",
      "\n",
      "Research data should be actively managed to ensure that it is available for access, validation, and re-use (where appropriate). The rights and interests of research participants must always be protected. Researchers must comply with all relevant regulations, funder requirements, contractual obligations, and ethical requirements, as appropriate, at all times during their research.  \n",
      "\n",
      "#### 3.2 Research data  \n",
      "\n",
      "Research data must be:  \n",
      "\n",
      "Accurate, auditable, authentic, and reliable.   \n",
      "Identifiable, retrievable, and available when needed.   \n",
      "Secure and safe with appropriate measures taken in handling sensitive, classified, and confidential data.   \n",
      "Kept in a manner that is compliant with legal obligations, University policy and, where applicable, the requirements of funding bodies; and   \n",
      "Considered for long term preservation.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Clear arrangements for research data management must be in place prior to research data generation. The University recommends that all research projects have an associated Research Data Management plan (RDMP), with named researchers and their responsibilities detailed within. This may be a mandatory requirement as part of a grant application, and your Strategic Funding Manager will advise if so. It is the responsibility of the researcher to consider how legal and ethical restrictions will impact on their ability to share data at the end of the project and it is recommended that these considerations are addressed in a RDMP.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Research data must be stored and disposed of securely according to the relevant retention and disposal schedule, in accordance with legal, ethical, research funder and collaborator requirements and with particular concern for the confidentiality and security of the data. Records relating to research (e.g. master copies of approved consent forms, information sheets, records relating to ethical approval) should be retained for six years after the date of project closure, in line with the University Records Management Procedures. Research data that underpins published results or is considered to have long-term value should be retained.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Research data should be stored on Box unless there are specific reasons why this is not practical, nor in line with a collaboration agreement (for example). In this case advice should be sought from Digital Services in the first instance, and the Research Integrity Office where appropriate.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The deliberate or reckless mismanagement of research data and/or primary materials constitutes unacceptable research conduct and should be reported in line with the University Research Misconduct Policy or the Whistleblowing policy.  \n",
      "\n",
      "#### 3.3 Collaborative research  \n",
      "\n",
      "When participating in collaborative projects, an Aston University lead must be identified to take responsibility for management of research data produced under the auspices of Aston  \n",
      "\n",
      "University. This person is also responsible for ensuring that data are managed appropriately and in line with any relevant contracts and/or ethics approvals in place.  \n",
      "\n",
      "#### 3.4 What to do when you leave Aston  \n",
      "\n",
      "The University expects that researchers will make the necessary arrangements to deposit/archive research data associated with projects which are closed, or transfer/make available data and records which are associated with active research projects. It is expected that transfer will occur via Box, with shared ownership of relevant Box folders with other appropriate researchers within the University, noting that this should be done in line with any relevant contracts and/or ethics approvals in place. For any arrangements where Box cannot be used, Digital Services should be consulted to discuss and approve an alternative mechanism.  \n",

Researchers should clarify the ownership of any datasets which are used or generated and of derivative IP for all research projects or ventures generated in collaborations or partnerships, at the proposal stage or by the start of a project.  Researchers are invited to seek advice from: researchdata@brunel.ac.uk 9. Where research data is generated wholly by the researcher, data ownership will normally belong to the University and/or the research funder.  Researchers are invited to seek advice at the proposal stage or by the start of a project from: researchdata@brunel.ac.uk 10. Where all the researchers working on a publicly funded research project are from HE institutions, it is expected that institutional policies will be derived from RCUK policy and expectations and will be similar in principle. While the lead institution and Principal Investigator (PI)will have overall responsibility for ensuring that research data is made available appropriately, and will do so in line with the relevant institutional policy, where this is not Brunel, no conflict with University policy is expected. 11. Where research data is generated in cross-sector collaborations or where third party data is used, data ownership and management can be very complex.  Researchers working within cross-sector collaborations with industry partners should pay particular attention to data ownership and derivative IP generated to ensure that as a minimum, data which underpins a research publication they produce may be published or deposited in an open access data archive.  Researchers are invited to seek advice from University research support services and should contact researchdata@brunel.ac.uk in the first instance. 12. Researchers should abide by the conditions set by the data owner/s, in particular relating to data confidentiality and sharing. Where this is in conflict with University and/or funder policy on data sharing, they should seek guidance from RSDO and/or the Library who will advise further. 13. Ownership information for all data generated or modified should be recorded in the metadata or embedded within datasets as appropriate. 14. Where data ownership must be transferred to a third party, researchers must retain sufficient rights to make research data openly available for reuse, unless this contravenes funder requirements or conditions of data owners. 15. Researchers must not give away exclusive rights to publish, reuse or store research data to third parties, unless doing so is a condition of funding (eg for reasons of confidentiality, research  ethics). If so, researchers should seek advice in the first instance. 16. Researchers who leave the University to work at another HEI while a research project is ongoing may generally expect to retain access to datasets for the duration of the project: each case may need individual consideration as to the most appropriate way to achieve this. RCUK policy takes precedence, and data must be made available alongside any research publications which are published in affiliation with the University.  In some instances, it may be appropriate for data to be transferred, such as where the research project will be moving to another institution. Researchers should seek advice from researchdata@brunel.ac.uk.  \n",

Where specific regulations with regard to data retention apply, eg from funders, these regulations should prevail, particularly where the required retention period is longer than the University requires.   \n",
      "23. The University is committed to preserving and storing research data and will provide advice and/or data storage facilities for data that is not suitable for deposit in an external data repository or service. Initial advice should be sought from research.data@brunel.ac.uk. The minimum period of storage will be (10 years, or as directed by the funder).   \n",

      "25. There may be limited periods of privileged use of data for RCUK funded researchers to enable publication of research outputs and ensure appropriate recognition for research teams.  In general, the data which specifically underpins a research publication, should be made available alongside the publication. Publisher embargo periods for research outputs, where not in conflict with RCUK policy on acceptable embargo periods for the discipline, will generally apply.   \n",
      "26. Information on embargo periods by publisher and funder is available from    Additional guidance will be developed by the University as funder policy and requirements continue to evolve, and will be made available from the Library website.

      "\n",
      "13 Researchers must also:  \n",
      "\n",
      "Protect confidential, personal, and/or sensitive research data in accordance with the legal and ethical requirements related to the research they conduct. Ensure that ownership of research data and any intellectual property is in accordance with the BNU Intellectual Property Policy and that said ownership is properly established before the start of a project.   \n",
      "Create and adhere to Data Management Plans (DMPs) for research projects in line with funders’ requirements. All plans should address data capture, documentation and metadata, ethical and legal compliance, storage and backup, and selection of data for long term storage. DMP Online provides an online tool to support the creation of Data Management Plans.   \n",
      "Deposit their data in an appropriate data repository and provide sufficient information (such as a metadata record) to ensure that it can be found, understood, and cited. Where data is deposited somewhere other than BNU’s institutional repository (BNU Knowledge Archive), a metadata record should also be created in the BNU repository which describes and points to the data. External repositories, where used, should support the use of Open Researcher and Contributor IDs (ORCIDs) and Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs).   \n",
      "Share data in accordance with the principles of open access (see BNU’s Open Access Policy).   \n",
      "Where possible, researchers should seek to recover any cost associated with research data management from the funding body.  \n",
      "\n",
      "14 All research data must be registered with the University whether it is hosted by the University or retained elsewhere. Researchers are responsible for informing the Research and Enterprise Directorate of the location of the data and who will have access to it. BNU retains the right to store a copy of the data for an acceptable period to ensure regulatory or contractual compliance. Guidance on how to register data with BNU, is available on the Research Data Management pages of the staff intranet.  \n",
      "\n",
      "15 Data should be preserved in accordance with the project specific Data Management Plan, which will outline specific retention periods. These periods may vary depending on the nature of the data and the requirements of specific research projects, as discussed in section 8. The Records Retention Schedule provides guidance on the preservation of data.  \n",
      "\n",
      "16 Not all research data is suitable for long term preservation, for example data which contains highly sensitive personal information that cannot be adequately anonymised, when consent has been withdrawn, or when legal or ethical constraints dictate otherwise. The Classifying Information section on the staff intranet provides guidance on this. Staff can also consult with the University Ethics Panel and the Research and Enterprise Directorate to determine appropriate actions in these cases.  \n",

This being the case, research data produced by Cardiff Metropolitan University will be accurate, complete and reliable and every effort will be taken to ensure data are identifiable and retrievable, and openly available where appropriate.  Data shall be stored in a manner compliant with legal and ethical obligations as well as any requirements specific to the funder of the research.  Where issues of confidentiality and/or anonymity arise, these shall be of paramount importance when considering how and where data will be stored and made available.  \n",
      "\n",
      "4.2 Data will be stored in a secure repository suited to the data set concerned. Where data are stored in an external repository, full details of the location of the data will be registered with the institution and details will be attached to any relevant publications by the Library.  \n",
      "\n",
      "4.3 Data supporting and underlying published research outputs will, wherever possible, be made available upon publication of the output and will be preserved for an appropriate period.  To enable this, sufficient metadata will be recorded and made available to enable others to understand the research and re-use potential of the data. Published outputs will include information on how to access the supporting data.  \n",
      "\n",
      "4.4 The minimum period for retention of research data will be ten years from the date of publication.  However where the funder of the research requires a longer retention period, this will be adhered to.  \n",
      "\n",
      "4.5 Retention periods will be decided as part of the Data Management planning exercise. Once the initial retention period as stated in the Data Management Plan has lapsed, a review will take place to assess whether the data should be retained for a further period.  Data with acknowledged long-term value will be preserved and remain accessible and usable for future research.  Conversely, data which has attracted little interest for more than ten years will not be expected to be retained.  \n",
      "\n",
      "4.6 The storage of outputs and data derived from undergraduate or taught post graduate research projects will be subject to the expectations of this policy where it is the intention to publish the results of the research.  In cases where there is no intention to publish, the storage of the outputs and data will be governed by the regulatory arrangements of the relevant award.  \n",
      "\n",
      "4.7 It is recognised that there are instances where it is necessary to restrict access to research data however, any access restrictions placed on data must be justified and justifiable.  It is anticipated that such restrictions will be related to the maintenance of confidentiality, the protection of the privacy of research participants, commercial sensitivity or issues related to IP.  \n",
      "\n",
      "4.8 Where confidentiality provisions apply, data will be kept in a way that reference to them by third parties can occur without breaching such confidentiality.  Confidentiality agreements to protect intellectual property rights may be agreed between the institution, the researcher and a sponsor of the research. Where such agreements limit free publication and discussion, limitations and restrictions must be explicitly agreed.  \n",

Researchers are encouraged to archive research data that could help defend their research against possible challenges. Data disposal: Researchers should plan for appropriate disposal of research data that are not selected for long-term preservation. Data disposal has to take place in accordance with CBS Information Security Policy, CBS Information Security Rules, and CBS Information Security Instructions.8 Long-term preservation: In accordance with the Danish Code of Conduct for Research Integrity , researchers must ensure that research data selected for long-term preservation remain archived for a minimum of five years after project completion.

      "4. The term ‘research data’ refers to the evidence that underpins the answer to the research question and can be used to validate findings, regardless of its form (e.g. print, digital or physical).  These might include quantitative information or qualitative statements collected by researchers in the course of their work by experimentation, observation, modelling, interview or other methods, or information derived from existing evidence. They may include (but are not limited to) statistics, collections of digital images, sound recordings, transcripts of interviews, survey data, fieldwork notes, artwork, archives, found objects, published texts or manuscripts.  The primary purpose of research data is to provide the information necessary to support or validate a research project’s observations, findings or outputs (Concordat on Open Research Data, 2016).  \n",

All research data created by DMU researchers are the intellectual property of the University, unless subject to a grant, contract or other legally binding agreement signed by the University that stipulates otherwise.  For the avoidance of doubt, where legislative requirements apply, those legislative requirements will take precedence over this policy.  \n",
      "\n",
      "7. All new research proposals for external funding must include research data management plans or protocols (DMPs) in line with the relevant funders’ policies (bearing in mind that some funders may require a DMP to be in place even if they do not ask for it to be submitted to them).  DMPs are also encouraged for research that is not externally funded, in order to enable cross-checking and validation, and support research integrity.  Additionally, it may be the case that individual Faculty Ethics Committees might require a DMP to be submitted with ethics applications.  \n",

      "8. All DMPs should include responsibilities for data collection, documentation and metadata, ethical and legal compliance, storage and backup, selection of data of long-term value, preservation and data sharing.  \n",
      "\n",
      "9. DMPs should ensure that research data are available for access and re-use wherever appropriate and with appropriate safeguards. For example, where the openness of data is restricted as outlined in sections 16 and 17, it may be that metadata is still made available and data sharing for re-use agreed with specific individuals/organisations under an appropriate legal agreement such as a data sharing agreement or a non-disclosure agreement. This would need to be detailed in the DMP.  \n",
      "\n",
      "10. All research data of continuing value to the researcher and/or wider research community, or specified by funding bodies or publishers, or required for legal or other regulatory purposes, must be made openly available unless restrictions apply (see sections 16 and 17).  \n",
      "\n",
      "a. In the case of digital data, this may be achieved by depositing data to a specific domain repository (see section 11 below), or to the University data repository at     \n",
      "b. In the case of non-digital data, this may be achieved by digitising the data and treating it as digital data, or by storing the data, e.g. with DMU Library Special Collections (the University's archive service) and recording the metadata on the University data repository at   including details of how to access the data.  \n",
      "\n",
      "11.It is recognised that the most appropriate location for making data open may be a specific domain repository.  This may be because a funder requires it (e.g. UK Data Service for ESRC-funded research), or because it is the most appropriate for a particular discipline (e.g. Archaeology Data Service).  Data should be deposited in the most appropriate repository, and metadata recorded and made openly available via the University data repository at    \n",

      "13. Research data that may be of future historical interest, including data that substantiate research findings, should normally be offered and assessed for deposit and retention in an appropriate data service, domain repository, the University data repository or (in the case of non-digital material) with DMU Library Special Collections (the University's archive service).  \n",
      "\n",
      "14. The legitimate interests of the subjects of research data, and future historical interests, must be protected, e.g. in accordance with data protection laws, research ethics, human rights and duty of confidence.  \n",
      "\n",
      "15. Where a funding body, publisher or their agent requests exclusive rights to publish or re-use University research data without any assurance that it will be made openly available upon publication, the University’s default position will be to refuse such a request, unless required to grant such rights as part of the terms and conditions of a grant, or under a legal obligation.  \n",

      "16. Where any research is subject to any associated contractual arrangements and/or grant conditions that conflict with this policy, the provisions of such contractual arrangements and/or grant conditions will take precedence.  \n",
      "\n",
      "17.It is recognised that there are sound reasons why the openness of research data may need to be restricted.  For example (but not limited to) the following:  \n",
      "\n",
      "a. where individuals’ legitimate interests would be compromised (e.g. under the Data Protection Act);   \n",
      "b. where data is commercially sensitive;   \n",
      "c. where intellectual property rights do not permit;   \n",
      "d. where the investment of time/money/resources would be disproportionate to the anticipated benefits to the University and/or research community.  \n",
      "\n",
      "18. These are decisions that individual researchers should look at on a case by case basis, for each dataset, and (where the project is funded) may have to justify their decision to the research funder.  \n",
      "\n",
      "19.It is recognised that DMU researchers who generate original data must have reasonable right of exclusive first use for an appropriate and well-defined period, which may vary by subject and discipline area. They may, therefore, wish to set an embargo on the publication of their data. This should be considered from the earliest stages of project planning and set out in the Data Management Plan.  \n",
      "\n",
      "20. DMU researchers are required to comply with the conditions of their research funders’ data management policies.  \n",
      "\n",
      "21. Responsibility for the creation of a DMP (where required), the updating of that plan, and the implementation of the plan throughout the research lifecycle during any research project or  programme lies with the PI or most senior DMU researcher associated with the project.  \n",
      "\n",

      "The most senior Edinburgh Napier University researcher associated with a research project is the Principal Investigator, unless specified otherwise on the funding application, for that project and is ultimately responsible for research data management and planning including making research data open.  \n",
      "\n",
      "In the case of a PhD project, the Director of Studies is responsible. It is their duty to ensure that all members of the research team with access to the research data adhere to good research data management practice.  \n",
      "\n",
      "In the case of collaborative projects, if the Principal Investigator is based elsewhere, the lead researcher at Edinburgh Napier University must take responsibility for all data generated here.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Throughout the lifecycle of the research data, researchers and support staff involved in the management of the data must ensure that the following principles are adhered to in order to achieve the objective of the capture and maintenance of authentic, reliable, open and re-useable data:  \n",
      "\n",
      "1. Researchers must comply with funder data management requirements and are responsible for making themselves familiar with and adhering to legislation (including data protection and trusted research), contractual obligations and funder policies governing their research data.   \n",
      "2. Ensure they undertake training and cognisance of the guidance and support as offered by the University.   \n",
      "3. Seek to recover the direct costs of managing research data from the research funder where possible.   \n",
      "4. Researchers must ensure that active research data are stored securely and protected from loss. University approved systems such as the University networked storage system must be used for storing research data in both original and processed formats. The University has created a central research data file store for this purpose and will provide advice on technical solutions for research data storage and archiving.   \n",
      "5. Ensure that Metadata describing the structure and content of the data is routinely created and updated, whether manually or automatically, for project continuity purposes in line with University metadata standards and conventions guidance. At the end of the project, researchers will ensure that appropriately structured metadata describing the research data they hold is published (normally within 12 months of the data being generated) and made freely accessible on the internet.   \n",
      "6. Ensure data is stored for a period at least as long as that required by any funder or sponsor of the research. Research data must be retained after project completion if they substantiate research findings, are of potential long-term value or support a patent for at least 10 years.   \n",
      "7. Ensure research data that have been selected for retention are made openly available with as few restrictions as possible, unless this would breach legislative, regulatory, contractual, ethical or other obligations, or where the cost of doing so  \n",
      "\n",
      "would be prohibitive. Wherever possible, potential restrictions on data should be described in the project’s data management plan.  \n",
      "\n",
      "8. Register all research data to be openly discoverable with the repository within the University Research Management System, Worktribe, whether they are hosted by the University or maintained elsewhere, even if access to the data is restricted. It is important that the metadata is open even if the datasets themselves cannot be made freely available to comply with FAIR data requirements (Findable, accessible, interoperable and reproducible).  \n",
      "\n",
      "9. Where you are not sure if data can be made available or if the data is restricted and there are concerns about a data access request you should contact RDM@napier.ac.uk  for advice and if necessary to convene the University research data access committee to consider whether it is appropriate to share closed data with another organisation.  \n",

      "\n",
      "13. Ensure published research outputs reporting publicly funded research include a data access statement. This is a short statement describing how and on what terms any supporting research data or underlying research materials may be accessed. Underlying research materials are research data as defined in the Concordat on Open Research Data and can include code, software, numerical scores, textual records, images, sounds, objects and manuscripts. A data access statement should be provided on outputs, even where there are no data associated with the article or the data are inaccessible.  \n",

Research Data Management planning includes measures to be undertaken at every step of the data lifecycle16 to ensure transparency and reproducibility of research. Data management planning starts from the creation and/or collection of data, followed by their analysis, publication, storage, sharing, preservation and reuse. Together, all these steps are continuously documented in a Data Management Plan (hereinafter “DMP”). In addition, RDM can support fulfilling the FAIR Principles by distinguishing data of temporary or permanent relevance according to accepted Community Standards and thus providing a reliable basis for informed decisions on data deletion, temporary retention (usually a minimum of 10 years), or unlimited preservation.  \n",

      "### Research data during research (storage)  \n",
      "\n",
      "In the life cycle of research data it is important to distinguish between the phase in which data is still being manipulated and analysed (mutable data) and the phase in which research data has been processed and become static (immutable data). The same distinction exists for storage (during research) and archiving systems (after research), which have different functional and technical requirements.  \n",

      "#### On-premises storage  \n",
      "\n",
      "On-premises storage refers to storage that is hosted by the UG itself in its own data centres, managed by the Centre for Information Technology (CIT), and that is regularly backed-up. Examples are the X- or Y-drive attached to the university workplace (UWP). Storing your research data on-premises is always preferred over using personal (external) storage devices or cloud storage, for reasons of data security and protection (prevention of data loss and data leak).  \n",
      "\n",
      "#### Cloud storage  \n",
      "\n",
      "Many third-party (non-UG-hosted) systems or applications are available to researchers to help collect, share, analyse and/or visualise research data (e.g. Qualtrics, ArcGIS Online, Google Drive). If third party tools process, hold or retain research data in any form in the course of a research project researchers should specify their use of these systems in their RDMP. The FoA strongly recommends researchers to move their research data to onpremises storage as soon as possible after the collection and/or processing of data is complete and after collaborations on shared (cloud) storage have been concluded.  \n",

      "\n",
      "an academic staff member from the same discipline can understand and verify that data, and possibly replicate the research (data should be accompanied by relevant documentation and metadata); it is accessible in the long term, i.e. stored in a future-proof format.  \n",

      "\n",
      "In case of personal data, the GDPR specifies a storage limitation principle: “Personal data shall be kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed.” The GDPR does not set specific time limits for different types of data, but requires that controllers and processors set limits based on the purposes of the processing or that de-identification measures are taken. Researchers should therefore specify when they plan to remove the personal data they have collected, or what (de-identification) measures they have taken to be able to retain their data, in their RDMP.  \n",

      "### Research data publication  \n",
      "\n",
      "Research data publication ranges from making data findable (registering the availability of a dataset externally) to making data completely and openly available for reuse. Any dataset can be registered in the UG Research Portal (using PURE) so that it is findable externally. Additionally, researchers can upload archived research data to an external repository. A data repository is a place that holds data, makes data available to use, and organises data in a logical manner. A data repository may also be defined as an appropriate, subject-specific location where researchers can submit their data. The FoA strongly encourages researchers to deposit their data and software in an appropriate data repository to enhance their findability, accessibility and impact. Following the FAIR adagium “as open as possible, as closed as necessary” the researcher  \n",

      "\n",
      "Research software is defined as any piece of code or script that enables researchers to process, manipulate, generate and analyse data or automatize or test these procedures. The availability of software developed for the purpose of producing research results, together with the respective research data, is essential for the reproducibility and transparency of research. The FoA strongly advises researchers who work with research software to seek the help of the DCC for drafting a Research Software Management Plan in the research design phase, in preparation of software publication after research.  \n",

The line manager (chair holder) monitors the correct and complete deposit of the research data. PhD students are obliged to properly deposit and describe their research data at the end of their research project (or when leaving the FoA prematurely). The GSH coordinator (in consultation with the supervisor) checks whether all relevant data has been deposited. The PhD defence ceremony will not be scheduled if this requirement has not been met.\n",
      "# Faculty of Humanities Research Data Management Policy July 2020  \n",
      "\n",
      "## About this document  \n",
      "\n",
      "This document sets out the policy on the management of research data (hereinafter data) at the Faculty of Humanities of Utrecht University. This policy outlines the criteria and guidelines for adequate data management and specifies the various roles and responsibilities of the parties concerned at the faculty.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The document is divided into three parts:  \n",
      "\n",
      "I. A description of the aim and scope of the data management policy as well as the policy frameworks within which the policy applies. II. A description of the definitions, principles, responsibilities and guidelines for the policy. III. A description of the current support for data management at the faculty and the university.  \n",
      "\n",
      "## I - Aim, scope and frameworks  \n",
      "\n",
      "### Aim of this policy  \n",
      "\n",
      "The aim of this policy is to ensure careful data management within the faculty during and after the completion of research projects. The faculty regulates data management according to the FAIR principles:  \n",
      "\n",
      "Findable: data and metadata are findable, preferably in a digital system.   \n",
      "Accessible: data and metadata are stored and maintained in such a manner that they can be accessed and downloaded easily. In addition, there are clear provisions on accessibility and use.   \n",
      "Interoperable: data and metadata are available in common formats and conform to regular standards so that the exchange and the combining of such data with other data or metadata is optimally facilitated.   \n",
      "Reusable: data are described in a manner that facilitates research reproduction and/or the combining of the data with other data.1  \n",
      "\n",
      "The policy focuses on digital data. The faculty aims to store research data in a digital format, as much as is possible. Particular focus is placed on data containing personal data or data to which intellectual property provisions apply.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### Scope of this policy  \n",
      "\n",
      "The policy applies to everyone who is affiliated with the Faculty of Humanities at Utrecht University and conducts research, including internal and external PhD candidates, but explicitly excluding students.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### Rules, policy frameworks and conditions  \n",
      "\n",
      "This policy represents the further implementation of a number of laws, regulations and policy frameworks, primarily the Utrecht University Policy Framework for Research Data and the Netherlands Code of Conduct for Research Integrity, in which the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has been taken into account. Furthermore, the policy is in line with the wishes and requirements of research grant providers in the area of data management, in particular the  \n",
      "\n",
      "Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) and the European Research Council (ERC), and the principles of Open Science.  \n",
      "\n",
      "## II - Definitions, responsibilities, principles and guidelines  \n",
      "\n",
      "### Definitions  \n",
      "\n",
      "#### Research project  \n",
      "\n",
      "In this document a research project means: all the activities conducted by researchers aimed at arriving at a scientific analysis or opinions, irrespective of whether they are reflected in or are geared towards publications (or other forms of output).  \n",
      "\n",
      "#### Research data  \n",
      "\n",
      "Research data are all the data or procedures (such as algorithms) used for a research project that form the basis for the results or lead to results.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Research data may take many forms including but not limited to: observations, documents, literature references, archaeological material, books, transcribed interviews, source codes, software scripts, parameter settings, theoretical models, simulations and measurements. All the material needed to reproduce research results is regarded as research data and requires adequate data management.  \n",
      "\n",
      "It is common practice to differentiate between unprocessed (primary/raw/rough) data, the procedures that cleanse, anonymise and prepare the data, and the final secondary ‘cleansed’ data.  \n",
      "\n",
      "#### Personal data  \n",
      "\n",
      "The GDPR defines personal data as: any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person who is still alive. This means information that either relates directly to a person or can be traced back to that person.2 Personal data can also be provided to third parties, for example, during interviews or in open questions for surveys.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Research projects in which interviews or surveys are used often involve personal data, i.e. the contact details of the research population. Even though personal data usually are irrelevant for the research, they do form part of the total research data and partially safeguard the integrity of the research.  \n",
      "\n",
      "#### Data package  \n",
      "\n",
      "A coherent set of data and procedures that has been stored unchanged for a longer period of time (archived). A data package contains a description, also referred to as metadata, which clearly shows the content of the package. Based on the data package and the accompanying metadata, it must be possible to validate the claims that are based on the data concerned.  \n",
      "\n",
      "A data package can consist of different data, such as multiple tables, scripts for statistical processing, stimulus material, audio files containing interviews and the interview transcripts in text files.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Archiving (of data packages)  \n",
      "\n",
      "This refers to the storage of data in an unchanged form for a longer period of time. In many cases data are packaged together with a code book, a lab journal (or archive journal) and a description of the data, the metadata. The set of data and the accompanying description are referred to as a data package. Data packages are archived at the time at which a scientific publication is based on the data package or at the end of a research project.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Publication (of digital data)  \n",
      "\n",
      "If the data are archived as a data package, the package can subsequently be published. This means that the data package will be findable. In practice, the publication of a data package means that the metadata are published (in a data catalogue, for example).  \n",
      "\n",
      "Although publication makes a data package findable, this does not mean that the data are automatically accessible: a data package can be published as a ‘Closed Access Package’ (see also p. 6). A persistent identifier, a reference that enables the clear referencing and easy localisation of digital data, is assigned upon publication of the data package.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### Responsibilities  \n",
      "\n",
      "A general principle is that every staff member is expected to manage relevant data as a good steward. In addition, Utrecht University specifically distinguishes between the following actors, each bearing their own responsibilities for data management.  \n",
      "The Executive Board draws up, ensures monitoring and facilitates the implementation of the general university framework, for example, through the provision of infrastructure, information and other forms of support.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### Principles  \n",
      "\n",
      "Data storage and archiving  \n",
      "\n",
      "The management of research data often relates to forms of storage. A distinction is made between the storage of data used in ongoing research projects and archival storage (see p. 6).  \n",
      "\n",
      "The storage of data used in ongoing research projects relates to data and scripts that have been created, adjusted and possibly deleted again during the course of the research project. In archival storage the data are stored unchanged for a predetermined period of time.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The principle underlying the faculty policy is that archival storage must be used as soon as the data concerned are used to substantiate a scientific claim, for instance, for a scientific publication.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### Rights  \n",
      "\n",
      "Utrecht University has the authority to make decisions on data packages stored under the management of Utrecht University on its own infrastructure to the extent that these decisions do not conflict with earlier agreements made with the researcher(s) or between the researcher(s) and other rightholders. Examples are: transferring the data package to another data archive (such as DANS Narcis) or the migration of file formats. Exclusive rights for the reuse or publication of research data will not be transferred to commercial publishers and their representatives without the owners themselves retaining the right to make available the research data for reuse through open access, unless this originally was a precondition for the provision of funds.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Any researcher who is responsible for a research project must draw up a data management plan (DMP) in any event prior to publication, but preferably before the start of the research project. The DMP should at least describe what data will be collected as part of the project, where the data will be stored and who has access to the data during the research project. It also states where (a version of) the data is archived as a data package, how the data package can be found, who can access it and under what conditions.  \n",
      "\n",
      "If personal data are used in a research project, the DMP should explicitly describe what additional measures have been taken to ensure the lawful and careful handling of personal data. This might include a description of the legal basis for collecting the data (e.g. informed consent), the anonymisation method, and processing upon completion of the project (e.g. the destruction of contact details). Furthermore, a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) must be carried out.3 Finally, the data collection must be registered by the faculty data manager. The responsible researcher initiates these activities and ensures completion in the correct manner.  \n",
      "\n",
      "In the case of human subject research, a proposal should furthermore be submitted to the Faculty Ethical Review Committee (FETC) prior to conducting the research.4 Data may not be collected until a positive assessment has been received.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### Regulations  \n",
      "\n",
      "Storage of data packages  \n",
      "\n",
      "Research data must be managed in accordance with the applicable university requirements relating to information security, privacy protection and transparency.   \n",
      "During the research project, data must be stored in an environment with an access restrictions option and back-up facilities. The standard environment provided by the faculty for this purpose is YODA. Other options are the O: drive or SURFdrive. Researchers can consult the Research Data Management Support website to identify a suitable storage environment.5 Researchers may propose using a different environment and should first submit a proposal to the faculty data manager.   \n",
      "If the data contain personal data, the use of YODA as a storage environment is obligatory. It is possible to derogate from this obligation but only with the permission of the Information Security Officer. Local storage is temporarily permitted, for example, because data have been recorded on a peripheral device. However, the data must be encrypted for local storage, and transferred to YODA as soon as possible and destroyed locally. Further guidelines for the storage of data containing personal data follow below.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Handling data containing personal data  \n",
      "\n",
      "Legal requirements laid down in the GDPR apply to the processing of personal data. Researchers attached to the Faculty of Humanities must therefore process personal data in accordance with the requirements laid down in the GDPR, and in accordance with the requirements laid down by Utrecht University and the Faculty of Humanities. In general, this means that6:  \n",
      "\n",
      "o Before creating a data collection, the researcher must carry out data classification and a DPIA, supported by the faculty data manager or otherwise.7   \n",
      "o Limit: only the personal data required for the research are collected. If, prior to the research, the purpose for which personal data are used to answer a research question is not clear, those personal data should not be collected.   \n",
      "o Separate: directly identifiable personal data must be separated from the other data and replaced by pseudo codes as soon as possible. Files in which the directly identifiable personal data and the corresponding pseudo codes are recorded, the ‘key files’, must be separated from the other research data.   \n",
      "o Inform: as far as is possible, the persons concerned will be informed of the research and requested to grant permission for use of their data.   \n",
      "o Provide control: as far as is possible and/or reasonable, research subjects will be given the opportunity to inspect their data, correct their data or withdraw from the research.   \n",
      "o Render unidentifiable: data containing personal data are archived only after anonymisation so that the data cannot be directly traced back to individuals. Anonymisation can be carried out using aggregations, or pseudo codes to replace the personal data.   \n",
      "o Hide: data containing personal data must be stored in locations with encryption.   \n",
      "o The storage or transmission of such data outside the European Economic Area is not permitted.   \n",
      "o Data containing personal data may only be exchanged with third parties provided that explicit agreements (transfer or processing agreements)8 have been concluded for that purpose. As soon as (a version of) the data form the basis for a scientific claim expressed in a scientific publication, for instance, the data concerned are packaged together in a data package, archived and published.   \n",
      "The data package contains, to the extent possible, all the necessary data, descriptions, scripts and images in order to: o reproduce the research results;   \n",
      "o retrieve the origin of the data;   \n",
      "o understand the collection method;   \n",
      "o identify the staff involved in creating the data package;   \n",
      "o understand the objective of the research;   \n",
      "o know the conditions for reusing the data;   \n",
      "o know the minimum storage duration.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Depending on the archive, repository or storage environment selected, the researcher can include most of the above information in the standard metadata forms currently available. All the information the researcher is unable to include in the metadata forms should be recorded in a text file that is added to the data package.  \n",
      "\n",
      "As stated earlier, YODA is the faculty's preferred digital archive and publication platform.9 Other data archives, repositories or storage environments may be used. Researchers should consult the Research Data Management Support website to identify a suitable archive environment. Researchers may propose using a different environment and should first submit a proposal to the faculty data manager.   \n",
      "In principle, data must be anonymised before being archived. Data that cannot be anonymised are archived and published as a data package referenced as ‘Closed Access’. Closed Access data packages can only be accessed by the data owners.   \n",
      "Data to which rights apply, such as copyrights, and therefore cannot be archived for a prolonged period or included in the publication of a data package, must be deleted prior to archiving.   \n",
      "Data packages are made available as Open Access data to the public, provided that there are no compelling reasons for providing the data under Restricted Access or Closed Access. The Faculty of Humanities’ preferred user licence is Creative Commons Attribution/Share Alike 4.0.10 Where possible, the original (primary/rough) data must be archived, together with the scripts used to transform and analyse the data.   \n",
      "For maintenance purposes and to ensure long-term accessibility, data files should be archived in ‘sustainable’ file formats, where possible. The Faculty of Humanities uses the DANS list for this purpose.11   \n",
      "All individuals whose names are recorded in the data package are also identified by a persistent identifier in addition to their first and surname. The Faculty of Humanities uses ORCID as the identifier for individuals12.   \n",
      "In principle, data are archived for a period (the retention period) of at least ten years in a data package.   \n",
      "If data have been archived in YODA, the faculty independently decides at the end of the retention period whether the data should be archived for a longer period and at which location.   \n",
      "After the data have been archived in a data package, the metadata of the package are published (in other words the metadata are distributed) and the data package is assigned a unique identifier. This occurs automatically in most repositories at the time of archiving. The Faculty of Humanities uses DOI as the persistent identifier for data packages.13  \n",
      "\n",
      "## III – Data management support  \n",
      "\n",
      "Comprehensive support is available for data management in the form of information on the Research Data Management Support site.14 Templates for data management plans, standard processing agreements and other documents can be found on the website. Practical support can also be requested for all kinds of topics relating to data management, such as handling data within a consortium and the use of software.  \n",

      "According to good scientific practice, research data must be archived and made available by the end of a project. In particular, public access has become a necessity in recent years in order to facilitate the traceability of research results as well as subsequent reuse of the data. It is recommended to publish research data following the principle \"as open as possible, as restricted as necessary\".  \n",
      "\n",
      "There are various ways to publish research data. In addition to domain-agnostic repositories, a large number of discipline-specific repositories exist. To find a suitable repository for your research data, the portal re3data.org 6  provides extensive search and filter capabilities. In addition, there are special data journals for publishing research data. In some disciplines it is common practice to publish data as a supplement to the respective article. However, this form of data publication has the disadvantage that the data can only be found via the article and does not form an independent, citable publication object  \n",
      "\n",
      "When selecting a publication method, the following criteria should be taken into account: long-term availability (at least 10 years), allocation of persistent identifiers (e.g. DOI, URN), licensing and usage terms of the data, visibility and cost.  \n",
      "\n",
      "As a member of the FSU, you may publish and archive research data with the Digital Library of Thuringia (DBT)7.  \n",
      "\n",
      "If you published research data with an external repository, you are requested to register this publication with the Digital Library Thuringia, too.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Individual websites (e.g. of projects, departments, employees) are generally not suitable for the publication of research data. The long-term availability of such websites is often not guaranteed and non-ambiguous identification (keyword: PID) and cross-referencing is limited.  \n",
      "\n",
      "When selecting the data to be published, the DFG (2015) recommends, \"Data should be made accessible at a stage of processing that allows it to be usefully reused by third parties (raw data or structured data).\" In particular, data that served as the foundation of a scientific article should be made public.  \n",
      "\n",
      "As with scientific articles, research data should also receive a unique, persistent identifier (PID). A PID (e.g. DOI, URN) is typically provided by the repository or data journal at the time of publication. In order to mandate usage and exploitation rights of your research data, data should always be published with a corresponding license. The selected license should allow at least open access for scientific purposes. Specific requirements of the funding organisation or repositories may apply and need to be considered. Suitable data licenses are available from Open Data Commons8 or the Creative Commons9. In general, research data should be published as soon as possible. However, there may be reasons to publish research data with an embargo period. In this case, the data is submitted to the repository for archiving, but it is only accessible after the end of the embargo period. The researchers who are responsible for the data determine the length of the embargo period, unless otherwise requested by the policies and guidelines of funding organisations or the repositories. Embargo periods should not exceed 1-2 years after the end of the project.  \n",

      "### 9.1 Basic principles  \n",
      "\n",
      "Before, during and after a research project at Hasselt University, research data can be recorded in high-quality facilities as provided by Hasselt University. Through its portal site, the university offers technical and practical support.  \n",
      "\n",
      "However, in case research data are managed in external facilities, the researcher will clearly indicate this in the data management plan and clarify how, when and by whom these data can be consulted.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### 9.2 Storage and backup of research data during the research project  \n",
      "\n",
      "Storage of research data during the research project  \n",
      "\n",
      "Preferably, researchers make use of the facilities provided by Hasselt University (e.g. Google Drive). (S)He should use a shared storage platform (e.g. Google Shared drive). Via such shared platform, one should share his/her research data with his/her hierarchical responsible and, if applicable, with the members of the research group. The alternative of a personal storage platform (e.g. Google My drive) should only be used for personal (yet work-related) files, or if collaboration with partners within or outside Hasselt University is not necessary.  \n",
      "\n",
      "However, if researchers choose to make use of external facilities, they should first seek permission to do so via the IT Service Desk. In this case, the researcher himself/herself and his/her hierarchical responsible accept responsibility for the high-quality storage of the research data.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, researchers are strongly discouraged from using media that are highly susceptible to damage and loss to store their research data, including e.g. local hard drives, external hard drives, USB drives, etc.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### Backup of research data during the research project  \n",
      "\n",
      "A backup is essential to safeguard important and valuable research data in case of loss of or damage to the data on the original carrier. If one makes use of the institutional facilities mentioned above, such backup strategy will be provided by default. However, if one chooses to make use of an external facility, the researcher himself/herself will be responsible for implementing a backup strategy. For more information, one should contact the Central Information Technology Service (CID).  \n",
      "\n",
      "### 9.3 Preservation of research data after the end of the research project  \n",
      "\n",
      "Research data that were generated or collected within the framework of a completed research experiment or analysis, and that the researcher considers to be valuable for (re)use, verification, valorization or data collection, should be preserved. Moreover, when the research data are part of a scholarly publication or patent application, they must be preserved in any case.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Research data should be preserved in their most original (or raw) condition in order to make (re)use, verification, valorization and data collection possible. In addition, the data should be preserved as far as possible in a standardized (that is, uniform) and safe manner and – if applicable – in accordance with international disciplinary guidelines. This implies that the researcher takes into account (legal) requirements on anonymization, pseudonymization and encryption, as set forth in §8. Similarly, the researcher should comply with the guidelines concerning data management, as formulated by the Information Security Committee (see attachment 1, §7). In addition, research data should always be accompanied by the documentation that is necessary to understand their origin, generation, collection, processing and analysis.  \n",
      "\n",
      "For archiving research data after the end of a research project, researchers preferably make use of an external disciplinary database, next of the institutional repository or cloud-based facilities provided by Hasselt University, and finally of an external general database.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### 9.4 Preservation period  \n",
      "\n",
      "After the research experiment and analysis have been wrapped up, the raw research data that are relevant for (re)use, verification, valorization or data collection, must be preserved for a period of minimum five years, at least insofar as legal, contractual or disciplinary regulations don’t deviate herefrom. If the research data contain personal data, the researcher should always comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). If the research data are part of a publication, this term can be extended to a period of minimum five years after the official date of publication.  \n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, if the costs for data curation are in proportion to the academic, socio-cultural or economic added value of the (relevant) research data, the latter can be archived for the longer term, that is after the minimum preservation period of five years has elapsed. Such long-term preservation is only decided upon in close consultation with the researcher or his/her hierarchical responsible.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### 9.5 Disposal of research data  \n",
      "\n",
      "Researchers should destroy research data that are not (no longer) relevant for (re)use, verification, valorization or data collection – at least insofar as legal, contractual or disciplinary regulations don’t deviate herefrom. Besides, researchers leaving Hasselt University should comply with yet additional measures, as set forth in §12.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### 9.6 Hasselt University Metadata Repository for research data  \n",
      "\n",
      "Researchers at Hasselt University are required to submit the descriptive metadata of their datasets resulting from research at Hasselt University, whether or not underlying a peer-reviewed publication, to the Metadata Repository. The latter is integrated in the institutional repository of Hasselt University (Document Server), in which researchers currently already deposit their publications and other research outputs.  \n",

      "\n",
      "A. the administration and management of research data (sets) in accordance with the principles and requirements of these guidelines and in accordance with the rules for ensuring good scientific practice of the Helmholtz Zentrum München (7), B. the collection, documentation, archiving and protection against loss of research data including researchrelated records (metadata). For this, the corresponding DMP is to be used, which specifies standard operating procedures that define the collection, administration, integrity, confidentiality, storage and publication of the data obtained.  \n",
      "\n",
      "C. Compliance with the general guidelines of the center, in the case of third-party funded projects, also the guidelines of the sponsors, and in the case of cooperation projects with external (research) partners, the relevant contractual regulations. The special requirements of the specific individual case must be specified in the DMP.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### 5.2 Each project leader (PL) is responsible for:  \n",
      "\n",
      "A. The creation and implementation of the data management plan (DMP) for the respective project.

      "B. to ensure the reusability and exchangeability of the research data after the end of the project. In particular, this includes the definition of data reuse rights with the assignment of appropriate licenses, as well as the clarification of data storage and archiving with persistent DOIs after the project has been completed.  \n",
      "\n",
      "C. the possible specified destruction of research data and research-related records for data that falls within the scope of the European data protection BER as personal data (patient data, test person data (cohorts)).

      "### 7.1 Definitions  \n",
      "\n",
      "#### 7.1.1 Data Management Plan (DMP)  \n",
      "\n",
      "In order to ensure sustainable data management, a data management plan (DMP) must be drawn up before the start of a research project. It is intended to ensure systematic and permanent handling of the research data generated as part of a research project. In addition, he goes into the copyright, usage, access and first exploitation rights as well as storage during and after the end of the research project.  \n",
      "\n",
      "#### 7.1.2 Researcher/Scientist  \n",
      "\n",
      "Scientists are all employees of the research center who are active in research and have a university degree, including bachelor’s and master’s students and guests with the appropriate qualifications.  \n",
      "\n",
      "#### 7.1.3 Research Data (RD)  \n",
      "\n",
      "Research data is all data that is created during the research process, is used for it or is the result of it. Depending on the specific research question and using various methods, they are generated or collected, observed, simulated or derived, then processed, validated, further processed, analyzed, published and finally archived. Accordingly, research data occurs in every research discipline and depending on the stage of its life cycle in different media types and formats, aggregation and quality levels. Research data that form the basis of a publication are part of the scientific output of the center's scientists.  \n",
      "\n",
      "#### 7.1.4 Metadata  \n",
      "\n",
      "Metadata describe research data. On the one hand, they include authorship(s), contact details of the originator (organization), time of creation, licenses and keywords. They define the data formats used and contain the context that led to the data. In addition, metadata can include device settings, environmental conditions (e.g. temperatures, pressures), comments and measurement uncertainties. Metadata are essential for the subsequent use of research data. In addition to use for further research work, this subsequent use also includes verification of research results by third parties.  \n",
      "\n",
      "#### 7.1.5 Research Data Management (RDM)  \n",
      "\n",
      "The term research data management refers to the handling of research data from planning, generation and processing to publication, long-term archiving and, if necessary, deletion in compliance with the rules for safeguarding good scientific practice and the European GDPR. The management of research data therefore affects the entire life cycle of research data.  \n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, the term includes the subject-specific documentation of the processes in the context of their collection. DMP facilitate the documentation of these processes and the description of the data.  \n",
      "\n",
      "#### 7.1.6 Protection of Intellectual Property and the priority right for RD exploitation  \n",
      "\n",
      "The need for protection and the exploitation rights of intellectual property (IP) are defined in the employment contract between the researcher and the center as worker or host and are described in detail in the current IP guideline of the center. Copyright and exploitation rights to all forms of intellectual property can be expanded or specified by further agreements (e.g. third-party funding contracts).  \n",
      "\n",
      "In principle, Helmholtz Munich has the right to decide how research data can be published and shared as a carrier of intellectual property. The treatment of all research data according to the FAIR principles represents the basis for publications and data exchange, but does not enforce the latter. The need for protection of the intellectual property resulting from the research of the center has priority over the exchange of data within the framework of a future open science policy.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The first use of research data is usually one or more text publication(s) in a journal based on this data. The scope and duration of the initial use can be determined by the scientists in the DMP. In particular, the end of the initial exploitation phase should be determined in a context-dependent and justified manner.  \n",
      "\n",
      "#### 7.1.7 Data Publication  \n",
      "\n",
      "Data sets can be published in two ways:  \n",
      "\n",
      "A. by simply making them available via a web interface, preferably at a local data repository of Helmholtz Munich,  or via a citable, dedicated  data publication (linked with a DOI). Such a data publication can include the open distribution of the data and metadata, but does not have to.  Instead it can also  show a simple \"landing page\", which broadly describe the context and content of the data set and via which interested parties can submit a request to the respective decentralized data manager (see above under \"Responsibilities and responsibilities\") for data release.  \n",
      "\n",
      "A central technical tool for the publication of research data is a data repository, a server service on which data can be stored by its creators. This data is given a globally unique identifier (e.g. a DOI) and can be searched and, if necessary, downloaded. A restriction of access by the data producer(s) by means of authorization settings is possible depending on the respective repository.  \n",
      "\n",
      "#### 7.1.8 Licences  \n",
      "\n",
      "The license of a publication is a contract between the publishing and re-using person or institution, which regulates the conditions of re-use. Many license \"types\" are already pre-formulated and are available on the Internet, so reference is made to them here (8). A permissive license restricts subsequent use only minimally. Well-known examples of permissive licenses are CC-00-SA and CC-BY of the Creative Commons.   \n",

      "### 7.2 Legal Status of Research Data  \n",
      "\n",
      "Ownership of data does not exist in Germany. However, copyright guarantees everyone the protection of their intellectual creations. Whether research data is subject to the protection of copyright law depends on whether the requirements for the level of intellectual creation or the requirements of database law are met. Both requirements are not regularly met for research data colelcted in routine measurements. Depending on the type of collection, research data can have a level of intellectual creativity that is worthy of protection. In order to ensure legal certainty, it should always be assumed that it is worthy of protection, that is rights of use and exploitation are usually to be clarified contractually with external partners. Careful licensing of published data must also be ensured.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Regardless of the right to the data obtained, the question of the right of exploitation must be seen. The researcher or the research institution can assert a (temporary limited) right of first use of the data obtained as part of their research activities in the form of publications or patents.  \n",

      "# RESEARCH DATA MANAGEMENT POLICY  \n",
      "Definitions  \n",
      "\n",
      "Research data: the term ‘research data’ refers to all forms of information, commonly accepted in the academic community, that is collected, observed, generated, or created as necessary to validate research findings and conclusions. Examples include geospatial and remote sensing data, statistics, field and laboratory measurements, experimental and observational data, surveys, interviews, video and audio recordings, photos and images, analysis scripts, etc. (Kruse & Thestrup, 2018). Research data also include secondary documents such as policy reports and data obtained from literature review. Research data do not include the following materials: drafts of academic papers, plans for future research, peer reviews, or communication with colleagues.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Research project: In this policy, a research project refers to a detailed study of a subject aimed to solve specific research questions or objectives. It involves the collection, analysis, and interpretation of data in order to discover new facts or develop new concepts, generate new findings, and instigate progress. Research projects explicitly include research carried out by master students and academic researchers (PhD candidates, postdoctoral fellows, researchers and senior academic staff, i.e. assistant professors, associate professors, and full professors).  \n",
      "\n",
      "Data management plan (DMP): A DMP is a formal document that describes all data that are to be used in the project, the documentation and organisation of data, data storage during the research process, preservation of data after the project is completed, and finally, the future availability of data for sharing and re-use. The DMP should also provide information on the planned measures to safeguard and protect sensitive data such as personal data (Berez-Kroeker et al., 2022).  \n",
      "\n",
      "Metadata: the term ‘metadata’ refers to structured information about data. Such information makes it easier to understand, discover, use, or manage data. It includes information such as the description of said data, their origin, temporal coverage, geographic location, creator, access conditions, and other descriptive elements (Riley, 2017).  \n",
      "\n",
      "Personal data: In accordance with GDPR, the term ‘personal data’ refers to any information that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person, such as a name, an identification number, a geographical location, an online identifier, or one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person (European Union, 2016).  \n",
      "\n",
      "Classified data: the term ‘classified data’ refers to data that have been classified to a certain level of sensitivity, considering properties such as availability, integrity, and confidentiality, in order to decide the related level of security and protection measures.  \n",
      "Faculty Guidelines and Working Rules  \n",
      "\n",
      "### 5.1 Data Management Planning  \n",
      "\n",
      "Planning data management is essential for every research project and should be an integral part of good research design. Quality research starts with a good DMP. Therefore, for every research project conducted within ITC, a DMP must be written and regularly updated during the project.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Master students must write a DMP for their research and include it in the documents required for the proposal. The DMP has to be reviewed by the supervisors as part of the proposal’s assessment. PhD candidates must follow a Data Management Bootcamp (1 ECTS) offered by UT to learn how to write a DMP for their PhD projects. The DMP must be written within the first year of their PhD trajectory, reviewed by the Faculty Data Steward, and included in the documents required for the PhD Qualifier. The DMP for a PhD project must be reviewed annually by the supervisors during the annual interview and updated where necessary. Any other research project must have a DMP before the start of the said project, but no later than four months after the start of the research, and it must be reviewed by the Faculty Data Steward. The DMP has to be reviewed regularly and updated where necessary and it must be adhered to by all research team members.  \n",
      "\n",
      "A DMP template is available at UT’s DMP-tool. The template has been accepted by the Dutch Research Council NWO, the independent governmental body Care Research NetherlandsMedical Sciences ZonMW, and the EU (e.g., the European Research Council ERC). Therefore, the UT DMP template should be used unless the funding body or their partners require the use of a different template.  \n",
      "\n",
      "For support regarding writing a DMP, contact the Faculty Data Steward  \n",
      "\n",
      "### 5.2 Data Storage  \n",
      "\n",
      "Effective research data management is essential for maintaining the accessibility and security of research data. This section outlines the best practices and guidelines for storing data during research. In principle, all research data collected and generated should be stored safely and protected against unauthorised access, accidental disclosure, and loss. The choice of storage facility depends on many factors, such as the type of data, size, the need for collaboration with research partners, etc.  \n",
      "\n",
      "A copy of key research data (key files of the data collected and generated) and the related materials (e.g. documentation, protocols, models, or questionnaires) must be stored in facilities offered by UT, unless exceptions apply.   \n",
      "In case researchers wish to use their own storage facilities for primary storage, note that UT has strict requirements when it comes to acquisition of research data storage. It is required to ensure that the storage facility is at least ISO 27001-certified and in the case of health data NEN 7510-certified. These two certificates prove that the way data, especially personal and privacy-sensitive data, are stored complies with current security standards. If you need advice regarding the storage certification, please contact the Faculty ICT Account Manager   \n",
      "Portable devices (e.g., external hard drives, USB sticks, or personal laptops) should not be used as the primary storage facility of research data.   \n",
      "Non-digital research data and related materials, such as physical samples, lab notebooks and printed informed consent forms, must be stored in accordance with clearly described procedures and standards within the research group and/or project and must be digitised where possible.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Take a look at the UT storage decision tree which provides an up-to-date overview of UT storage facilities and all other secure storage solutions offered by UT.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Contact the Faculty Data Steward in case you have questions or need support.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### 5.3 Data Sharing and Transfer  \n",
      "\n",
      "Data sharing refers to providing access to data in a way that maintains the data's availability, accessibility, and confidentiality. This section outlines the best practices and guidelines for data sharing with colleagues within or outside ITC during research.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Stored research data should be accessible to at least one other member of the research team other than the main researcher, ideally the principal researcher or a daily supervisor for Postdocs, PhDs, and Master students. Access to the stored data by other research team members is vital to ensure data availability. For collaborative projects involving data sharing, a data sharing agreement, which establishes the terms and conditions under which data are shared and clarifies the roles and responsibilities of both parties regarding the management of the data, should be drawn up in consultation with the Faculty Privacy Contact Person and should be signed by the Faculty Dean prior to sharing research data with external parties.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The UT storage decision tree also offers a range of facilities for data transfer and data   \n",
      "sharing.   \n",
      "There are several types of data sharing agreements, depending on the research project and type of data:   \n",
      "o A data transfer agreement is generally used when sharing non-personal data with third parties;   \n",
      "o A joint controllership agreement is used to establish shared responsibilities regarding the processing of personal data with collaborators. Consortium agreements and Grant Agreements (e.g., Horizon 2020) provide a legal basis for this type of agreement;   \n",
      "o A data processing agreement is used when a third party is involved in the processing of personal data on behalf of the data controller (such as collecting, storing, or analysing the data on your behalf);   \n",
      "o A non-disclosure agreement is typically used for trade or commercial data, including trade secrets and patent-related data.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### 5.4 Data Documentation  \n",
      "\n",
      "Data documentation is crucial to ensure that research data are understandable and re-usable by yourself or by others. In accordance with the FAIR principles,  as a minimum requirement a definite version of research data should be well documented. However, best practice is to start documenting data and record metadata early during the research process and to update these regularly throughout research in order to warrant completeness and accuracy.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Research data, both digital and non-digital, should always be accompanied by metadata to ensure findability and re-usability. Research data must be accompanied by additional documentation (e.g., in the form of a README file, data paper, etc.) to enable correct interpretation and re-use. Clear, concise language and standard terminologies should be used to ensure comprehensibility.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Research data must be accompanied by at least one set of metadata for the entire dataset. However, for comprehensive documentation, metadata should be provided for each distinct type of data or file where applicable or necessary.   \n",
      "Since the data repositories provide machine-readable forms of metadata, most often based on a generic metadata standard such as Dublin Core, it is recommended to provide additional documentation in the form of a README file. This documentation should encompass, but not be limited to the data contents and structure, along with all relevant methodological information (e.g., the collection, processing, and quality control aspects of said data), records of different versions of the data files, and details on sharing and access.   \n",
      "Discipline-specific metadata standards (e.g., the ISO 19115 geographic information metadata standard) can be used to decide on additional information aimed at enhancing the data documentation.   \n",
      "For the local management of your research datasets and related metadata and for publishing them easily to different research data repositories, you can use the fairly toolset. This toolset includes a command line tool and a JupyterLab extension that facilitate creating, uploading, and downloading research datasets together with metadata without requiring programming skills.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### 5.5 Data Preservation  \n",
      "\n",
      "Data preservation refers to the long-time storage of research data to enable the verification and reproduction of research and the re-use of data. Publishing and archiving data are the two most practical ways to preserve data after research.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Digital research data needed for verification and reproduction (at least those underlying all types of academic publications, such as journal articles, reports, theses, etc.) have to be preserved in one of ITC’s approved data repositories or archive facilities for at least ten years after completion of the project (in accordance with The Netherlands Code of Conduct for Academic Practice).   \n",
      "Preserved in a repository, research data can be published publicly, with restricted access, or embargoed. In accordance with the ITC’s Open Science Strategic Plan, the data should be published as open as possible and as closed as necessary, i.e., in case of legitimate reasons, such as ethical reasons, reasons concerning privacy protection and national security reasons, knowledge safety and export control, confidentiality, commercial interest, legal and contractual obligations reasons. However, the metadata must always be made available publicly.   \n",
      "Digital research data that cannot be shared with third parties, including trusted data repositories, must be archived in UT’s archive facility.   \n",
      "Research data underlying master's and PhD research projects must be preserved before graduation. Research data underlying other types of research projects must be preserved no later than one month after completion of the research project. Non-digital research data, wherever possible and appropriate, should be digitised. If the data is to be preserved in non-digital format, they should be stored securely in accordance with the respective department’s common practices.   \n",
      "The primary author and co-authors of academic publications share the responsibility of controlling access and making any decision with respect to the data and, therefore, should all be acknowledged in the metadata of the archived or published datasets as contact persons.   \n",
      "For research projects run by ITC researchers, access to the data with restricted access is controlled by the principal investigator. In situations where the original researchers are not available or no longer affiliated with ITC, access to the data is determined and granted by the department chair.   \n",
      "Archived or published digital and non-digital research data require sufficient documentation to enable proper interpretation and re-use, as described in the section on Data Documentation.  \n",
      "\n",
      "For publishing research data, UT and ITC recommend two trusted research data repositories: DANS and 4TU.ResearchData.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Trusted repositories are the repositories that have received a Core Trust Seal Certification, which warrants the reliability and durability of data repositories and, hence, the potential for storing data over a long period of time.  \n",
      "\n",
      "For archiving research data, UT has a certified facility for long-term research data archiving known as AREDA. It is required to contact the Faculty Data Steward before archiving data in AREDA.   \n",
      "For archiving research data from master research projects, ITC has a separate archive facility.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### 5.6 Data Registration in PURE  \n",
      "\n",
      "The registration of research output in Pure, including research data, is essential for consolidating information from various sources at one single platform in order to offer a comprehensive overview of ITC research activities and their impact.  \n",
      "\n",
      "All archived or published digital and non-digital data must be registered in Pure (UT Research Information), where their metadata information is recorded to increase visibility.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Step-by-step guidelines, including a Demo and more guidance on registering research output, are available on the UT Research Information Website  \n",
      "\n",
      "### 5.7 Personal, Confidential, and Classified Research Data Management  \n",
      "\n",
      "Warranting the protection of confidential data, privacy, and the rights of research subjects is paramount in all research activities conducted within ITC. This section outlines key principles, ctices, and compliance measures related to the handling of personal and confidential data in research:  \n",
      "\n",
      "All research activities involving personal data must adhere to the principles and requirements outlined in the GDPR;   \n",
      "Researchers should only collect the minimum amount of personal data necessary for research purposes. Collecting unnecessary or excessive personal data should be avoided; Researchers and students must report any processing of personal data through GDPR registration using the online UT DMP+GDPR tool;   \n",
      "A Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA), i.e, risk assessment, should be carried out prior to processing any personal data likely to result in high risks to the rights and freedom of data subjects;   \n",
      "Personal data, confidential and classified data must be protected against unauthorised access and loss as much as possible. More particularly, personal data should be stored in a GDPR-compliant data storage facility and, where needed, additional security measures such as encryption should be applied;   \n",
      "Personal data should be anonymised or pseudonymised as soon as possible, preferably immediately after collecting those data. Similarly, secondary datasets containing personal data should be pseudonymised or anonymised immediately after receiving them. Note that unlike anonymised data, pseudonymised data are still personal data;   \n",
      "Prior to sharing research data containing personal data, a data processing agreement should be drawn up in consultation with the Faculty Privacy Contact Person and should be signed by the Faculty Dean. A non-disclosure agreement is required in the case of sharing confidential and classified data; see more details under the “Data Sharing and Transferring” section in this policy;   \n",
      "Personal data needed for verification and reproduction (at least those underlying all types of academic publications, such as journal articles, reports, theses, etc.) have to be preserved in one of ITC’s approved data repositories or archive facilities for at least ten years after completion of the project (in accordance with The Netherlands Code of Conduct for Academic Practice);   \n",
      "Informed consent forms used to collect personal data, either in digital or non-digital form, have to be archived for at least ten years after completion of the research project; Researchers must report any data breaches immediately. Examples of potential data breach include devices containing personal, confidential and classified data being lost or stolen, sharing these data with the unauthorised persons, etc. For more information on data breach, see Cyber Safety at UT;   \n",
      "Research involving human subjects or potentially sensitive data about or from individuals, groups or organisations must be reviewed by the ITC Ethics Committee before the work commences. For other types of research, it is strongly recommended to identify potential ethical issues related to, for instance, the environment, dual-use aspects, low-income countries, or artificial intelligence, through an ethics review.  \n",
      "\n",
      "More information on the appropriate use of personal data in research, including a flowchart and practical guidance, can be found on the UT Cyber Safety Website.  \n",
      "\n",
      "This  pre-DPIA assessment form should be used to find out whether a full DPIA is required.  \n",
      "\n",
      "UT network storage facilities (e.g., P-drive, Unishare,) are ISO 27001-certified, NEN 7510-certified and GDPR-compliant; therefore, they guarantee maximum security for storing and sharing personal data, confidential and classified data during research.  \n",
      "\n",
      "For personal data stored in non-UT cloud storage (e.g., MS Teams, OneDrive, etc.) or on portable devices (e.g., USB sticks, external hard drives, tablets, etc.), encryption is required.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Personal data stored on portable devices must be deleted as soon as possible and no later than at the end of the part of research for which the data are needed (e.g., after fieldwork).  \n",
      "\n",
      "The encryption key must be kept safe and stored in a separate location. Furthermore, it should be shared with at least one other employee in the research group. Generally, this person will be the principal researcher or the chair of the research group.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Non-digital informed consent forms should be digitised where possible. However, UT has an archive service for non-digital informed consent forms. Please contact the Faculty Data Steward for support.  \n",
      "\n",
      "To submit your application for ethics review, visit the ITC Ethics Committee website or contact the Faculty’s Research Support Officer.  \n",

      "\n",
      "Research data are stored and made available in a suitable repository or archiving system and are referenced using persistent identifiers.  \n",
      "\n",
      "When depositing data in a repository, researchers are required to declare their affiliation to the JKU in accordance with the provisions of the \"Guideline for the declaration of affiliation for publications and research projects\"12. In order to maintain the integrity of research data, it must be stored correctly, completely, unaltered and reliably, and must be findable, accessible, traceable, interoperable and, where possible, made available for re-use in accordance with FAIR principles. To enable the re-use of research data or research results by citing the original sources, the currently valid citation rules must be applied.  The storage must be dated, and subsequent changes must be stored as separately as possible from the original data. When dealing with clinical research data, it is recommended that the ALCOA+ principle of good clinical practice be applied.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Whenever personal data is handled, it must be in compliance with the applicable data protection regulations. When handling health data, the increased data protection requirements must be met. According to article 2 paragraph 1 of the GDPR in conjunction with article 4 paragraph 1 of Austrian privacy law, the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation and the Austrian privacy law apply to the fully and partially automated processing of personal data. If data are not processed automatically, but manually instead, the GDPR only applies if the data are stored or are to be stored in a structured file system that is organised according to specific criteria, so that access to the personal data it contains is not only possible by sequentially going through the entire collection, but there is a simplified method of indexing and locating its contents.13 Files and collections of files and their cover sheets which are not arranged according to specific criteria - and are therefore unstructured - are not covered by the GDPR; paper files, for example, such as court files in particular, are not covered.14 Also excluded are data obtained purely orally, acoustically or visually, provided they are not to be stored.15  \n",
      "\n",
      "In the absence of any particular creative achievement (since the implementation and display of results is usually the task of a computer program) - individual data, raw data or results of the mere evaluation or analysis results are in principle not works in accordance with section 1 paragraph 1 of Austrian copyright law and are therefore not protected by copyright, so there is also no provision for licensing.16  \n",
      "\n",
      "However, data collections may constitute databases protected by copyright in accordance with section 40f paragraph 1 of Austrian copyright law (database works). But, if the collection of data does not achieve the necessary level of creativity (simple database), it is not protected as a collective work (section 6 Austrian copyright law); in this case ancillary copyright in accordance with section 76c onwards of Austrian copyright law applies if a substantial investment was required for the procurement, verification and presentation of the contents of the database.17 Whether or what kind of protectability applies to research data requires verification in each individual case by the department responsible for data clearing.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Provided that there are no third-party rights, legal obligations, ethical aspects or property regulations to the contrary, research data should be freely licensed and made openly available for re-use, while respecting intellectual property rights.  \n",
      "\n",
      "In accordance with section 2f paragraph 3 of Austrian research organisation law, the minimum archiving period for research data is 10 years from publication of the research results or completion of the research activity. The administrative documents accompanying the research activities must also be archived. If research data and records are to be (or have to be) erased or destroyed, this may only be performed using a standardised process, taking into account all legal regulations, especially internal university regulations and ethical aspects. Principal investigators or their legal successors must be informed and offered the opportunity for the research data to be handed over. All measures taken must be documented and be accessible for possible later assessment.\n",

      "\n",
      "Research data are the foundaƟon and the result of scienƟfic work. The responsible handling of research data ensures replicability, verifiability and reusability of research results and is thus a fundamental aspect of good scienƟfic pracƟce. Justus Liebig University acknowledges the importance of sustainable research data management and regulates the handling of research data for all members of the university in the following principles, irrespecƟve of data protecƟon requirements and the guidelines for ensuring good scienƟfic pracƟce.  \n",
      "\n",
      "1. Research data refers to all data that are gained in the process of doing research through observaƟon, collecƟon, measurement, experiment, simulaƟon and processing or that are the result thereof. This also includes the documentaƟon and soŌware necessary for the understanding of such data. Depending on scienƟfic discipline and faculty culture, research data can exist in different types, aggregaƟon levels and formats.   \n",
      "2. Research data management includes all handling of research data, ranging from planning the data collecƟon and storage to assuring data quality and processing data to making data available or publishing it. Research data management is oriented towards the current professional standards and takes discipline-specific requirements into account. Handling research data will be documented in a research data management plan at an early stage of a research project and, if necessary, is to be adjusted to the process of the respecƟve project.   \n",
      "3. According to research data management, researchers are required to secure research data safely, appropriately process and document research data, and store research data in the long-term (at least for 10 years). The protecƟon of personal data as well as compliance to copyright and legiƟmate interest of third parƟes must be ensured. The principal invesƟgators of research projects are responsible for guaranteeing these processes.   \n",
      "4.

      "Foundational principles for research data management  \n",
      "\n",
      "Karlstad University is the principal research institution for the research carried out by staff or affiliated staff at the university. Research data collected by researchers or doctoral students belong as a rule to Karlstad University. This means that the university has ownership6 to research data, and also responsibility for managing research data in a legal, appropriate and secure manner.  \n",
      "\n",
      "An important principle regarding research data is that it shall be preserved and accessible so that primary material and data analysed can be used without problem to support and verify the methods and results of the research.  \n",
      "\n",
      "All research projects at Karlstad University shall undergo ethical review and be registered in the university registry, according to the review process decided by the vice-chancellor.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### 3.1 Public documents  \n",
      "\n",
      "Karlstad University is a public authority under the government. This means that research data management must comply with the basic principles applying to all public authorities’ handling of public documents.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Research data collected outside of Karlstad University become public documents when submitted to the university. Research data created at the university as a rule are to be seen as drawn up public documents when the data are finalised in the research process.7  \n",
      "\n",
      "Research data shall be stored in an easily accessible way as long as they are deemed valuable for  further research and also be prepared for long-term storage and archiving in accordance with the regulations of the National Archives and the university’s guidelines.  Research data can only be disposed of if there is a rule allowing it. Disposal must follow the local rules on procedures at Karlstad University.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### 3.2 The principle of public access to information  \n",
      "\n",
      "The principle of public access means that the public and the media have the right to insight into governmental authorities’ operations.  In principle, this means that Swedish as well as foreign citizens have the right to request reading the documents held by Swedish authorities. Generally speaking, this also applies to research data collected or created at Karlstad University.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The right to request documents is, however, restricted in two ways. First, not all documents held by an authority are public documents; second,  certain information in public documents can be confidential (secrecy marked).  Before research data are provided under the public access principle, a secrecy assessment must be made in each individual case.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### 3.3 Data protection management and ethical review  \n",
      "\n",
      "The General Data Protection Regulation8 (GDPR), in brief, means that personal data may only be collected for certain justified reasons, that no more data than necessary may be treated, that data may not be stored for longer than necessary, and that treatment should be justified and reasonable in relation to the individual’s basic rights and freedoms. It is also important to ensure that personal data are handled in a secure way and that no more people than those authorised have access to the data.  \n",
      "\n",
      "If  sensitive personal data (article 9 GDPR) or information of criminal offences (article 10 GDPR) are treated for research purposes, also the rules stipulated in legislation pertaining to ethical review of research on humans must be considered. When these types of personal data are treated, the approval of the Ethical Review Authority is always required. Applicants are first  to be submitted to the local ethics board at Karlstad University.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### 3.4 Information security  \n",
      "\n",
      "Information security involves protecting information against various forms of threat by adapting the technical, physical and administrative environments in which the information is handled. With regard to the delicacy of information and the risks involved in the handling, Karlstad University has a general responsibility for implementing appropriate technical and organisational protective measures to ensure and be able to demonstrate that the information is handled appropriately and in compliance with current legislation.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Research data must therefore be handled to ensure that information is protected against unauthorised access (confidentiality), erroneous changes (accuracy), and that the information is accessible when needed  (accessibility). It is also important to make sure that the information cannot be changed, requested by or provided to any unauthorised persons (traceability).  \n",
      "\n",
      "The two most important measures for achieving appropriate information security for research data is either to classification of information to be treated (i.e. completely insignificant information, sensitive information,  personal data, sensitive personal data or confidential information), or to use the IT resources available for the purpose at Karlstad University. As a rule, research data shall only be handled in the IT systems and cloud services provided by Karlstad University with the appropriate and adapted technical and organisational protection measures.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### 3.5 Research projects with several principal research institutions  \n",
      "\n",
      "Karlstad University is principal research institution and responsible for research data generated by various researchers and research groups at the university.   However, the situation is more complex when it comes to collaboration projects with four principal research institutions. For such projects, agreements regulating the collaboration should as a rule be drawn up, including how research data will be handled in the project.  How to handle research data can also be documented by drawing up a data management plan for the project.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Research data collected and created at Karlstad University normally belong to the university. If  there are plans to move a research project, or parts of it,  to or from Karlstad University, the  possibilities to transfer, copy or borrow research data should be investigated.9 If research data will be transferred from Karlstad University the National archives must be notified. A researcher who moves from Karlstad University needs to investigate the conditions for transferring data in consultation with Karlstad University and the receiving university before the transfer.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### 3.6 Data management plans  \n",
      "\n",
      "The process of handling research data continues through the whole life cycle of a research project. The process includes collecting, documenting, processing, storing, sharing, archiving and deleting documents.  Proceeding in a structured way and making data accessible will ensure a future reuse of  the material.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Some funders require a data management plan for the research projects receiving funding. The plan shall describe how the data used in the course of research are collected and/or created will be handled after the project completion. Karlstad University recommends that a plan be drawn up for all projects generating research data, also if not required by the funder.  \n",
      "Guidance on how to store data and the current requirements of major funders can be found at the Research Support Office Website.  \n",
      "\n",
      "## Definitions  \n",
      "\n",
      "Research:  The HEFCE definition of research in relation to the REF is:  ‘Research’ is understood as original investigation undertaken in order to gain knowledge and understanding.  It includes work of direct relevance to the needs of commerce, industry, and to the public and voluntary sectors; scholarship [\\*]; the invention and generation of ideas, images, performances, artefacts including design, where these lead to new or substantially improved insights; and the use of existing knowledge in experimental development to produce new or substantially improved materials, devices, products and processes, including design and construction.  It excludes routine testing and routine analysis of materials, components and processes such as for the maintenance of national standards, as distinct from the development of new analytical techniques.  It also excludes the development of teaching materials that do not embody original research.  \n",

      "Research Data:   This is not easy to define in a comprehensive way it is therefore important for each researcher to consider this in detail in the context of their own project.  To give a broad view the University of Melbourne uses the following definition:  “Research Data are facts, observations or experiences on which an argument, theory or test is based.  Data may be numerical, descriptive or visual.  Data may be raw or analysed, experimental or observational.  Data includes:  laboratory notebooks; field notebooks; primary research data (including research data in hardcopy or in computer readable form); questionnaires; audiotapes; videotapes; models; photographs; films; test responses.  Research collections may include slides; artefacts; specimens; samples.  Provenance information about the data might also be included: the how, when, where it was collected and with what (for example, instrument).  The software code used to generate, annotate or analyse the data may also be included”.  \n",

Research data must be managed in such a way that, at the latest, - at the point in time of the last publication arising from the research, or at the point in time of the formal completion of the research project it is preserved so that it is at least findable, accessible, comprehensible and reusable in the long term.  \n",
      "\n",

      "research projects will generally formally conclude upon their financial-administrative completion. n explanation of the criteria that are used: Findable The data must be findable for other researchers and involved parties. Its findability improves if it is deposited in a (discipline-specific) data archive or repository. The information about the data (metadata) is then registered in a standardised manner and is findable, also for search engines. Future findability is guaranteed by assigning a persistent identifier to the data. A commonly used identifier for data is DOI (digital object identifier). A DOI is assigned by a data archive or data publisher and is a unique number for a digital object, in this case a dataset. The DOI remains the same even if the location of the dataset (URL) changes. A DOI or other persistent identifier is used in citations or references to the dataset. Accessible: Data accessibility does not necessarily mean that the data must immediately be made fully open. The data will have to be made accessible in some instances, for example for verification by a grant provider or journal, but will remain inaccessible to the wider public. With sensitive data, full publication will never be an option. Research data can be retained under embargo; then only those who have deposited the data have access to it. The duration of the embargo is determined in consultation with the data archive. A further option is only to grant access if a request for access is submitted to the researcher. The researcher then knows who is consulting the data and can reach agreements about its use and reuse. NB: if the decision is made to limit access to the data, it is essential that the metadata (description of the data) is findable. Comprehensible Metadata and any supplementary documentation must describe the data in such a way that other researchers will also be able to understand and use it. Reusable This criterion is further elaborated upon in Article 7. Long-term retention This criterion is further elaborated upon in Article 8. Research data must be stored together with the metadata, other documentation and   \n",

      "Research data must be stored in such a way that it is independent of the underlying equipment/hardware, such as microscopes, scanners or recording equipment. Long-term data formats that are supported by data archives should be used if possible. Retention of hardware can be considered in certain cases, for instance in the case of software that is only compatible with an obsolete computer operating system. Close attention must be paid to the cost/benefit ratio here. 8. Once the research has been completed, the research data must be retained securely for the long term. This means that the integrity, availability and – if required – confidentiality of the data must be guaranteed. The data should be retained according to international guidelines. For digital data this can be achieved by preserving it in a Trusted Digital Repository (an online depot). Non-digital research data must be preserved according to the prevailing standards in the discipline.  \n",
      "\n",
      "A Trusted Digital Repository possesses equipment, hardware and software for the long term and reliable retention of digital information. This facility must be embedded in a reliable organisation that has a long-term mission and funding. There are three prevailing international standards for Trusted Digital Repositories and the manner in which they retain digital data for the long term. In ascending order of reliability requirements these are: the Data Seal of Approval1, the Nestor Seal2 (also known as DIN 31644) and the RAC standards3 (also known as ISO 16363). Data preservation at a repository with a Data Seal of Approval (the lowest category) currently suffices for NWO and Horizon 2020.

      "\n",
      "The Medical University of Graz (Med Uni Graz) recognises the fundamental importance of research data management, including the importance of maintaining the accompanying records, to ensure high-quality research and scientific integrity. It strives to promote the highest standard in this regard in accordance with the FAIR principles. Accurate, easily retrievable and traceable research data are a fundamental and integral part of any scientific research activity. These data are also essential in that they allow research processes and results to be reviewed and defended, among other things. Research data are of lasting value to research and teaching, opening up the potential for their broad use by members of society.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Research data shall be handled exclusively in accordance with the applicable national and international legal provisions.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Due to the diversity of research data and processes, it is not possible to define uniform guidelines for the management of research data in detail (e.g. with regard to file structures, repositories, software, metadata). In addition, both the requirements and data management systems develop differently and extremely dynamically in specific research areas. For these reasons, this policy establishes general principles that are independent of research topics and will be continuously adapted as a living document to take into account current developments.  \n",
      "Usage rights  \n",
      "\n",
      "Med Uni Graz is entitled to exercise the unrestricted right to use data generated on behalf of or in the interest of Med Uni Graz for commercial and non-commercial purposes of exploitation with regard to all types of exploitation, including the right to edit these data, without any restrictions in terms of time and place. Section 106 (2) and (3) of the UG (Universities Act, in German: Universitätsgesetz) and the applicable provisions of the Patent Act (in German: Patentgesetz) apply to service inventions. The authors or inventors retain the legally reserved right to be named, the right to receive remuneration for service inventions, the right of university staff to independently publish scientific work and the right to be named as a (co-)author in the publication of research results.  \n",

      "# MU Medizinische Universitat Graz  \n",
      "\n",
      "Insofar as the primary right to use the data is contractually granted to third legal entities (e.g. in the case of contract research agreements), it must be ensured that Med Uni Graz is in any case granted those rights of disposal over the data that are necessary to fulfil its data storage obligations to support good scientific practice. Furthermore, Med Uni Graz should be granted the right to use the results generated over the course of research activities for non-commercial research, teaching and, if possible, patient care.  \n",

The personal data to be reviewed should also include genetic and biometric data as well as data derived from biological material. The legality of the transfer of personal, pseudonymised, or anonymised data to third parties must be reviewed during the contractual review as part of the third-party funding process. If a data transfer is planned that is not regulated by a project contract, the research management must be informed in order to initiate a separate review, decision and, if necessary, contractual regulation process. The research management also represents the liaison to the Med Uni Graz data protection officer.  \n",

In any case, compliance with any specifications issued by funding agencies regarding the type of licence to be granted must be ensured.  \n",

      "Research data and their metadata must be kept accurately, completely and reliably in accordance with good scientific practice to ensure the traceability of these data. Furthermore, efforts must be made to ensure the identifiability, findability, availability and, wherever possible, re-usability and interoperability of these data. If possible, the data should be given permanent identifiers.  \n",

These records are considered as part of the data and should be archived together with these (metadata).  \n",
      "\n",
      "The retention period for research data and records is – unless other legal regulations apply - dated least ten years either from the date of publishing the research results or, if no publication takes place, from the date of completing the relevant research activity. Justified deviations may result from the legal regulations (e.g. patent law, pharmaceutical law, requirements for the documentation of patient care), the requirements of third-party funding providers, or specific guidelines issued by the Rectorate.  \n",
      "\n",
      "If research data and records are deleted or destroyed, this must be done in accordance with all legal and internal university requirements and in consideration of the aspect of traceability. The interests of other stakeholders (e.g. funding bodies) as well as aspects of confidentiality and security must be taken into account.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Research data management must be organised at each organisational unit to ensure that individual persons can find and access certain data but also to guarantee the findability and accessibility of the data, even in the absence of individual persons involved in the research process. In justified cases and in accordance with good scientific practice, it must be ensured that direct access (e.g. for managers, project leaders) or indirect access (e.g. for co-authors of joint manuscripts/publications, project partners, research-supporting institutions, authorities) can be granted to relevant original data.

      "\n",
      "The downloading of (particularly terrorism related) security-sensitive materials and visiting of security-sensitive websites can be seen by the authorities as prosecutable offences should the intent behind them be illegal.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Research material which is security sensitive should not be kept on the researcher’s personal computer or on their standard University drive. Before beginning the research, a member of NUITs Information Security Team should be contacted, they will arrange for the set-up of an appropriately secure project drive. Material within this drive will be easy to access but in some cases there will may restrictions preventing its exchange.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Likewise if the research involves visiting security-sensitive websites, the researcher should be aware that many of these sites are under surveillance by the authorities. It is strongly recommended that their University profile (IP address) is used to access these sites, thereby ensuring that their activities are flagged as being a legitimate part of their research and ensure that enquiries come to the institution in the first instance.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Physical data, e.g. manuals / reports should be scanned and a copy uploaded to the secure project file store.  \n",
      "\n",
      "By using a secure file store (along with appropriate ethics approval) the researcher will ensure that, should the University be asked, it can confirm that the materials within it are for research. Please be aware that in order to effectively answer any queries from the security services the Research Strategy and Development will be able to access metadata on the files e.g. titles and date of creation within the secure project drive. It will not however be able to access the content.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### Oversight  \n",
      "\n",
      "The university also has a responsibility to ensure that researchers are not adversely affected (emotionally and intellectually) by the research they undertake. If there are any concerns these should be raised as soon as possible.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Student projects: In the first instance it is the project supervisor’s responsibility to ensure that the students are not adversely affected. Supervisors should be prepared to liaise closely with the student’s personal tutor and student welfare.  \n",

      "\n",
      "Any queries from legitimate bodies e.g. the police or security services will be handled by the Research Strategy and Development in conjunction with the Information Security Team. If an individual receives an inquiry from the Police then the University’s Research Strategy and Development tram should be advised of this.  \n",

      "7 Principles  \n",
      "\n",
      "The principles which underpin the use and management of research data by University staff and students are set out below. These principles are consistent with the principles of data protection set out in Article 5 of the General Data Protection Regulation6 and satisfy the requirements in Schedule 1, Part 4, 39 of the UK Data Protection Act 2018:  \n",
      "\n",
      "i) Research data will be managed throughout the research data lifecycle7 in accordance with the University’s policies, guidelines and standards, and funder, legislative and ethical requirements.   \n",
      "ii) Research data shall in most cases be collected for the purposes of creating new knowledge which is shared with others through publication and dissemination. In these cases, research is normally deemed to be ‘a task in the public interest’ (principles of lawfulness and purpose limitation Art.6 GDPR). In cases where special category data are being processed, then an additional condition will apply. For most research carried out by the University  \n",
      "\n",
      "this will normally be that processing is necessary for ‘scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes’ (GDPR Art.9).  \n",
      "\n",
      "iii) Data management plans should be written for all new research projects, regardless of whether submission of such plans is required when applying for research funding.  The plan must address how the data will be captured, managed, stored, retained, shared, published, and how any confidentiality and data protection issues will be addressed.8 See also Section 10 for further guidance on data management plans.  \n",
      "\n",
      "iv) Personally identifiable data should be anonymised or pseudonymised where possible as soon after collection as possible. Where researchers can undertake some or all of their research activities without using identifiable personal data, they should make arrangements to do so (principle of data minimisation). Where research requires the processing of personal data, and where the University is the data controller, then there must be a clear legal basis for processing and this must be communicated to the data subject (principle of lawfulness, fairness and transparency).9  \n",
      "\n",
      "v) Where personal data are stored and processed for research purposes by University staff this must be carried out in accordance with the University’s information security policy (principle of integrity and confidentiality).10  \n",
      "\n",
      "vi) Data should be made available for access and re-use where legally, ethically and commercially appropriate.  \n",
      "\n",
      "vii) Researchers must provide sufficient metadata and explanatory documentation about their research data to ensure that data are discoverable, understandable and re-useable.  Such metadata will be published by the University, normally within 12 months of the data being generated.  If access to data is restricted, the metadata should outline the reasons for this and the conditions which need to be met for access to be granted.  \n",
      "\n",
      "viii) Data must be retained in an appropriate format for a period of at least 1 year from the end of the project for low risk projects, 3 years for moderate risk projects and 7 years for high risk projects, in accordance with the University’s Research Records Retention Schedule (principle of storage limitation)11, unless other funder regulations apply (for example, EPSRC stipulates a retention period of 10 years, plus an additional 10 from the last date at which access to the data was requested by a third party).  Where possible and applicable, research data that are not in a digital format will be digitised to facilitate access.  \n",
      "\n",
      "ix) Where possible, or if mandated by the funder, retained data must be submitted to an appropriate archive or database for long-term preservation.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Researchers should avoid retaining data using methods that might not persist for 10 years, such as project websites.  \n",
      "\n",
      "x) All data which are created as part of research at Northumbria University must be registered with the University, even if the data are hosted elsewhere.  All reasonable steps must be taken to ensure that research data are not stored in a jurisdiction that offers lower levels of protection than are available in the UK.  \n",
      "\n",
      "xi) Published papers should include a statement describing how, and on what terms, supporting research data may be accessed.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) is committed to the general principle of Open Access to research, including to research datai within the necessary constraints of any funder, legal and ethical requirements, and following QMUL policies, guidelines and standards.  \n",
      "\n",
      "2. Due to the particular concerns around access to medical-related data, access to data that is associated with medical research will be governed by the relevant funder’s policies on datasharing. If a funder does not have such a policy, then the MRC’s policy on data-sharing should be the default policy ii  \n",
      "\n",
      "3. Where reasonably practicable, publicly funded research data should be made available for access, subject to such conditions as are necessary to ensure compliance with legal, data protection, ethical, confidentiality, IP protection, security or funder obligations.  \n",
      "\n",
      "4. Data identified for open access will be offered for deposit either in a QMUL or an appropriate external repository, in accordance with relevant standards and community best practice, which may be determined by the area of research activity.  \n",
      "\n",
      "5. Data must be retained intact in an appropriate format and storage facility according to funder requirements and consonant with any data management plans approved as part of any funding.  \n",
      "\n",
      "6. The rights of researchers to the exclusive use of research data that they generate as part of a well-defined research project will be protected up until the point of publication or public availability.  \n",
      "\n",
      "7. Where data is made available on request rather than via straightforward open access the rationale for this must be made public, and such availability should not be unreasonably withheld.  \n",
      "\n",
      "8. Data arising from research involving human subjects can only be made accessible if those subjects give their informed consent in advance in writing for the future public release of their data, with clear and study- specific explanations of how the data will be anonymised so that it will not be possible for those in receipt of the data to identify any individuals. Where it has been determined that it would be inappropriate to make such data accessible, for example because it might lead to identification of research subjects or because seeking consent would make it unlikely that subjects would participate in the research, then the data will remain confidential.  \n",
      "\n",
      "9. For research collaborations, any open access arrangements can only take place with the agreement of all research partners.  \n",
      "\n",
      "10. Where retention is not specified as a condition of funding, data storage and disposal will be determined by the nature of the research activity and would normally be retained for a period of at least 10 years for non clinical and at least 20 years for all clinical based activities from the date of any publication which is based upon it, as specified in the QMUL Records Retention schedule.  \n",
      "\n",
      "11. Protocols for research in which data will be generated or reused should include data management plans that explicitly address data capture, management, integrity, confidentiality, retention, sharing and publication. These plans will be retained by QMUL to guide future management of the data.   \n",
      "12. The Principal Investigator, or most senior QMUL researcher, in a research project, has responsibility for ensuring that research data management requirements are observed during a research project or programme that they are undertaking.   \n",
      "13. Those responsible for research staff and students should ensure that researchers in their areas are aware of this policy and any associated guidelines and procedures.   \n",
      "14. All researchers are expected to familiarise themselves with and act in accordance with this and other QMUL policies relating to research practice. This information will be made accessible from the QMUL research webpages, both external and internal.   \n",
      "15. QMUL will provide advice, training and support regarding research data management.   \n",
      "16. The Research Data Management Group will set up and manage the necessary resources for the implementation of this policy.   \n",
      "17. Any queries on the application of this policy should be directed to the VicePrincipal (Research).   \n",
      "18. Appeals against the withholding of data may be made in writing to the VicePrincipal (Research), who will review the case from the researcher or their representative for withholding data, and the appeal case, in the light of this policy and other relevant policies, and make a final decision.\n",
      "Preface  \n",
      "\n",
      "The QuTech Research Data Management Policy is part of the central TU Delft Research Data Framework Policy (which outlines the roles of the Library, ICT Department, University Services and the Executive Board at TU Delft).1 This policy helps create effective practices for working with research data at the research institute, and defines data management roles and responsibilities of the different stakeholders within QuTech from the 1st of April 2022 onwards.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The principles outlined in this policy are elaborated in more detail, with supporting information available in the online guidance.  \n",
      "\n",
      "This policy is motivated by the belief that good data management is an essential research skill, leads to research that is more time- and cost-efficient as it prevents data and information loss and duplication of efforts and is required to guarantee the quality, reproducibility and impact of research. This policy is inspired by the FAIR principles: research data should be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) by archiving the data with proper documentation.  \n",
      "\n",
      "This policy cultivates:  \n",
      "\n",
      "Best practice for ensuring that scientific arguments and results are reproducible in the long term.   \n",
      "Better exposure of academic work of researchers at QuTech and TU Delft leading to recognition of the quality of the research process.   \n",
      "Responsible management of research data, including the protection of intellectual property rights and export control of data   \n",
      "Improved practices for meeting the demands of funders and publishers with respect to research data management and sharing.   \n",
      "Long term preservation of the data underlying publications for future researchers within and outside the research group. This cannot be guaranteed by publishing the data in supplementary materials or by only making the data available upon request.  \n",
      "\n",
      "This policy recognises that:  \n",
      "\n",
      "Individual divisions and research groups have different working practices and processes and will therefore require dedicated guidelines.   \n",
      "Research Data Management covers the entire process of managing research data from its creation to its re-use and preservation, which is not equal to Open Science. While it is beneficial to publish research data openly, there might be valid ethical, legal, security or commercial implications, which will make data unsuitable for open sharing.   \n",
      "Research data is the evidence that underpins answers to research questions, and which is necessary to validate research findings, and includes but is not limited to measurement data, source code, algorithms, simulations and models and other forms of information supporting traditional publications.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The term raw data is not always uniquely defined. Moreover, this policy recognizes that not necessarily all binary data generated (e.g., by a physical measurement or simulation run) is or was useful for scientific studies or was accessible to the researcher. Therefore, in this policy the term raw data should be interpreted as a sufficient set of data necessary to fully verify and/or replicate the experimental, theoretical or computational results presented as research findings. There is a limit on the amount of information on reproducing research data that is possible to convey by publishing data, and there always remains know-how and expertise (e.g. operating measurements, sample preparation, etc) which is not easy to document and is not usually made public. Some researchers of QuTech are also affiliated with faculties of TU Delft with their own research data policy. If a policy point is not noted here, they should follow the research data policy of their faculty, but otherwise the most stringent requirement needs to be followed.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The key points of this policy are:  \n",
      "\n",
      "All individuals involved in research follow the research data management strategy of QuTech and their research group.   \n",
      "All individuals involved in research attend data management training when required or needed.   \n",
      "Research data and code needed to reproduce research findings are appropriately documented, stored and shared in a suitable repository. More specifically, the raw and derived data, as well as software scripts used for the full data processing chain, that produce the final figures or tables of a research article are to be published in a trusted data repository (e.g. 4TU.ResearchData or Zenodo.org)   \n",
      "Data Stewards can assist researchers in these activities.\n",

The definitions of these requirements are based on the common definitions of the FAIR principles (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable). These can be found in the influential paper by Wilkinson and colleagues (2016)1 and on the GO FAIR initiative website2. An explanation of FAIR can also be found on Radboud University’s RDM website.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Findability means that research data can be found in a simple, unambiguous and sustainable manner, both within and outside the organisation, also by persons other than the researcher him or herself. Internal findability refers to the idea that data can be found by colleagues, for instance, and that data can be found for the purpose of gathering management information on RDM and research output. External findability refers to the idea that data can be found by peers who are interested in research data associated with a publication, for instance, and that datasets can be found by search engines. This is made possible in the following way:  \n",
      "\n",
      "Datasets are assigned a persistent identifier (PID). A PID is a permanent and unique reference that is independent of the data storage location. A well-known example of a PID is a DOI (Digital Object Identifier).   \n",
      "Data are accompanied by rich metadata. Metadata is defined as the data that describe the properties of data or a dataset, e.g., title, author, date, descriptive notes and applicable access restrictions. Comprehensive and detailed metadata enhance the findability of a dataset. Rich metadata also include descriptions of the context, content and properties of the data, as part of the documentation of a dataset.   \n",
      "The PID of the dataset is part of the metadata that describe the data.   \n",
      "Data and/or metadata are registered or indexed in a searchable information source. Th registration or indexing makes it possible to find the chosen archive and its subsequent content via common search engines such as Google Scholar.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Accessibility is not about making research data accessible to everyone at all times, but about the proper regulation and registration of the conditions under which it is possible to access the data and how this can be done (effective access management). This is made possible in the following way:  \n",
      "\n",
      "Access to data and/or metadata is regulated through a standardised protocol and, if necessary, an access procedure is also used.   \n",
      "The metadata are preserved, even when the full dataset is no longer available.3 This makes it possible to find researchers, organisations and publications that relate to the original research, even at a later date.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Radboud University seeks to ensure the interoperability and reusability of research data. However, these are not current requirements in Radboud University’s RDM policy. Interoperability requires that data can be interpreted and combined, both by people and through automation. Reusability requires that data and metadata are accompanied by explanatory information and that they are accurately described to the point that it is possible to reuse, replicate and combine the data in different contexts and situations.\n",

      "2. The RWTH supports free access to research data. Researchers are, however, not obliged to make data accessible to persons outside of the project team before processing, evaluating and publishing their research. Exceptions are disclosures to commissions. Contractual agreements also remain unaffected.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The management of research data includes planning, gathering, processing and storing of the data. It guarantees the access, reuse, reproducibility and quality assurance of all research data that are forming the basis of scientific results.\n",

      "4. The project manager as well as researchers researching on their own responsibility are generally responsible for managing the research data of their research projects. In particular, they are obliged to guarantee the adherence to proven academic research practices as well as the standards of their subject area. All persons involved in a research project are responsible for the correctness of the data they gathered and the compliance to the regulations they agreed upon.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Research projects with research data require a data management plan which states the research data’s access rights and exceptions.\n",

      "Recommendations for the opening of research data within the Sorbonne University Alliance\n",
      "\n",
      "To implement the policy of opening up research data, the institutions of the Sorbonne University Alliance have set themselves the following objectives:\n",
      "\n",
      "to raise awareness of open data among research staff in different communities and disciplines and promote the dissemination of good practice;\n",
      "to advise them on compliance with contractual requirements requested by funding agencies, drafting of data management plans, storage/archiving solutions and their cost, allocation of identifiers, and data curation, including for sensitive data;\n",
      "to work to facilitate the exchange of data and metadata between information systems according to the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this perspective of opening up and sharing data, the members of the Sorbonne University Alliance recommend setting up a Research Data Helpdesk  in the form of a portal for access to available resources, making it possible in particular:\n",
      "\n",
      "to identify and promote standards, infrastructure, software and IT services for data storage, access and analysis;\n",
      "to direct users to repositories where data can be deposited and described;\n",
      "to put users in touch with experts on technical, legal or innovation-related issues;\n",
      "to ensure pre-publication referencing of datasets;\n",
      "and to promote and use tools and services that support collaboration.\n",
      "\n",
      "It will be up to the institutions of the Sorbonne University Alliance to co-lead a working group for the construction, steering and management of this helpdesk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each institution will be able to integrate the services of this helpdesk into its own technical environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "A sharing of resources is clearly desirable and beneficial, subject to prior agreement between the partners concerned.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the longer term, this helpdesk should also :\n",
      "\n",
      "allow secure access to sensitive or confidential data;\n",
      "support the management of 'long tail' data from disciplines that do not have their own research data management infrastructure;\n",
      "propose a solution to link researchers, publications, organisations and funding to the whole output, so as to provide opportunities for 'research in context'.\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to implement the proposed recommendations and come up with operational solutions, staff and financial resources will be needed in each of the institutions of the Sorbonne University Alliance.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the initial funding that may be obtained with the PIA allocation, the institutions of the Sorbonne University Alliance undertake to :\n",
      "\n",
      "respond to regional, national or international calls for projects concerning the opening up of data, either individually or jointly, with the institutions keeping each other informed of any responses to calls for projects that they may make individually;\n",

      "Policy\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Staffordshire University recognises the importance of establishing appropriate systems, policies and processes to govern the ways in which research data generated as part of the University’s research activity are managed.\n",
      "2. This policy applies to all those undertaking research (including staff and postgraduate researchers) and those managing and supporting research; and to all research, whether externally funded or not.\n",
      "3. This policy requires that all those undertaking research store unpublished University research data within Microsoft SharePoint through a Microsoft Teams Team1.\n",
      "4. It is the responsibility of the principal investigator of the research study to ensure the data for their studies is stored according to this policy. It is assumed that research data obtained will be digital, or can be digitised and then stored according to this policy. It is expected that only in very rare cases will it be impossible to digitise the data, in which case the principal investigator should make this clear on the Ethics application, and furthermore make clear how the data will be stored. The principal investigator should further ensure that personal data is stored as required by the University’s Code of Conduct for Research and Research Integrity, and Annex 1 to that code, the ‘Framework for Good Research Practice’2; furthermore, a separate Teams channel, or private channel, should be used for personal data. Personalised data and anonymised data should be stored in separate locations. The principal investigator is the named lead researcher at Staffordshire University responsible for delivery of the research, or the component of research assigned to the University. The principal investigator must describe in the study protocol (or within the research methodology) the name of the Microsoft Teams Team that will be used to store the data, who will have access to the data and what Microsoft Team authority they will have (member or owner). Where named individuals are known, this should be given. In roles that are not yet occupied, the role title should be used. It is the responsibility of all researchers who have access to the data to comply with this policy for all research data that they process. If the ‘raw’ data is not immediately stored on Teams but is captured on a separate device, the data should be uploaded to Teams as soon as is practicable, which must be within two weeks. If it is known before the research starts that this time scale will not be met, this should be made clear on the Ethics application. Before data is transferred, it is the responsibility of the individual to ensure that it is secured according to the legal standards to which this policy adheres and to Staffordshire University IT regulations (  In the case of postgraduate research students, it is the responsibility of both the student and their supervisor to ensure that their research data is stored in accordance with this policy.\n",
      "5. If the principal investigator leaves the University, they must inform their line manager and their School’s Associate Dean for Research and Innovation of the name, description and location of the data. If the research study is still ongoing, a new principal investigator will be assigned, and they will assume responsibility for the research data. In the event that the research study has concluded, or that no one else remains employed at the University, the Associate Dean for Research and Innovation of the School in which the original principal investigator worked will assume responsibility until the data has exceeded its retention period.\n",
      "6. In the event that Staffordshire University is not the lead research organisation, it is recognised that data may need to be transferred and/or stored according to other University’s policy and procedure. Where another organisation’s policy and procedure is put in place, the Staffordshire University (via the principal investigator and copying in dataprotection@staffs.ac.uk) should be notified in writing.\n",
      "7. It is acknowledged that some research data may not be transferred to the University in order to be compliant with legislation. Where this is the case, it should be clearly stated in the study protocol, or within the research methodology before any research activity commences and should be clearly stated in any ethics application documentation.\n",
      "8. When creating a ‘Team’ to store research, a separate site should be created for each research project. This enables appropriate levels of access and control to be applied to each project, and simplifies compliance with any legal, contractual or regulatory requirements.\n",
      "9. When creating a Teams site: The site must be given a meaningful name and include the reference number from the ethics application. If the title contains the word “Research” then a default data retention policy is applied to the team site to preserve all files stored on the “File” tab for 3 years. Privacy levels must be set to “Private – only team owners can add members”. This restricts access to just the individuals that have been authorised by the owner of the site. Site owners should undertake at appropriate intervals reviews of who has access to the site, and remove access from individuals or add access to individuals as appropriate.\n",
      "10. To allow researchers to retain data for a specified period of time, Staffordshire University has implemented a policy that detects key words within SharePoint sites’ description and\n",
      "\n",
      "applies corresponding data protection policies.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the keywords “Hold1”, “Hold2”, … , “Hold10” are added to a SharePoint site’s description then data on the site is retained for the corresponding number of years (i.e. 1, 2,…10 years) after it was last modified.\n",
      "\n",
      "If a greater retention period is required, then Digital Services should be contacted to add a custom retention hold to the site.\n",
      "\n",
      "11. Similarly, it may be required to delete data after a specified period. The keywords “Delete1”, “Delete2”, …., “Delete10” can be added to a site to delete data a specified number of years after it was last modified.\n",
      "\n",
      "12. Holds and deletes are calculated for each individual file based on its last modification date.\n",
      "\n",
      "13. If both “Hold” and “Delete” policies apply to a site, then both processes will take effect. If the retention hold is greater than the delete then files will not be deleted until after the hold period.\n",
      "\n",
      "14. Note that if required, a researcher can check what hold/delete policies are applicable to their sites by using  SharePoint search functionality at   Searching for e.g. “description:hold5” would list sites with a five year retention period.\n",
      "\n",
      "15. Researchers who are intending to collect and store highly sensitive/confidential research data should discuss with Digital Services how such data can be protected.\n",
      "\n",
      "16. This could include:\n",
      "\n",
      "Requiring Multi-factor authentication in order to access a team site. This protects from phished/stolen credentials being used to access a site\n",
      "Requiring use of a University managed computer to access a team site. This protects phished/stolen credentials being used to access a site, and makes it more difficult to extract data from a site.\n",
      "Preventing file download from non-university managed computers, but providing a web edit view to authorised users to allow controlled viewing and editing of files. This make it more difficult to extract data from a site, or for ransomware/malware to be\n",

The agreements shall specify the data management responsibilities as well as whether and how the data is to be stored and made accessible and which respective party is responsible for archiving and making data accessible. If ownership is agreed upon, it does not mean that a party owns the data but rather that the party has rights and obligations towards the other parties within the project/study that usually come with ownership (such as the right to use the data in further research or commercially, the right to publish, and archive them, etc.). Confidentiality can also be agreed upon but then binds no one other than the contracting parties. The principle of public access to official documents cannot be waived, and should there be no basis for confidentiality according to the Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act23 then the data must be disclosed upon request. To the extent that a funder imposes requirements on how data within a project or study should be stored and made openly available, the funder's requirements shall be followed, provided that Swedish legislation is complied with. Should data belong to another organisation, such as a private company or a public authority in another country, access may be restricted or blocked. In such cases, it is important that an agreement governs the accessibility and availability of data during the project.\n",

Data together with associated metadata and potential other documentation must be stored in a secure manner. They shall be protected from unauthorised access and loss, independent of whether or not the data are to be made publicly accessible. Computers and storage media that are not regularly backed up shall not be used for primary data storage in research projects and environmental monitoring and assessment studies. In order to be able to use a cloud service for storing personal data, there must be a data processing agreement with the supplier of the service.

      "\n",
      "One way to make data accessible for reuse is to upload and describe data files in, preferably certified, data catalogues (repositories) where data is accessible via the web35. Data generated at SLU should, as far as possible, be made openly accessible in data catalogues that provide data with a persistent identifier (PID) 36 in order to, among other things, facilitate proper citation of data. So as to comply with the FAIR data sharing principles, SLU offers support in reviewing and improving metadata and data when making it accessible and depositing, both in data catalogues37 and other commonly existing solutions utilised in research as well as environmental monitoring and assessment at SLU.\n",
      "\n",
      "In data catalogues, the data licence can often be specified in the metadata. By means of licences users become aware of the purposes for which data may be used and the conditions for further sharing. Licensing is an important component of meeting the FAIR data sharing principles. However, principles for licensing data by SLU are not included in this version of the policy due to ongoing national discussions on this issue.\n",

      "Data must be made available according to the principle \"as early as possible, as late as necessary\", based on the conditions of the project or study. Within environmental monitoring and assessment, each study must consider when it is appropriate to make data available, since much data collection continues over time without a cut-off date. Even in time-limited projects, especially should such run over a longer period of time, reasons may exist to make subsets of data accessible already during the course of the project.\n",

      "Research and environmental monitoring and assessment data generated at SLU are considered official documents and are subject to the constitutional principle of public access to official records38. Thus, data must be, as a rule, released upon request and preserved in SLU's archives. Copyright applies to the results of research recorded in a work (e.g., a scientific publication). Primary data must be archived and preserved in order to make such research results verifiable. Laws and regulations govern whether confidentiality can be invoked or whether documents can be disposed of after a certain time.39 Archiving of research and environmental monitoring and assessment data requires that the data is well documented, reliable, and readable. The archiving requirements are in many ways consistent with what is needed for information security and making data accessible, yet preserving documents is not the same as storing or making data accessible. Prior to and during projects and studies that generate data, those responsible must decide what applies to, for example, confidentiality and disposal deadlines, preferably in a data management plan. Data must be archived at the latest at the end of a project or study.\n",

      "6.1 Staff engaged in research and environmental monitoring and assessment The person responsible for a study always has primary responsibility for his or her own activities and must ensure that good research practice, current legislation, and established procedures are followed. This responsibility also includes good and appropriate data management. Should a student carry out an independent project within the framework of an ongoing research project, the project manager of the research project is responsible for the necessary management of collected data.40\n",

In most cases, it is appropriate for the project’s Project Manager (PI) or equivalent to be the data controller, however the role may also be assigned to someone else. Though, the data controller shall be distinguished from the person responsible for the data-managing infrastructure. The data controller has overall responsibility for the management of data within a project or study (as defined below) but not necessarily for the technology or infrastructure deployed in the process.\n",

      "\n",
      "Should the data controller leave SLU or is unable to fulfil his/her duties for any other reason, formal responsibility is transferred to the head of the department where the project is based, unless another person is appointed. Should data from research or environmental monitoring and assessment be handed over to another part of SLU, responsibility is transferred to that part of the organisation. A researcher, or a person engaged in environmental monitoring and assessment, who terminates his/her employment at the University is responsible for handing over the data is to the department for further use and subsequent archiving at the latest at the end of his/her employment, as well as for maintaining a dialogue with the support functions regarding making the data accessible. Data produced as part of projects or studies conducted at SLU must be kept at the University, even if the responsible personnel change their place of work.\n",

      "1.\t The planning and execution of a research project also include research data management. This concerns, for example, the type of data generated and used in the course of the project, information on the required accuracy and scope of the data and metadata to be collected, measures to maintain the integrity and authenticity of the data, as well as information on confidentiality, retention and planned publication, including clarification of intellectual property rights and rights of use. These aspects should be systematically prepared and recorded in a suitable form (data management plan). Subject-specific characteristics and standards must be taken into account and the data management plan must be adapted in line with the current progress of the project.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.\t The leaders of a research project are responsible for the management of all resulting research data during its entire duration. In consultation with the researchers involved, they decide on the selection of research data to be archived and the time, place and conditions of its archiving and, if applicable, its publication. In particular, all project participants are obliged to ensure compliance with good scientific practice and long-term archiving, as well as to implement the relevant requirements of the research funders and partners. In doing so, they take ethical, data protection and copyright aspects into account.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Research data must be archived to the extent and for the periods specified in the Guidelines for Safeguarding Good Scientific Practice (usually at least ten years). As a rule, this archiving should take place in a recognized discipline-specific research data repository1 or in the institutional repository of TUDa (TUdatalib2). If there are reasons why archiving at the above-mentioned locations is not possible, an archiving solution should be chosen that ensures a similar level of long-term integrity preservation, accessibility and findability of the data. If the data volume of the research data to be stored is too high for complete archiving, a selection will be made according to the aspects of traceability, reproducibility and reusability.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. In order to ensure the traceability and reproducibility of research results, research data should be published at an appropriate time and to an appropriate extent, unless other regulations (e.g. contracts in commissioned research or data protection law) or a planned commercial exploitation prevent this. In order to ensure their reusability and in accordance with the Open Access Policy of the TU Darmstadt,3 published research data should be assigned as open a license as possible. To implement the FAIR principles, the metadata describing the research data must be published to an appropriate extent.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.\t The source code of self-developed research software, which was created at the TU Darmstadt, shall be made publicly available, provided that the research data generated with it can only be understood with it and no other reasons contradict a publication.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. All research groups at TUDa strive to be up to date with regard to the rules, standards and recommendations for research data management that apply to their discipline. To this end, they appoint a scientific staff member as RDM officer who actively follows developments and supports the group members in research data management. The development of subjet-specific recommendations at the appropriate level (departments, institutes, etc.) is recommended.\n",
      "\n",
      "An RDM officer can also be appointed for several methodologically or disciplinary related disciplines. The RDM officers exchange information with each other at the appropriate level (at least in the department). TUdata supports the RDM officers and their networking.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. When applying for external funding, the departments check what effort research data management will require in the project and what opportunities exist to raise corresponding funds from the funding agency.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Data literacy is a prerequisite for efficient and sustainable handling of research data and for compliance with good scientific practice. The methods of subject-specific research data management should therefore be appropriately anchored in teaching and continuing education. Due to the outstanding importance of today’s students for tomorrow’s science, the TU Darmstadt advocates the idea of “good research data management from the very beginning” and, in addition to teaching the theoretical basics at an early stage, strives for the continuous and practical application of the methods and tools in student internships and thesis projects.\n",

      "\n",
      "TU Wien recognizes the fundamental importance of research data1  and the management of research data and records in maintaining quality research and scientific integrity and is committed to state-of-the-art handling and management of research data. RDM policies are highly valuable to current and future researchers2.\n",
      "\n",
      "TU Wien acknowledges that correct and easily retrievable research data are the foundation of and integral to research. They are necessary to verify and defend the process and results of research. Research data have a long-term value for research and academia, with the potential for widespread use in society.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2 Scope\n",
      "\n",
      "This policy for the management of research data applies to all researchers active at TU Wien. The policy was approved by the Rectorate on 03.07.2018. In cases when research is funded by a third party3, any agreements made with that party concerning intellectual property rights (IPR), access rights, exploitation rights and the storage of research data take precedence over this policy.\n",

Research data include all materials created in the course of academic work, e.g. through digitisation, records, source research, experiments, measurements, surveys and interviews. This includes software and code.\n",
      "\n",
      "Research data management spans the entire life cycle of the research data: their planning, generation, analysis, evaluation, archiving, publication and eventual reuse by third parties. Besides documenting the research data, RDM includes specifying – and possibly storing – the equipment and software employed in producing them. Metadata4 should be captured together with the research data during the research process, since they facilitate the identification, interpretation and reuse of research data.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5 Handling research data\n",
      "\n",
      "Research data should from the beginning be stored and maintained in appropriate systems and made available for use in a suitable repository (see 6.1. b). Research data must be provided with persistent identifiers5 within the repository.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is important to preserve the integrity of research data and to comply with the FAIR principles.6 Research data must be stored in a correct, complete, unadulterated, and reliable manner.

      "Research data and records are to be stored and made available in accordance with intellectual property laws or the requirements of third-party funders as well as applicable legal or contractual requirements (e.g. EU restrictions on where identifiable personal data may be stored). Research data that may be of future historical interest and the records accompanying them should also be archived.\n",
      "\n",
      "The minimum retention period for research data and records is 10 years after either the assignment of a persistent identifier or the publication of a related work following research completion, whichever is later.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the event that research data and records are to be deleted or destroyed, either after expiration of the required retention period or for legal or ethical reasons, such action is to be carried out only after consideration of all legal and ethical perspectives. The following aspects must be taken into consideration when decisions are made about the retention or destruction of research data: interests and contractual provisions of third-party funders and other stakeholders, employees, and partner participants in particular, as well as confidentiality and security. Any decision taken must be documented.\n",

      "This policy will be reviewed and updated as required by the Rectorate of TU Wien every three years. In case of legal or regulatory changes, the review of this policy can take place at an earlier point in time.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Annex\n",
      "Definition\n",
      "\n",
      "1.1. Research is any creative work undertaken on a systematic basis in order to increase the stock of knowledge, including knowledge of man, culture and society, and the use of this stock of knowledge to devise new applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.2. Researchers are all members of TU Wien, specifically employees and doctoral candidates, who conduct research. Persons not directly affiliated to TU Wien who are conducting research on TU Wien premises or using TU Wien facilities are also included in the term. Visiting researchers or collaborators are also expected to comply with the policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.3. Third parties are natural or legal persons, public authorities, institutions or other entities that are not affiliated to TU Wien.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.4. Research data refer to all information (regardless of form or presentation) needed to support or validate the development, results, observations or findings of research work, including contextual information. Research data include all materials created in the course of academic work, e.g. through digitisation, records, source research, experiments, measurements, surveys and interviews. This includes software and code. Research data can be classified as\n",
      "\n",
      "raw or primary data: information recorded as notes, images, video footage, paper surveys, computer files etc., processed data: analyses, descriptions and conclusions in the form of reports or papers, and published data: information distributed to others than those involved in data acquisition and administration.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.5. Metadata is descriptive or contextual information associated with publications and research data to assist in their identification, location and retrieval by users, while facilitating content and access management. Metadata usually takes the form of a structured set of elements.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.6. Persistent identifiers are identifiers attached to publications and research data that make them easier to link to and find. They must be unique and remain associated with the correct version of the publication or research data. Ideally, they provide access to digital objects through a resolver service, as digital object identifiers (DOIs) and handles do.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.7. The FAIR principles provide a framework to ensure that research data can be effectively reused. FAIR stands for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.8. Data management plans (DMPs) are living documents that describe how research data will be managed during their life cycle. DMPs should state what research data will be created and how, as well as outlining plans for sharing and preserving them. Any restrictions on access to research data should be noted along with mechanisms to protect unauthorised access. In the event that research data and records are to be deleted or destroyed, the DMP should specify the person(s) responsible for taking and carrying out that decision, the storage location of the deletion process documentation, the person(s) responsible for preserving this documentation and the basis of the decision. Ideally, DMPs should be delivered in a machine-actionable format.\n",
      "Glossary\n",
      "\n",
      "Contract research is scientific research carried out on behalf of a private or public funding organization. The task is predefined and the rights to the research results generally belong to the principal, whereby the University is granted a non-exclusive right of use for the purpose of research and teaching.\n",
      "\n",
      "A data management plan (DMP) is a structured guideline on how to handle research data both during and after a research project. It documents the process how the research data is generated and how it is stored appropriately so that it can be interpreted and verified, and remains available, authentic, citable, and reusable in later years. To this end, clearly defined legal parameters and appropriate security measures (such as contracts and licenses) shall also be included in the DMP. To optimize research data management and as a basis for institutional support, a DMP should be created before the start of a research project and updated in the course of the project.\n",
      "\n",
      "A repository is a storage platform for the archiving and worldwide publication of scientific publications, research data, or cultural heritage data. Storage of research results in a repository ensures that they are sustainably accessible, verifiable, citable, and reusable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The FAIR principles are international principles for sustainably reusable research data. The main objective of the principles is to ensure that research data is optimally prepared so that it is findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. The FAIR principles were created and first published in 2016 by a broad-based interest group consisting of representatives from science, industry, funding organizations, and scientific publishers.9\n",
      "\n",
      "Researchers include all members of TU Berlin active in research including employees and doctoral candidates. People who are not directly connected with TU Berlin but use its infrastructure or are physically present at the University for research purposes are included in this term. Visiting researchers and external cooperative partners are expected to comply with the Research Data Policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Research Data Management (RDM) encompasses all measures for the quality assurance of research data with regard to storage, access, and preservation of research data in order to make research results sustainably reproducible and available for reuse. The activities cover the entire research data lifecycle, starting with the planning and execution of the research project, through the creation and storing of data to the long-term storage of the results after the research project is completed. Specific tasks in RDM include quality control and quality assurance, documentation, metadata creation, archiving, data exchange and reuse as well as measures for data integrity and data security.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cooperative research is cooperation on equal terms between partners pursuing a common goal. In principle, the rights to the results belong to the partner who developed them.\n",
      "\n",
      "A licence for free use (or free license) is a standardized license agreement which allows research data to be reused. It regulates which rights of use the author/originator grants to the general public that go beyond the applicable copyright law. Depending on the data type, a license is selected. Established free licenses in software are the GNU General Public License (GPL), the MIT license, or the Apache license. Creative Common licenses (CC) apply to texts, images, music and videos.\n",
      "\n",
      "Metadata is data about data. It is data which provides descriptive or contextual information about other data, can be indexed, and facilitates archiving and retrieval. There are different types or categories of metadata. Metadata in a repository, for example, can be classified in four types of content: bibliographic metadata (e.g. title, author, abstract), structural metadata (relationships between and within objects, e.g. links, references), administrative metadata (authorizations/status, e.g. access rights, embargo), technical metadata (data evaluated by the system, e.g. size of files, checksums, modification date).\n",
      "\n",
      "A persistent identifier is a constant Internet address for digital objects. It guarantees that a dataset remains permanently findable, accessible, and citable, even if its physical location changes. Well known examples are DOI (digital object identifier) or URN (uniform resource name).\n",
      "Definitions\n",
      "\n",
      "Research is any creative and systematically performed work with the goal of furthering knowledge, including discoveries regarding people, culture and society, in addition to the use of such knowledge for new applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.2 Researchers refers to all research-active members of an institution including employees and doctoral candidates. Persons not directly affiliated with an institution, but who, for purposes of research, make use of or are physically present at the institution, are also included in the term. Visiting researchers or collaborators may also be expected to comply with the policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.3 Research data refers to all information (independent of form or presentation) needed to support or validate the development, results, observations or findings of a research project, including contextual information. Research data include all materials which are created in the course of academic work, including digitisation, records, source research, experiments, measurements, surveys and interviews. This includes software and code. Research data can take on several forms during the lifespan of a research project. Data can exist as gradations of raw data, processed data (including negative and inconclusive results), published data and Open Access published data, and with varying levels of access, including open data, restricted data and closed data.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4 Planning\n",
      "\n",
      "All new research projects should include a research data management plan (DMP) which details approaches to the capture, management, integrity, confidentiality, retention, ownership, sharing and publication of research data. Compliance with relevant legal and ethical frameworks and funder requirements where relevant should be ensured.  A DMP must be developed where specified by a funder, sponsor or other relevant stakeholder, and is strongly encouraged as best practice for all projects.\n",
      "\n",
      "The University provides access to an online tool3 which can be used to create Data Management Plans if another tool, such as one provided by a funder, is not being used.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 5 Storage and Management\n",
      "\n",
      "Research data should be stored and made available for use in a suitable repository or archiving system and provided with persistent identifiers. Research data should be stored on the University’s research data repository4, or a record should be created in the repository with a link to a suitable external repository, for example if it is felt that an external discipline-specific policy would give a dataset enhanced visibility or when the use of an external repository is required by an external funder.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.2 It is important to preserve the integrity of research data and they must be stored in a correct reliable manner. Data storage should follow FAIR data principles5 and must be identifiable, accessible, traceable, interoperable, and whenever possible, available for subsequent use.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.3 Non-digital research data should be stored in a form that would allow for sharing and access if required. The fact that research data is non-digital does not provide a sufficient reason for restricting access.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.4 Research data must be assigned a licence for open use, in compliance with intellectual property rights, if no third-party rights, legal requirements or property laws prohibit it.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 6 Retention\n",
      "\n",
      "Research data and records are to be stored and made available in accordance with the research data management plan, relevant\n",
      "\n",
      "intellectual property laws, and/or the requirements of third-party funders, within the parameters of applicable legal or contractual requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "6.2 The minimum archive duration for research data and records should be determined by best practice, discipline norms and stakeholder requirements where relevant.  In the absence of these, a general guideline is that data should be retained for 10 years after either the assignment of a persistent identifier or publication of related research results, whichever is later.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 7 Disposal\n",
      "\n",
      "Research data should be disposed of securely, in accordance with the DMP and the University’s Information Security Policy.  The timing of data disposal should reflect any ethical, contractual and legal requirements, and current best practice.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Responsibilities, rights and duties\n",
      "\n",
      "8.1 Researchers are responsible for:\n",

      "\n",
      "This policy defines the standards that govern the management of research data at the Open University.\n",
      "\n",
      "Research data management (RDM) is a recognised part of the research process and scholarly communications. Formal requirements and expectations from funders, publishers, collaborators and institutions (for example Data Management Plans and data sharing) exist and are likely to continue to evolve. There are benefits to the researcher, the University and the research community when research data is well managed, preserved and, where appropriate, made publicly available.\n",

      "# Policy\n",
      "Research data management\n",
      "\n",
      "10. Responsibility for research data management during any research project lies jointly with Principal Investigators (PIs) and researcher(s).\n",
      "\n",
      "11. Published research papers should include a short statement describing how and on what terms any supporting research data may be accessed.\n",
      "\n",
      "12. There is a presumption of open access to data held in a University or other public repository. However, access may be restricted, subject to a time embargo or not permitted for legal (i.e. intellectual property, data protection, confidentiality, contractual requirements), ethical or commercial reasons.\n",
      "\n",
      "13. At all stages of the research process, researchers are responsible for adherence to ethical principles, conditions of ethical or regulatory approvals, research governance requirements or legal agreements, such as terms of use set by providers of datasets.\n",
      "\n",
      "14. Researchers are expected to abide by the principles of information governance and to undertake training where required. Researchers are responsible for compliance with the requirements of the Data Protection Act 1998 and for the creation of metadata and other documentation that enables data to be discoverable, understandable and re-useable.\n",
      "15. RCUK accept that research data management is a valid cost for research proposals. Principal Investigators should ensure that research data management requirements are costed into research proposals for all RCUK proposals and for other funders where allowable.\n",
      "16. To allow for institutional planning on infrastructure and research support, and the validation of existence of appropriate plans to support monitoring of compliance with funder requirements, all research proposals must include research data management plans that address the capture, management, integrity, confidentiality, security, selection, preservation and disposal, commercialisation, costs, sharing and publication of research data and the production of descriptive metadata to aid discovery and re-use when relevant. These should be stored in a sensible and accessible location, ideally alongside other project documentation.\n",
      "17. Data should be actively managed by researchers throughout the project, by following and updating the data management plan with ongoing decisions regarding retention and destruction.\n",
      "18. When research is complete, researchers are responsible for ensuring that research data (including websites) of long term value, or data required by funders or the University, are considered for retention, preservation and curation by offering such data for assessment, deposit and preservation in an appropriate University, national or international data service or domain repository, unless specified otherwise in the data management plan.\n",
      "19. The University is responsible for ensuring safe storage of this data and is responsible for curation of this data in particular instances (i.e. health/social care research and clinical trials) where the University is sponsoring a study and agrees to take responsibility for archiving data.\n",
      "20. All research data selected for retention should be registered with the University’s data repository, even if the data is retained in a national or international data service or domain repository or if the data is not suitable for publishing on Open Access.\n",
      "21. Data selected for retention should not be deposited with any organisation that does not commit to its access and availability for re-use, unless this is a condition of funding or would prevent commercial interests.\n",
      "22. After the deposit of data with a repository, the repository is responsible for the on-going management of that data in accordance with legal, technical and other requirements. However, researchers should ensure that they are satisfied with the sustainability of the repository.\n",
      "23. The University is responsible for the provision of sustainable, secure solutions that meet the requirements for long term data storage, discovery and re-use as set out in these principles.\n",
      "4.2 Research data management procedure\n",
      "\n",
      "At the start of every funded project, the researcher or lead researcher if part of a group will produce a DMP in line with the funder's specific requirements, or if no requirements are specified by the funder, then in accordance with the good practice described by DMP Online.\n",
      "\n",
      "DMPs should cover data types and volume, capture, storage, integrity, confidentiality, retention and destruction, sharing and deposit. A suggested minimum period of retention is ten years from the end of the project, however requirements by funders and data providers, as well as disciplinary guidance should be observed.\n",
      "\n",
      "DMPs must specify how and when research data will be made available for access and reuse.  Underpinning research data should be made available as soon as findings are published, under appropriate safeguards when necessary.  Academics may choose to have six months (STEM)/12 month (HAS) embargo period applied to the data.  A risk assessment is required whenever data pertaining to individuals is used. This must be approved by the relevant Research Ethical Committee prior to research commencing. Research outputs that convey findings from research data must include a data access statement that clearly provides directions for readers to obtain the data or a statement as to why the data is not available (e.g., commercial sensitivity).\n",
      "\n",
      "Costs such as extra storage, long-term retention, or data management effort must be addressed and included in costings to funders whose policies accept RDM costs. Note - All UK Research and Innovation funders explicitly state that all costs associated with research data management are eligible under UKRI funding.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Principal Investigator/Researcher will be responsible for ensuring that the actions outlined in the DMP are carried out.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of a project data will be deposited in the university's secure central storage solution.  Complete datasets are to be uploaded to the Universities current research information system (Pure) to enable the research support team to deposit this in the university’s secure storage solution (Arkivum). The data must include appropriate\n",
      "\n",
      "descriptive metadata and, if necessary, accompanying explanatory documentation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Datasets within the university's central storage solution will be subject to review after ten years following date of deposit. The review will be undertaken by the researcher and the Head of Research Support. In the absence of the original researcher, an appropriate academic colleague will conduct the review with the Head of Research Support.\n",
      "\n",
      "If required as a result of the review, data may be securely destroyed or kept for a further ten-year period.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.2 Rights to use and access research data\n",
      "\n",
      "In determining access rights for research data, the legitimate interests of the subjects of research data must be protected. The rights of the public to access publicly funded research should also be considered. When open access to datasets is not legal or ethical, information governance restrictions on access and use must be applied as necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Written agreements are required when personal data (any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person) is passed from a data controller to a data processor or another data controller, or to a country not bound by the General Data Protection Regulation or equivalent privacy legislation. Written agreements are also useful when the data being shared although not personal data, are confidential or valuable to the parties involved.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exclusive rights to reuse or publish research data must not be passed to commercial publishers or agents without retaining the rights to make the data openly available for reuse unless this is a condition of funding.\n",
      "Rules and Agreements on Storage, Access, and Archiving\n",
      "\n",
      "### Storage\n",
      "\n",
      "There are countless ways to lose data: a file is accidentally deleted, a laptop is stolen, the context of the data is unclear, software becomes unusable, a file can no longer be opened, etcetera. It is, therefore, important that every researcher pays attention to storing, organizing, and describing his or her data. It is also good to make agreements about this at the level of the School, Department, or Research Institute. The following could be considered:\n",
      "\n",
      "How do you organize the safe collection of research data?\n",
      "Where are data stored for ongoing research?\n",
      "How are data stored?\n",
      "How is it organized that the raw data file cannot be changed after storage?\n",

      "\n",
      "The \"VSNU Code of Conduct for the Use of Personal Data in Scientific Research\" (hereinafter referred to as the \"Code of Conduct for the Use of Personal Data\") is a translation of the GDPR for societal and behavioral science research. This Code of Conduct for the Use of Personal Data gives the researcher a practical assessment framework on how to handle personal data with care. In the Code of Conduct, personal data is defined as any data relating to an identified or identifiable natural person, i.e. any data that, without disproportionate time or effort, can lead to the identification of a natural person. Personal data are either directly identifying (personal) data or not directly identifying (personal) data.\n",

      "Use of Personal Data) Only use lawfully collected data obtained with the consent of the respondent for a research. Exceptions are possible (see Section 3.3 onwards on page 12 of the Code of Conduct for the Use of Personal Data). Collect data sparingly: no more personal data may be collected than is necessary for the research; anonymous data should be used if possible; personal data will only be processed if there is no other option (see Section 3.2 on pages 11–12 and page 25 onwards of the Code of Conduct for the Use of Personal Data). When processing directly identifying data, two files should be created (communication data and research data). Linking takes place via an empty administration number and the access rules for the files must differ (see Section 3.6, page 13 and page 27 of the Code of Conduct for the Use of Personal Data).\n",
      "\n",
      "Personal data must be protected during processing and storage so that unauthorized persons (those not involved in the research) cannot have access to them (see Chapter 4, page 15, page 29, and page 30 of the Code of Conduct for the Use of Personal Data). Publication may only be made if this cannot be traced back to persons.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Transparency: report to the Data Protection Officer and schedule\n",
      "\n",
      "If the research consists of processing data that can be directly or indirectly traced back to a natural person, the researcher must fill in the \"Integrated form for Ethics (if applicable), Data Management and the Data Processing Register”. The form helps to map out the processing operations that will take place for the purpose of the research. The completed schedule should then be sent to the appropriate email address of the School (see the overview of Ethics Review Boards of each School).\n",
      "\n",
      "On the basis of the completed inventory schedule, the Data Protection Officer, if necessary in consultation with Legal Affairs, can advise on compliance with the legal conditions for the protection of personal data and the Code of Conduct. It can also be tested whether further assessment of the security measures by the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) of LIS is desirable.\n",

      "\n",
      "Verifiability is an aspect of ethical research. On this basis, it is justifiable to store the personal data file for a minimum of ten years if this is necessary for verifiability (as stated in article 5 of the Research Data Management Regulation). However, a distinction must be made between direct and indirect identifying data.\n",

      "provides a corporate framework with defined roles and responsibilities for the collection, quality, storage, security, maintenance and dissemination of research data\n",
      "should be read in conjunction with all related policies, regulations and guidance documents (see Annex 1)\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 2 Scope\n",
      "\n",
      "2.1 This policy applies to all members of the University conducting research or involved in the creation, collection or generation of research data.  This shall include, but not be limited to, employed staff, research students, honorary staff, and visiting academics.  This group will be collectively referred to as ‘Researchers’.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.2 The University’s data management policy applies to research data in all its forms irrespective of whether or not the research is funded.  This may include raw data captured from instruments, derived data, documents, spreadsheets & databases, lab notebooks, visualisations, models, software, images, measurements and numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.3  This policy applies to all approved research projects conducted at the University by Researchers regardless of whether they are externally funded or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.4  This policy will be augmented in due course with detailed procedures and guidelines for staff in relation to the management of their research data.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 3 Policy Requirements\n",
      "\n",
      "3.1 Research data must be created, maintained and shared in accordance with contractual, legislative, regulatory, ethical and other relevant requirements at the local, national and international level. Externally-funded researchers must ensure compliance with their funder’s policy on research data management and data publication.  In cases were researchers may be affected by a number of policies, funder policy should take precedence.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.2 All new research proposals [from date of adoption] must include research data management plans or protocols that explicitly address data capture, management, integrity, confidentiality, retention, sharing and publication.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.3 The storage, management and sharing of research data carries a cost, particularly if there is a need for long-term curation and dissemination, requiring the provision of staff and system resources.  Costs for data management and sharing activities should be written into research grant applications, unless explicitly forbidden by the funder.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.4 Responsibility for research data management through a robust research data management plan during any research project or programme lies primarily with Principal Investigators (PIs) although all researchers have a personal responsibility to manage effectively the data they create.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.5 Where a project involves external collaborators, the lead organisation is responsible for putting appropriate formal agreements in place covering the contributions and rights of the various organisations and individuals involved.  All such agreements should be reviewed and approved by the University before the project begins.  In cases where the project is led by an external partner there is still a requirement for data generated or shared by Ulster University to be managed by a named individual with the University, usually the Lead Researcher at Ulster.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.6 Research Data must be held in a managed storage environment throughout the period of retention.  Data must be retained in an appropriate format and storage facility, normally for a period of at least 10 years from the date of any publication which it is based upon.  Where specific regulations with regard to data retention apply, eg: from funders, these regulations should prevail, particularly where the required retention period is longer than the University requires.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.7 The University will provide an infrastructure and support service for the storage, backup, registration, deposit and retention of research data in support of current and future access and, where appropriate, guidelines and templates for the research data management process and plans.  Appropriate safeguards will be put in place to ensure the legitimate interests of subjects of research data are protected.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.8 Any research data which is retained or hosted outside the University (eg: in an external repository which is subject/journal or publisher specific) must be registered with the University.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.9 Research data selected for archiving must be made openly available, where appropriate, with as few restrictions as possible.  Data sharing represents a key component of good research practice that contributes to the University’s strategic objective of increasing the visibility of Ulster’s research.  The University encourages researchers that have created or captured data to make it available for access and use in a timely manner, in conditions where it is feasible under contractual, legislative, regulatory, ethical or other obligations.  Where necessary, appropriate safeguards should be put in place to protect participants and ensure that access conditions are met (e.g. Anonymisation, access passwords, inclusion of rights statement) in compliance with Ulster University’s guidance on good research practice.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.10 Research data produced and/or used during research must in cited in research outputs.  Good research practice is built upon the recognition of all source material that contributes to the performance of research activities.  Researchers must ensure that research data used during the research process is cited in conference papers, journal articles and other research outputs. Journal publications that report on publically funded research should include an access statement that indicates how research data may be accessed and any associated conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "A persistent identifier, such as a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) should be included when one is available\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "3.12 Exclusive rights to host, reuse or publish research data should not be handed over to commercial publishers or agents without retaining the rights to make the data openly available for re-use, unless this is a condition of funding.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 4 Responsibilities\n",
      "\n",
      "4.1 The Pro Vice-Chancellor (Research & Impact) is responsible for overseeing and ensuring the implementation of this policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.2 The University is responsible, through the Department for Research & Impact, for providing an appropriate infrastructure for the long-term storage of data including, training, guidance and support for those responsible for the creation of research data.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.3 Associate Deans (Research & Impact)/Research Directors are responsible for ensuring tha researchers in their areas are aware of this policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.4 The practical and operational responsibility for research data throughout the lifecycle of the project is the responsibility of the Principal Investigators.  Their key responsibility is to ensure the Data Management Plan adheres to the research funders’ obligations and compliance with this policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.5 All Researchers must adhere to their obligations under this Policy either as Principa Investigator or by proactively supporting the Principal Investigator.\n",
      "Responsibility and rules for management of research data\n",
      "\n",
      "The main rule is that research data must be managed correctly and securely in accordance with current legislation, ethics and good research practice.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 5.1 Publication of research data\n",
      "\n",
      "Umeå University adopts the Swedish Research Council’s recommendations for publishing research data in the version published by the council in spring 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Swedish Research Council recommends that research data financed via public funds, and applicable legislation allows to be published, should be published openly on the internet within a reasonable time after the research results have been published.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Legal and ethical aspects affect access\n",
      "\n",
      "Determining which data can be published with open access shall always be based on applicable legislation. Some research data must not be published with open access due to legal or ethical aspects (if they are covered by secrecy legislation, include personal data or IP material, for example), but the options for publishing data may also be affected by other factors, such as the volume of the data sets.\n",
      "\n",
      "If open access to research data cannot be provided, the reason why this is not possible should be documented.\n",
      "\n",
      "Data created in the research process and forming the basis for publications This recommendation covers data created during the research process and forming the basis for scientific publications. If already existing data from other actors have been used, such as various types of public agency data, then these data only constitute research data if they have been analysed, processed or otherwise refined during the research process. Already existing data that have only been used in their original form and that are already managed and made accessible by another actor are not covered by this recommendation.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Metadata should also be published with open access\n",
      "\n",
      "Both research data and data describing research data (known as metadata) should be published with open access. If there are obstacles to publishing research data, the focus should in the first instance be on making metadata openly accessible on the internet. In this way, users can find information on what research data exists, even when there are obstacles to open publication, for example lack of a suitable publication platform or technical limitations that prevent all data from being published.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Publication according to the FAIR principles\n",
      "\n",
      "Publication of research data can be done using various digital platforms, for example via the higher education institution where the research is conducted or via other relevant national and/or international portals, infrastructures and similar organisations and platforms. The publication of research data shall always be based on the FAIR principles.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 5.2 Data management plans\n",
      "\n",
      "Umeå University recommends its researchers to write a data management plan5 at the beginning of each research project and to keep it updated continuously throughout the project. A data\n",
      "\n",
      "management plan should, for instance, specify how research data is to be collected, stored, managed, documented, used and made accessible during and after the research project. Umeå University has a template for data management plans, which, together with help texts, is also available in an online tool. In some cases, it is mandatory for researchers to establish a data management plan, for instance for certain research projects funded by the EU and by the Swedish Research Council. A data management plan should also be set up for all new doctoral student projects, together with the corresponding research plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 5.3 Ownership and collaborations\n",
      "\n",

      "# ULB Institutional policy on Research Data Management\n",
      "\n",
      "## Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "At its Academic Council meeting of 26 April 2021, ULB adopted the following policy1 on the management of Research Data, generated and processed by Researchers as part of their research activities at ULB.\n",
      "\n",
      "This policy aims to develop and promote a solid and secure management of Research Data to increase the efficiency, the quality, the integrity and the transparency of scientific research, as well as to facilitate the development of new knowledge, and to ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations, ethical and contractual obligations, and provisions of external research funding agencies. Ideally, Research Data management should be considered and integrated throughout the life cycle of the research data.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, various research funders such as the FNRS or the European Commission are increasingly requesting that a Data Management Plan accompanies any funded project. This is thus an evolution that urgently needed to be acknowledged in our institution.\n",
      "\n",
      "This document represents an aspirational policy; its implementation will likely take several years and require communication and support efforts towards the scientific community\n",
      "\n",
      "Practical Guidelines are available on the ULB personnel portal:  \n",
      "\n",
      "## Definitions\n",
      "\n",
      "Anonymisation: Process by which personal data is irreversibly altered in such a way that a data subject can no longer be identified directly or indirectly, either by the data controller alone or in collaboration with any other party.\n",
      "\n",
      "Archive or Data Repository: Copy of Curated Data made for long-term usage and reference. Archived data need to be replicated in several regularly checked copies. Migration to open file formats is recommended to ensure re-usability in the long term.\n",
      "\n",
      "Archiving: Process of depositing data in an Archive or Data Repository for access and preservation, ensuring that data can still be found, understood, accessed, and used in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "Backup: Copy of active data used to quickly restore the original data in case of accidental data deletion,  corruption or disaster recovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Confidential Data: Data to which only a limited number of persons have access and which are meant for restricted use.\n",
      "\n",
      "Curated Data: Collected data that are organised and integrated from various sources. It involves data that are annotated, published and presented such that the value of the data is maintained over time, and the data remains available for reuse and preservation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Data Management Plan: A living document describing how data will be generated, handled, stored, used, disseminated and archived following the FAIR principles.\n",

      "\n",
      "Personal Data: Any information about an identified or identifiable natural person (the data subject). This definition is very broad: an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.\n",
      "\n",
      "Preservation: All measures taken after the Research Project ends, including financial and strategic decisions, to maintain the integrity and to extend the lifetime of data, documents or collections.\n",
      "\n",
      "Principal Investigator (PI): Experienced Researcher usually leading team members carrying out a research project under his/her scientific guidance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pseudonymisation: Processing of personal data in such a way that the data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional  information. More specifically, each data subject is assigned a code and the table of correspondence is kept in a separate file and is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure non-attribution to an identified or identifiable  person.\n",
      "\n",
      "Registration: Process following data acquisition by which data is identified as a unit for subsequent access and processing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Research Data: Data collected, observed, created or obtained from third parties by Researchers, for purposes of data analysis to produce original research information and results. Data can be raw, processed to a greater or lesser extent, or analysed, and can adopt a digital or non-digital form. Examples : software codes, equations, images, photos, audio and video recordings, survey results, excel tables, texts, etc.\n",
      "\n",

Processing is necessary for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes, respect the essence of the right to data protection and provide for suitable and specific measures to safeguard the fundamental rights and the interests of the Data Subject.\n",
      "Principles\n",
      "\n",
      "(1) The University promotes best practice for research data management through clear policy, guidance, supervision, training and support.\n",
      "(2) Researchers, service providers and, where appropriate, research sponsors and external collaborators should work in partnership to implement good practice.\n",
      "(3) Research data will be managed by Researchers to the highest standards throughout the research data lifecycle as part of the University’s commitment to research excellence.\n",
      "(4) Research data should be compliant to the principles of FAIR data (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Re-Useable): Findable: Identifiable, retrievable, and available when needed; Accessible: Able to be made available to others in line with appropriate legal, statutory (including data protection regulations), ethical, contractual, intellectual property, data sharing and open access principles in a suitable repository or archiving system with persistent identifiers. Interoperable: Should be accurate, complete, authentic and reliable, and where possible made available in non-proprietary formats that facilitate data exchange and re-use; Re-Useable: Assigned a licence for open use where possible in compliance with intellectual property rights, and if no third-party rights, data protection, legal requirements or property laws prohibit it.\n",
      "(5) Research data should be kept in a manner that is compliant with legal and ethical obligations and, where applicable, the requirements of funding bodies, publishers and protocols set out in the National Policy Statement on Ensuring Research Integrity in Ireland.\n",
      "(6) Research data should be retained in a secure environment for as long as it is of continuing value to the researcher and the wider research community, and as long as specified by research funder, publisher, patent law, legislative and other regulatory requirements. The normal minimum retention period for research data is ten years after publication or public release of the work of the research. (Longer periods apply in certain cases, such as in relation to historical data.) If data includes personal or sensitive information, informants must be informed of the data retention policy at the time data is collected, in compliance with data protection regulations.\n",
      "\n",
      "(7) If research data is to be deleted or destroyed, either because the agreed period of retention has expired or for legal or ethical reasons, this should be done so in accordance with all legal, ethical, research funder and collaborator requirements and with particular concern for confidentiality and security.\n",
      "\n",
      "(8) If a personal data breach occurs, it is to be dealt with in accordance with UCD data protection policies.\n",
      "\n",
      "(9) Increasingly, research projects are funded by external parties and/or involve collaboration with third parties such as other research performing organisations, charities, industry, etc.  In such cases, contractual requirements such as the funder’s terms and conditions, grant agreement(s), collaboration agreement(s), industry contract(s) etc. may apply to the project. These contractual requirements constitute legally binding obligations on the University and the Researchers involved in the project, and often include specific provisions regarding ownership, management, retention and access to data, confidentiality obligations, IT security, publication requirements etc.  Contractual obligations apply in addition to the principles and requirements contained in this policy.  If there is a conflict between this policy and a contractual obligation, the contractual obligation will override the requirements of this policy and it is the researcher’s responsibility to ensure compliance.\n",
      "Implementation framework\n",
      "\n",
      "3.1. Preparation of the research\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3.1.1. Data Management Plan (DMP)\n",
      "\n",
      "In the context of integrity and transparency of research and FAIR data for Open Science, UMC Utrecht researchers are required to fill in a DMP for scientific research7 using the UMC Utrecht specific DMP template, unless a funder has a mandatory template8. The UMC Utrecht DMP template supports researchers with examples of answers, and with information about the specific subjects.  Data managers can be consulted if necessary.  With this , the UMC Utrecht aims for transparency in data management processes and compliance with legislation and regulations. The content of the DMP is in line with national and international initiatives9.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3.1.2. Storage and organization of files\n",
      "\n",
      "For research purposes, UMC Utrecht offers the Research Folder Structure. Separate storage of personal data and research data is possible here. The storage location is recorded in the Data Management Plan. The storage location is under management at UMC Utrecht unless otherwise stated in the Data Management Plan. The principal investigator is responsible for the proper management of the research folders. The organization and access to folders is carried out by an authorized employee on behalf of the principal investigator.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3.2.2. Registration of research participation\n",
      "\n",
      "In view of patient safety, it is important that every participation in scientific research is registered in the electronic patient database (EPD). This also applies to healthy volunteers. In case, for valid reasons, it is not desirable to register healthy subjects in the EPD, one can deviate from registration in the EPD ( see SOP Performing WMO-study). This must be documented in the DMP.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3.2.3. Re-use of data\n",
      "\n",
      "Re-use of healthcare data (retrospective studies) is possible after pseudonymization of the data (see also 3.3.2). Data that are collected in healthcare, are made available for research in the Research Data Platform (RDP). For specific expertise and guided searches in sources one can use the Utrecht Patient Oriented Database (UPOD). Making data available for reuse must always comply with applicable laws and regulations. For the use of external data sources for research, researchers turn to the supplier of the data and jointly draw up a Data Access Agreement. Often this is based on documents from the supplier.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3.2.4. Raw data storage\n",
      "\n",
      "Collected data, whether this has been done via re-use or via new data collection,  needs to be stored and frozen (read only) as 'raw data' immediately after collection. Raw data are not to be edited or changed. This is necessary, so that, at any time, one can trace back to the original data.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3.3. Data preparation\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 3.3.1. Validation\n",
      "\n",
      "All adaptations for validation and preparation of a suitable dataset for analysis are documented in such a way that the research results are verifiable. For all scientific research it is mandatory to keep an audit trail. When the raw data consists of care data which are erroneously recorded in the electronic patient files (EPD), the usual care processes are followed to adjust that information.  This means that only the care provider can change this data, and not the researcher.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 3.3.2. Anonymize/Pseudonymize\n",
      "\n",
      "Directly identifying personal data must be stored separately from the research data, and research data must be anonymised or pseudonymised. Care data are almost always indirectly traceable to the person and completely anonymizing will therefore often not be possible.  A pseudonymised file can indirectly be traced back to a natural person, as long as a key file exists. An important reason to still pseudonymise data is that this removes the direct traceability to a person. Technical facilities (such as the RDP and the Research Folder Structure) and procedural provisions ensure that the researcher does not have access to the directly identifying data.  In case of indirect traceability to a person in research files, appropriate measures are taken to remove the indirect traceability to an individual when publishing or sharing data10.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 3.3.3. Storage of analysis file\n",
      "\n",
      "After validation and preparation, and before final analysis and reporting, the analysis file is to be frozen. The analysis file is pseudonymised, or anonymized. For separate storage of personal data and research data, the Research Folder Structure can be used.  In a frozen data collection it is no longer allowed to change or add data. Statistical analyses are only performed on the frozen datasets.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 3.3.4. Requirements for data storage\n",
      "\n",
      "For all types of research, the storage location is physically and digitally protected. The policy of UMC Utrecht regarding information security is described in the Information Security Directive. UMC Utrecht provides a number of storage locations that meet these requirements, such as bulk storage and departmental disks.  The DMP must describe where the data is stored, so that it is clear for every employee in the research team, where the data can be found.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 3.3.5. Data exchange during a study\n",
      "\n",
      "Exchanging data with internal colleagues and external partners during a study, is done in a safe manner according to the regulations of the UMC Utrecht, which can be found under this link. Prior to the exchange\n",
      "\n",
      "and sharing of data with external parties, a Data Transfer Agreement has been drawn up, which establishes the conditions under which data are shared.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3.4. Metadata and Documentation\n",
      "\n",
      "Metadata provide the information needed to enable a broad scientific community to find, share and understand the content and context of a dataset.  When compiling metadata, standardization is sought as much as possible.  With the mandatory DMP, UMC Utrecht supports researchers in the implementation of good metadata of research data, which is a prerequisite for FAIR data.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3.5. Data Analysis\n",
      "\n",
      "The scripts for data analysis are saved and commented (thus creating an audit trail), so that, when the script is read by an experienced colleague researcher/statistician/data analyst, it is completely clear why the steps in the analysis have been taken and which choices have been made.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3.6. Data Archiving\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 3.6.1. Transfer of custody after completion\n",
      "\n",
      "When a principal investigator leaves after completion of the research, the management of the research folder and all data must be transferred to the new responsible person or to the department head.

Data archiving, on the other hand, is about the sustainable accessibility of the research data, where the data are provided with metadata, documentation and a persistent identifier. Subsequently, it is decided where the data and/or metadata will be archived for sustainable accessibility.  This does not necessarily mean that the data is available to everyone, see Data Sharing.

      "\n",
      "1.2. Most research funders, including all research councils under the auspices of UKRI, Wellcome and charity funders have data management and sharing policies, and Data Management Plans (DMPs) are now a key part of most funding applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.3. Well managed data enables research data to be securely and reliably stored long term. It enables discoverability, accessibility and reuse where appropriate, and it supports transparency and scrutiny, facilitates collaboration and encourages the ethical re-use of data to maximise the intellectual, social, cultural and economic impact of the University of Bradford’s research.\n",

      "\n",
      "5.2.1 Researchers must comply with all legal, ethical, funding body and organisational requirements for the collection, use, re-use and storage of data, especially personal data, where particular attention should be paid to the requirements of the Data Protection Act 2018 and UK's General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR).\n",
      "5.2.2 The ownership of research data generated by persons employed by the University of Bradford is subject to the Intellectual Property Policy. Researchers and their institutions should apply appropriate licences to clarify ownership and use of data.\n",
      "5.2.3 They should maintain confidentiality where undertakings have been made to third parties or to protect intellectual property rights. Further expectations are elaborated in sections 6.7 and 6.8 of the University of Bradford Code of Practice for Research. Research data should be accurate, complete, authentic and reliable, and made available in a timely way with as few restrictions as possible.\n",
      "5.2.5 Research data should be accompanied by metadata that adheres to appropriate metadata standards.\n",

       "['# Aalto University  \\n\\n## Aalto University Research Data Management Policy  \\n\\nThe research data management policy aims to make data management easier for the individual researcher. Managing and curating data creates competitive edge, and allocating resources for that is a strategic choice of the university. The purposes of this policy are to (1) encourage to informed decision making in research data management and (2) define the principles used in the opening of publicly funded scientific research data to achieve wide societal impact and the strategic goals of Aalto University.  \\n\\nThe data management policy shall be implemented through conscious and strategic decisions. Open access publishing of research data aims to make research data easily discoverable, assessable, intelligible, usable and interoperable. Where applicable, these requirements can also be applied to data other than open access published research data, and to the software needed to handle the open data. The decisions to publish software, other than the software explicitly needed to handle the data, are done using the same conscious and strategic grounds as opening of the research data.  \\n\\nOwnership of copyright protected research data is transferred to Aalto University if the data is created in an externally funded research project of Aalto University.  Strategic decisions about opening such data are done by the principal investigators. These decisions are done following the guidelines for ethical principles of research as well as the guidelines for responsible conduct of research, project agreements and guidelines for processing of personal data in scientific research,   \\n   \\n\\nResearch data is not opened if the opening would violate privacy, safety, security, terms of project agreements or legitimate concerns of private partners. Researchers shall follow the \"Guideline on nondisclosure of information and information security classification at Aalto University\" and its appendix \"Rules on the handling of information materials\".    \\n\\nWhen deciding on the opening of research data, the possibilities for commercially exploiting the research results and data are taken into consideration. Aalto University will make agreements about the user rights of third parties according to the strategic goals of the university. Aalto University may also charge a fee from third parties for the use of research data.  \\n\\nOpenness of scientific research data will increase the scientific impact of the research, speed up the adoption of research findings and the creation of innovations, enable transparency in science, as well as ensure that research data has wide societal impact and usability in solving global challenges.  \\n\\nOpening access to research data shall be made easy for researchers and implemented in a cost-effective manner so that the resources invested are proportioned to the benefits attainable. An appropriate digital infrastructure will be made available to the researchers by combined European, national and Aalto University efforts.  \\n\\nThe Aalto University research data management policy applies to digital research materials produced, used and revised in research projects, i.e. research data. Physical materials on which research data are based shall be excluded from research data, along with the use of biological research materials. The concept of  \\n\\nAalto University Research Data   \\nManagement Policy   \\nDecision by president of 10 February 2016   \\nAppendix 1  \\n\\nresearch data is not specified further in this policy, as the quality and quantity of research data that is chosen for open access publishing is also chosen using the criteria above. (As regards university document preservation, a data management plan (DMP) required by the Archives Act and the instructions provided by Aalto University’s Archive and Registry Services  shall be abided by.)  \\n\\n### Principles for open access publishing of research data (recommended to be acknowledged in data management in general, where applicable)  ',\n",
       " 'Discoverability  \\n\\nThe location of research data and the necessary software to access the data is known and they are easily discoverable and identifiable by means of a standard international identification mechanism.  ',\n",
       " 'Accessibility  \\n\\nResearch data and the necessary software to access the data shall be easily accessible, along with other necessary information to access the data, such as a mention of the concerned research areas.  \\n\\nAn embargo period can be agreed upon, to achieve strategic advantage for the creator. The embargo period is expressed in connection with the material.  \\n\\nFor the research data, a licensing framework has been selected for research and educational use and for commercial exploitation. The license recommended for research data is Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) and the waiver recommended for metadata is CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication. The license recommended for software is the MIT Licence. Other licenses may be chosen to achieve the strategic goals of the research project. If research data is published using the CC BY 4.0 license, Aalto University and researchers obtain sufficient rights for the re-use of the data, even though the ownership of the research data is not transferred to the University. The terms of the CC BY 4.0 license require that the creators of the research data are attributed.  ',\n",
       " 'Assessability and intelligibility  \\n\\nThe research data and the necessary software to access the data shall be assessable for and intelligible to third parties for scientific scrutiny and peer review. Research data shall be published together with related scientific publications for the purposes of peer review. Research data shall be provided in a way that judgements can be made about its reliability and the competence of those who created it.  ',\n",
       " 'Usability  \\n\\nThe research data and the necessary software to access the data shall also be usable for purposes beyond the original project. The research data chosen for long-term preservation shall be safely stored and curated to ensure its usability for wider needs than merely a highly specialised expert group. Whenever possible, certified repositories are used for research data preservation.  \\n\\nResearch data shall be stored together with the minimum metadata and documentation to make it useful. Aalto University does not require the creator of the research data to offer support for further use of the data.  \\n\\nWhen applicable and allowed by previous licenses, the necessary software will also be stored together with the research data.  ',\n",
       " 'Interoperability  \\n\\nThe research data and the necessary software shall be produced in a manner that ensures their interoperability with applicable standards and special quality requirements. Interoperability shall be implemented in a way that allows data exchange between researcher groups, higher education institutions and research institutions in different countries. Interoperability will also allow for the re-combination of different datasets from different origins.  \\n\\n### Related documents and agreements  \\n\\nFinnish Advisory Board on Research Integrity (TENK): Ethical review in human sciences (TENK)   \\nResponsible conduct of research (TENK)   \\nGuideline on non-disclosure of information and information security classification at Aalto University Classification of Information, Guidelines   \\nClassification of Information, Rules on the Handling   \\nExamples of confidential data and IT services   \\n  Guidelines for processing of personal data in scientific research   \\n    \\nAnnex 1 to the Employment Contract, Terms and Conditions on Assigning Rights generated in All Projects which Receive Funding from External Sources   \\n  en_liite_20110831_2.pdf?version=1&modificationDate=1441263348088&api=v2 .   \\nCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)   \\nCC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication   \\nMIT Licence   \\nBackground documents   \\nGuidelines on Data Management in Horizon 2020   \\n    \\nGuidelines on Open Access to Scientific Publications and Research Data in Horizon 2020   \\n    \\nG8 Science Ministers Statement   \\n  Meeting_Statement_12_June_2013.pdf']"

Open access publishing of research data aims to make research data easily discoverable, assessable, intelligible, usable and interoperable. Where applicable, these requirements can also be applied to data other than open access published research data, and to the software needed to handle the open data. The decisions to publish software, other than the software explicitly needed to handle the data, are done using the same conscious and strategic grounds as opening of the research data.  \\n\\nOwnership of copyright protected research data is transferred to Aalto University if the data is created in an externally funded research project of Aalto University.  Strategic decisions about opening such data are done by the principal investigators. These decisions are done following the guidelines for ethical principles of research as well as the guidelines for responsible conduct of research, project agreements and guidelines for processing of personal data in scientific research,   \\n   \\n\\nResearch data is not opened if the opening would violate privacy, safety, security, terms of project agreements or legitimate concerns of private partners. Researchers shall follow the \"Guideline on nondisclosure of information and information security classification at Aalto University\" and its appendix \"Rules on the handling of information materials\".    \\n\\nWhen deciding on the opening of research data, the possibilities for commercially exploiting the research results and data are taken into consideration. Aalto University will make agreements about the user rights of third parties according to the strategic goals of the university. Aalto University may also charge a fee from third parties for the use of research data.  \\n\\nOpenness of scientific research data will increase the scientific impact of the research, speed up the adoption of research findings and the creation of innovations, enable transparency in science, as well as ensure that research data has wide societal impact and usability in solving global challenges.  \\n\\nOpening access to research data shall be made easy for researchers and implemented in a cost-effective manner so that the resources invested are proportioned to the benefits attainable. An appropriate digital infrastructure will be made available to the researchers by combined European, national and Aalto University efforts.  \\n\\nThe Aalto University research data management policy applies to digital research materials produced, used and revised in research projects, i.e. research data. Physical materials on which research data are based shall be excluded from research data, along with the use of biological research materials. The concept of  \\n\\nAalto University Research Data   \\nManagement Policy   \\nDecision by president of 10 February 2016   \\nAppendix 1  \\n\\nresearch data is not specified further in this policy, as the quality and quantity of research data that is chosen for open access publishing is also chosen using the criteria above.

       " '1. INTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE  \\n\\nThe maintenance of accurate and retrievable data arising from research projects is an essential component of good practice in the conduct of research and a key component of research integrity and research reproducibility. Consideration around research data management and evidence of good research data management should be seen as an integral part of the research process, which is what Aston University expects of all researchers. This is in line with Aston’s values and commitment to deliver research that changes lives for the better through collaborations between students, academic staff and industry leaders.  \\n\\nIn addition, good research data management can benefit the transparency, productivity and overall reliability of the research generated, supporting the research process and visibility of any research outputs. Evidence of good research data management is also a requirement of most funding bodies and publishers of journal articles. Aston University is committed to supporting its researchers to meet the highest standards of research data management and acknowledges that research data management involves numerous stakeholders across the research data lifecycle, from creation through to dissemination and preservation. Therefore, this policy is divided into distinct sections aimed at key stakeholders within the University.  \\n\\nThe University endorses the UKRI Common Principles on Data Policy.',\n",
       " '1.1. Purpose of the Policy  \\n\\nThis policy covers Aston’s approach to research data management.  \\n\\nThe purpose of this policy is to:  \\n\\nEnsure that researchers manage their research data effectively, enabling them to:  \\n\\nDemonstrate the highest standards of integrity of their research, Preserve eligible research data for sharing and reuse (as appropriate), Comply with ethical, legal, funder and other requirements in relation to research data and research data management.  \\n\\nEnsure that University Colleges understand their responsibilities in relation to governance of research data management in their departments, Ensure that the University responsibilities for research data management are clearly articulated.',\n",
       " '2. SCOPE OF POLICY  \\n\\nThis policy covers the processes, arrangements, and limitations for storing research data during the active research process.  \\n\\nFor the purposes of this policy, research data are as defined by the UKRI Concordat on Open Research Data1 as ‘the evidence that underpins the answer to a research question’. The research data can be quantitative or qualitative and may either be primary (generated first hand) or processed secondary data (building upon primary data) where the rights for the original data may be held elsewhere. Contemporary research data tends to exist digitally and takes many different forms including documents, spreadsheets, code, models, transcripts, images etc. However historic, and visual data can still exist in physical records including books, sketches, photographs, audiotapes, and specimens.  \\n\\nFor a more comprehensive table of research data examples please see Appendix 1.  \\n\\nIf you are engaged in a Knowledge Exchange activity whereby you are generating research data, you are expected to abide by the standards set out within this policy.  \\n\\nResearch data preservation for the purpose of sharing is covered by the Data Preservation and Open Research Data Policy.',\n",
       " '2.1 Who is Covered by the Policy  \\n\\nThis policy applies to all researchers (defined as any staff members conducting research and doctoral research students) at Aston University with contractual responsibility for research data generation, collection, and/or analysis, or who produce or use research data. The policy stands to detail the management of that data arising from their research, and the roles of the various individuals or services that will support the management of research data during its lifecycle.  \\n\\nThe policy does not apply to postgraduate taught and undergraduate students in the first instance, except where their research findings are included in published research outputs. They may be guided in the first instance by the principles contained within this policy.',\n",
       " '2.2 Ownership of this Policy  \\n\\nResearch Committee owns this policy and oversees research data management policy implementation via College Research Committees.  \\n\\nThe Chair of the Research Committee is responsible for ensuring that this policy is reviewed every two years (unless there is significant change in current regulations which impact this policy) and is fit for purpose.',\n",
       " '3. POLICY STATEMENT',\n",
       " '3.1. General research data management  \\n\\nThe University expects that the following general research data management principles will be followed:  \\n\\nResearch data should be actively managed to ensure that it is available for access, validation, and re-use (where appropriate). The rights and interests of research participants must always be protected. Researchers must comply with all relevant regulations, funder requirements, contractual obligations, and ethical requirements, as appropriate, at all times during their research.',\n",
       " '3.2 Research data  \\n\\nResearch data must be:  \\n\\nAccurate, auditable, authentic, and reliable.   \\nIdentifiable, retrievable, and available when needed.   \\nSecure and safe with appropriate measures taken in handling sensitive, classified, and confidential data.   \\nKept in a manner that is compliant with legal obligations, University policy and, where applicable, the requirements of funding bodies; and   \\nConsidered for long term preservation.  \\n\\nClear arrangements for research data management must be in place prior to research data generation. The University recommends that all research projects have an associated Research Data Management plan (RDMP), with named researchers and their responsibilities detailed within. This may be a mandatory requirement as part of a grant application, and your Strategic Funding Manager will advise if so. It is the responsibility of the researcher to consider how legal and ethical restrictions will impact on their ability to share data at the end of the project and it is recommended that these considerations are addressed in a RDMP.  \\n\\nResearch data must be stored and disposed of securely according to the relevant retention and disposal schedule, in accordance with legal, ethical, research funder and collaborator requirements and with particular concern for the confidentiality and security of the data. Records relating to research (e.g. master copies of approved consent forms, information sheets, records relating to ethical approval) should be retained for six years after the date of project closure, in line with the University Records Management Procedures. Research data that underpins published results or is considered to have long-term value should be retained.  \\n\\nResearch data should be stored on Box unless there are specific reasons why this is not practical, nor in line with a collaboration agreement (for example). In this case advice should be sought from Digital Services in the first instance, and the Research Integrity Office where appropriate.  \\n\\nThe deliberate or reckless mismanagement of research data and/or primary materials constitutes unacceptable research conduct and should be reported in line with the University Research Misconduct Policy or the Whistleblowing policy.',\n",
       " '3.3 Collaborative research  \\n\\nWhen participating in collaborative projects, an Aston University lead must be identified to take responsibility for management of research data produced under the auspices of Aston  \\n\\nUniversity. This person is also responsible for ensuring that data are managed appropriately and in line with any relevant contracts and/or ethics approvals in place.',\n",
       " '3.4 What to do when you leave Aston  \\n\\nThe University expects that researchers will make the necessary arrangements to deposit/archive research data associated with projects which are closed, or transfer/make available data and records which are associated with active research projects. It is expected that transfer will occur via Box, with shared ownership of relevant Box folders with other appropriate researchers within the University, noting that this should be done in line with any relevant contracts and/or ethics approvals in place. For any arrangements where Box cannot be used, Digital Services should be consulted to discuss and approve an alternative mechanism.',\n",

This document provides the policy framework through which this effective management can be achieved and audited.',\n",
       " '1. Purpose & Scope  \\n\\nThe purpose of this policy is to ensure that the University and the University’s staff and students comply with the provisions of the GDPR and the Act and with any other relevant legislation in jurisdictions in which the University operates when processing personal data. Any infringement of the Act will be treated seriously by the University and may be considered under disciplinary procedures.  \\n\\nThis policy applies to staff, students, agents of the University and any authorised processors of personal data held or owned by the University, regardless of where the data is held and, in respect of automatically processed data, the ownership of the equipment used, if the processing is for University purposes.  This policy also applies to personal data retained and processed by Bangor University Students’ Union.',\n",
       " '2. Data Protection Definitions',\n",
       " '2.1 Personal data  \\n\\nPersonal data is information that either on its own, or when combined with other information, can identify a living individual. This can include (but is not limited to):  \\n\\nNames, addresses, student and staff ID numbers, dates of birth, photographs, social media handles, video footage and emails.  \\n\\nThe main types of personal data that the University uses are: Staff Data, Student Data (prospective, current and alumni) and Research Data.',\n",
       " '2.2 Special Category Data  \\n\\nSpecial category data is personal data that needs more protection because it is sensitive. The GDPR defines special category data as:  \\n\\npersonal data revealing racial or ethnic origin;   \\npersonal data revealing political opinions;   \\npersonal data revealing religious or philosophical beliefs;   \\npersonal data revealing trade union membership;   \\ngenetic data;   \\nbiometric data (where used for identification purposes);   \\ndata concerning health;   \\ndata concerning a person’s sex life; and data concerning a person’s sexual orientation.',\n",
       " '2.3 Processing  \\n\\nData protection legislation refers to the processing of personal data. Processing simply means any use of personal data. This can range from collecting it to sharing it, from amending it to deleting it. The University needs to process information about its employees, its students and other individuals: for example, to allow it to  \\n\\nmonitor performance, achievements and health and safety, and so that staff can be recruited and paid, courses organised and legal obligations (e.g. to funding bodies and the government) fulfilled. Such information must be collected and used fairly, stored safely and not disclosed unlawfully.',\n",
       " '3. The Principles of Data Protection  \\n\\nThe University is required to adhere to the principles of data protection as laid down by the Act. In accordance with those principles personal data shall be:  \\n\\n1.  Processed fairly, lawfully and in a transparent manner The University must be open and clear about what the personal data will be used for and how it will be used.  \\n\\n2.  Processed for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes The University must ensure that it collects personal data for clear, appropriate and legitimate purposes. Collecting personal data “just in case” for future reference is not compliant with legislation.  \\n\\n3.  Adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the purposes for which they are processed The University must only collect, use or share personal data in a proportionate way. This means that it should collect what it needs to complete its purposes.  \\n\\n4.  Accurate and up to date Personal data must be accurate and up to date. Collecting inaccurate data is a breach of GDPR.  \\n\\n5.  Kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed   \\nPersonal data must only be kept for a specific period of time. This time period will vary depending on what purpose the personal data is collected for - the University’s Record & Data Retention Schedule details how long personal data should be kept for each function.  \\n\\n6.  Processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data  \\n\\nThe University is required to have appropriate technical and organisational measures in place to ensure the security of personal data. This is applicable to both data held electronically and personal data within physical documents.',\n",
       " '4. The Rights of the Individual  \\n\\nIn addition to the data processing principles, the GDPR also sets out a range of rights individuals can use to understand how their personal data is used or exert an amount of control over how it is used. The rights include:  \\n\\nThe right to be informed An individual has the right to be informed about the collection and use of their personal data.  \\n\\nThe right to access (often called Subject Access Requests)   \\nAn individual has a right to see a copy of the personal data held about them by the University and find out what it is used for. See 6.1 below for further details.  \\n\\nThe right of rectification An individual can request that inaccurate information held about them is either rectified or deleted.  \\n\\nThe right to erasure (also known as the right to be forgotten) An individual may ask for their personal data to be deleted by the University.',\n",
       " 'The right to restrict processing  \\n\\nAn individual has the right to request the restriction of suppression of their personal data (i.e. whilst a complaint is being dealt with the University can store the personal data, but not use it).',\n",
       " 'The right to data portability  \\n\\nAllows individuals to obtain and reuse their personal data for their own purposes across different organisations.',\n",

These Procedures also include requests for the provision of any CCTV footage2.  \\n\\nPersonal information held by the University is managed in accordance with the Data Protection Act 2018 (the Act) and the University’s Data Protection Policy3.  The Act and the University’s Policy provide guidance on the circumstances when it is lawful to disclose and transfer personal information outside the University and in general this should be carried out “fairly and lawfully” and in accordance with the University’s Data Protection Notification.  \\n\\nThere are, however, exemptions within the Act which allow the University, under strict guidelines, to release information to law enforcement agencies without the consent of the individual whose information is being released, and regardless of the purpose for which the information was originally collected.  \\n\\nIn particular personal information may be released if:  \\n\\nthe information is required for safeguarding national security failure to provide the information would prejudice the prevention or detection of crime, the apprehension or prosecution of offenders or the assessment or collection of any tax or duty  \\n\\nPersonal information may also be disclosed without contravening the terms of the Act where that disclosure is required by law.  \\n\\nBefore the University releases any information to a law enforcement agency it must satisfy itself that the disclosure is necessary and required for a legitimate purpose.  \\n\\nThe University seeks to co-operate with the police and with other agencies in the prevention and detection of crime and these Procedures set out the steps to be followed when responding to requests for personal information from these external agencies.  \\n\\nThese Procedures should also be considered in conjunction with the University’s Prevent Policy and its Information Sharing Agreement with partners to the Prevent and Channel Programme.',\n",

The Head of Governance and Compliance will then ensure that the request is handled in accordance with the remainder of these Guidelines.  Further advice on requests for information from the police or other agencies should be directed to the Head of Governance and Compliance.  \\n\\nStaff should not feel pressurised to disclose information “on the spot”, as it is very rare that the police or agencies require the information urgently (although such circumstances are dealt with in Section 4 below).',\n",

       " '# Brunel University Research Data Management Policy  \\n\\nResearchers and the University have obligations to preserve, store and provide access to research outputs, including research data. Demonstrable good practice in research data management and a commitment to data sharing are increasingly required by funding organisations and research partners. There are also benefits for the University and individual researchers: increased research impact and profile; wider benefits for the research community and the public; advancement of knowledge; opportunities for growth.  \\n\\nThe following policy supports the Brunel University Research Data Management Vision, which was approved by Senate in March 2012 and forms part of the University’s research integrity code of practice.  \\n\\n## Vision  \\n\\nResearch data management is the planning, capture, review, publication, storage, preservation and re-use of data produced by research, irrespective of format.  \\n\\nThe University views effective research data management as an essential ingredient of a high quality research culture.   \\nIt assumes that all data produced by University researchers will be made available to the wider academic community, except where the right of individual researchers, or the subjects of the research, would be compromised by such release.   \\nThe University provides training, support, advice and information to support effective research data management.   \\nResearch data management is a shared responsibility. Individual researchers, academic units and central departments work together to develop research data management plans and implement them throughout the research life cycle.   \\nAll research proposals include an integral research data management plan.   \\nThe University actively supports the collection, storage, retention and cataloguing of all its research data (both raw and published) and promotes its re-use by other researchers where appropriate and with due safeguards.   \\nResearch data management policies safeguard the interests of participants in the research, the researchers and the University by facilitating compliance with relevant legislation.   \\nAll research data is stored securely and is registered with the University. Data is stored in the data centres of higher educational institutions or in subject-specific data services.   \\nAll University policies, including those on Intellectual Property, Good Research Practice and the Procedures for Investigation of Research Misconduct, support good practice in research data management.  \\n\\n   \\n\\nThis policy will continue to evolve in line with the changing research environment, in consultation with the research community.  \\n\\n# Policy  \\n\\n## Scope of applicability  \\n\\nResearch data is defined as the evidence base on which academic researchers build their analytic or other work (HEFCE, 2008).  \\n\\nThis policy applies in the first instance to academic staff and postgraduate research students (PGRs). It is expected that data generated by undergraduate (UG), postgraduate taught students (PGTs) and non-academic staff in the normal course of study or administration will normally be exempt from this policy, except where any of the following applies:  \\n\\na. data is generated in connection with an eligible research project, eg funded in whole or in part by Research Councils UK (RCUK), or other public body;   \\nb. the data is generated under a contract of employment with the University, or other agreement (such as a Non-Disclosure/Confidentiality Agreement with a research sponsor / partner;   \\nc. the individual staff member or student has formally published research outputs (conference proceedings, articles, monographs) from the data, in affiliation with Brunel University or jointly-authored with Brunel University staff.  \\n\\nThe terms of this policy will apply in this instance.

Ensure that ownership of research data and any intellectual property is in accordance with the BNU Intellectual Property Policy and that said ownership is properly established before the start of a project.   \\nCreate and adhere to Data Management Plans (DMPs) for research projects in line with funders’ requirements. All plans should address data capture, documentation and metadata, ethical and legal compliance, storage and backup, and selection of data for long term storage. DMP Online provides an online tool to support the creation of Data Management Plans.   \\nDeposit their data in an appropriate data repository and provide sufficient information (such as a metadata record) to ensure that it can be found, understood, and cited. Where data is deposited somewhere other than BNU’s institutional repository (BNU Knowledge Archive), a metadata record should also be created in the BNU repository which describes and points to the data. External repositories, where used, should support the use of Open Researcher and Contributor IDs (ORCIDs) and Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs).   \\nShare data in accordance with the principles of open access (see BNU’s Open Access Policy).   \\nWhere possible, researchers should seek to recover any cost associated with research data management from the funding body.  \\n\\n14 All research data must be registered with the University whether it is hosted by the University or retained elsewhere. Researchers are responsible for informing the Research and Enterprise Directorate of the location of the data and who will have access to it. BNU retains the right to store a copy of the data for an acceptable period to ensure regulatory or contractual compliance. Guidance on how to register data with BNU, is available on the Research Data Management pages of the staff intranet.  \\n\\n15 Data should be preserved in accordance with the project specific Data Management Plan, which will outline specific retention periods. These periods may vary depending on the nature of the data and the requirements of specific research projects, as discussed in section 8. The Records Retention Schedule provides guidance on the preservation of data.  \\n\\n16 Not all research data is suitable for long term preservation, for example data which contains highly sensitive personal information that cannot be adequately anonymised, when consent has been withdrawn, or when legal or ethical constraints dictate otherwise.

It is nonetheless the ultimate aim that all research carried out by staff and students at Cardiff Met will be conducted within the auspices of this policy.  This will be achieved via a phased implementation of a programme of support which will encourage changes in research data management practices across the institution.',\n",

This being the case, research data produced by Cardiff Metropolitan University will be accurate, complete and reliable and every effort will be taken to ensure data are identifiable and retrievable, and openly available where appropriate.  Data shall be stored in a manner compliant with legal and ethical obligations as well as any requirements specific to the funder of the research.  Where issues of confidentiality and/or anonymity arise, these shall be of paramount importance when considering how and where data will be stored and made available.  \\n\\n4.2 Data will be stored in a secure repository suited to the data set concerned. Where data are stored in an external repository, full details of the location of the data will be registered with the institution and details will be attached to any relevant publications by the Library.  \\n\\n4.3 Data supporting and underlying published research outputs will, wherever possible, be made available upon publication of the output and will be preserved for an appropriate period.  To enable this, sufficient metadata will be recorded and made available to enable others to understand the research and re-use potential of the data. Published outputs will include information on how to access the supporting data.  \\n\\n4.4 The minimum period for retention of research data will be ten years from the date of publication.  However where the funder of the research requires a longer retention period, this will be adhered to.  \\n\\n4.5 Retention periods will be decided as part of the Data Management planning exercise. Once the initial retention period as stated in the Data Management Plan has lapsed, a review will take place to assess whether the data should be retained for a further period.  Data with acknowledged long-term value will be preserved and remain accessible and usable for future research.  Conversely, data which has attracted little interest for more than ten years will not be expected to be retained.  \\n\\n4.6 The storage of outputs and data derived from undergraduate or taught post graduate research projects will be subject to the expectations of this policy where it is the intention to publish the results of the research.  In cases where there is no intention to publish, the storage of the outputs and data will be governed by the regulatory arrangements of the relevant award.  \\n\\n4.7 It is recognised that there are instances where it is necessary to restrict access to research data however, any access restrictions placed on data must be justified and justifiable.  It is anticipated that such restrictions will be related to the maintenance of confidentiality, the protection of the privacy of research participants, commercial sensitivity or issues related to IP.  \\n\\n4.8 Where confidentiality provisions apply, data will be kept in a way that reference to them by third parties can occur without breaching such confidentiality.  Confidentiality agreements to protect intellectual property rights may be agreed between the institution, the researcher and a sponsor of the research. Where such agreements limit free publication and discussion, limitations and restrictions must be explicitly agreed.',\n",

As a general rule, people participating in research must not be exposed to risks that are greater than or additional to those they encounter in their normal lifestyles.  \\n\\n4.2 If it is expected that harm, unusual discomfort or other negative consequences might occur in the prospective participant’s future life as a result of participating, the lead researcher must, prior to the person’s participation, obtain written consent of the participants.  \\n\\n4.3 Before participating, people must be informed of procedures for contacting the lead Head of the Ethical Research Committee within a reasonable time, if following participation they experience stress, harm or have related concerns.  \\n\\n4.4 In the case of interviews and questionnaires, the content and line of questioning may be highly sensitive, raise confidential, personal issues and intrude, or be perceived to intrude, upon a participant’s comfort and privacy. The initial judgment on whether or not questions are sensitive and likely to cause harm rests with a lead researcher. Researchers are encouraged to seek advice regarding these issues (for details about advisory bodies at CEU see Annex 2.).',\n",
       " 'Obtaining Consent  \\n\\nResearchers should normally carry out investigations with the valid consent of participants having taken all reasonable and practicable steps to ensure that they, or their authorized representatives, have adequately understood the nature of the research and any anticipated consequences. Under no circumstances must coercion be used to obtain a person’s consent to participate in research. Ideally consent should be obtained in writing but where this is not possible oral consent should be obtained.  \\n\\n#### 5.1 Informed Consent  \\n\\n5.1.1 Informed consent is a process by which a prospective participant, prior to participating in research:  \\n\\n(i) Is fully informed about all aspects of the research project, which might reasonably be expected to influence willingness to participate. In addition, the researcher must explain all other aspects of the research about which the prospective participants enquire. Such aspects will include some or all of the following:  \\n\\n• the nature and objectives of the project   \\n• the methodology of the project and conditions under which it is to be conducted   \\n• the persons/institutions that will have access to personally identifiable information about participants   \\n• the form in which research results will be published/communicated (e.g. aggregate statistical form)   \\n• who is undertaking and who is sponsoring the project   \\n• the potential risks and inconveniences that may arise   \\n• the potential benefits that may result • what participation in the research will require   \\n• whether it will be possible, and if yes, until what point, to withdraw from participation (ii) Freely and voluntarily gives consent to participating.  \\n\\n5.1.2 In case where, due to the nature of the research, informed consent is possible only after the researched situation is over, the researchers should obtain the consent as soon as the situation is over and when the participants do not consent the records of the situation should be destroyed in the presence of the participants.  \\n\\n5.1.3 Giving and obtaining consent can be a process, not always a one-off event and participants have the right to change their minds and withdraw consent at any time. However, if the withdrawal of consent occurs at the time when it affects the possibility of the finalization of the research (for instance, shortly before publication or thesis defense), the withdrawal should result only in the deletion of all personally identifiable data of the participant both in published materials and in stored and processed research data. If a researcher doubts whether a person participating in research still consents to participating s/he must clarify this with the person in question.  \\n\\n5.1.4 If the prospective participant is, for any reason, unable to understand the implications of participation, then the researcher is responsible for obtaining the informed consent of the parents/legal guardians of the prospective participant.  \\n\\n#### 5.2 Coercion  \\n\\n5.2.1 Where a relationship exists between the researcher and participant (e.g. employees, patients, students or anyone in a dependence relation) careful consideration as to the nature of consent is required. Willingness to volunteer may be unduly influenced by the expectation of benefits or rewards. When research is being conducted with detained persons (e.g. prisoners) particular care must be taken over informed consent, paying particular attention to the special circumstances that may affect the person’s ability to freely and voluntarily give informed consent.  \\n\\n5.2.2 People volunteering to participate in research may be paid for their inconvenience and time (taking into account the practices of a given academic discipline). Payments made to individuals must not be so large as to induce the individuals to risk harm beyond that which they would usually undertake. Financial payments might cover reimbursement for travel expenses and / or time. Risks resulting from participation must be acceptable to participants even in the absence of inducement.  \\n\\n5.2.3 The promise of compensation and care for damage, injury or loss of income as a result of participating in research activities to participants should not be considered coercion by inducement.  \\n\\n#### 5.3 Research Involving Incompetent Adults  \\n\\n5.3.1 Where a prospective participant is unable to give informed consent to participate a ‘legal representative’ may give assent on his/her behalf (in case of uncertainty the researchers should seek professional advice on the competence of participants). The person unable to give consent should still receive information according to their capacity to understand, setting out the risks and benefits of participating in the research.  \\n\\n5.3.2 In the case of an adult this could be a person designated by the adult, a relative or an independent person nominated by, for example, the hospital at which the research is being undertaken. If the adult has appointed a representative who is available, then this person must be used to give assent. A relative can only be used if the person has not appointed a representative or if the representative is not available. An independent person should only be used if both the adult’s representative and a relative are not available.  \\n\\n#### 5.4 Research Involving Children  \\n\\n5.4.1 Research involving children exists within both a legal framework and a more traditional context. The following guidance seeks to facilitate research involving children within a legal environment whilst respecting and taking into consideration the traditional and sometimes more formal guidance/procedures many settings may have. Laws of the country where the research takes place should be applied in determining whether participants in the research are children.  \\n\\n5.4.2 Parents (and others with parental responsibility) may agree to their children taking part in research, but where a child is able to understand sufficiently to give informed consent, their consent should be obtained in addition to parents’.  \\n\\n5.4.3 It is the researcher\\'s responsibility to assess whether the child has sufficient understanding to consent to the research. Children’s capacity to consent to research depends on their understanding of the research to be undertaken. Where information about the research and study can be given clearly and simply, it is possible for quite young children to consent to take part in research.  \\n\\n5.4.4 For a child to give valid consent they would need to understand the nature of the engagement with the researcher and understand that it is different to other interactions with those who may seek information from the child. Particularly, the child must be able to understand that the researcher is not able to make decisions about their life, and will use the information the child provides, but not in a way which would allow others to identify the child.  \\n\\n5.4.5 Where a researcher wishes to include children in a study whom he/she considers is not mature enough to decide about participation he/she must obtain the agreement of at least one person who has parental responsibility for the child before engaging them in any research activity.  \\n\\n5.4.6 Where children are considered competent by a researcher to participate they should be accorded the confidentiality as would an adult. There are however two areas of concern where the same level of confidentially cannot be promised to a child: where a child discloses that they are being seriously harmed or ill-treated, or where the researcher discovers a condition about which the parents could take action to benefit the child. In these instances researchers could be seen to have a duty of care to disclose such information to relevant third parties.  \\n\\n5.4.7 In the case of research in educational settings, any special school policies or procedures must be followed and efforts made to fully inform those responsible for children in these settings of the purpose and benefits of any proposed research with children.  \\n\\n#### 5.5 Research in Public Contexts and With Groups  \\n\\n5.5.1 In certain types of research obtaining consent from every individual participating is impractical or unfeasible (e.g. observing a large crowd or observing discussions on the internet). In such types of research researchers must ensure the following:  \\n\\n(i) That such research is only carried out in public contexts;   \\n(ii) That no details that could identify specific individuals are given in any reports on the research unless reporting on public figures acting in their public capacity (e.g. reporting a speech by a named individual);   \\n(iii) That unless those observed give their consent to be observed, observational research should only occur where those observed would expect to be observed by strangers.  \\n\\n5.5.2 The privacy and psychological well-being of people participating in observational research and people participating in research activities in which a researcher may actually be acting as a fellow  \\n\\nparticipant, for example as part of a wider group, must be respected. In such group based, participatory research activities the usual effort should be made to ensure that the group leader(s), or others in positions of responsibility, as well as other individuals of a group, are made aware that they participate in their activities with research purposes. If this \"open strategy\" is not pursued, the researcher must be able to make an explicit and convincing case why this was not done.  \\n\\n5.5.3 It is recognized that in certain types of observational research or organizational settings it may be more difficult to explain to people participating their right to withdraw at any stage. However, in such types of research, researchers are expected to make a reasonable attempt to do so.  \\n\\n#### 5.6 Research Involving Deception  \\n\\n5.6.1 In certain research disciplines (e.g. psychology), to ensure the viability of a piece of research, it is sometimes necessary to withhold information on the true objectives of the research from the people participating in it. In such types of research it is impossible to obtain informed consent from the participants. Wherever possible such research should be avoided and the Ethical Research Committee will pay particular attention to research involving deception. Where deception or the misleading of participants is considered necessary, the central principle to consider when deciding the ethical soundness of deception is the anticipated reaction of the participant once debriefed. If it is likely that the participant will be angry, or show unease once debriefed the research is likely to be deemed unacceptable.  \\n\\n5.6.2 However, when such research, requiring consent but not informed consent from participants, is judged to be necessary for the results of the research to be valid, researchers must exercise particular caution. In such circumstances the lead researcher has a special responsibility to: (i) Justify that alternative procedures to avoid the withholding of information or deliberate deception are not available and, if available, are not feasible for the research; (ii) Justify why the withholding of information, or an element of concealment or deception, is integral to the viability of the research.  \\n\\n#### 5.7 Research Involving Personal Data  \\n\\nIn all cases where personal data is collected, recorded, used, or managed in any other way during research, the relevant privacy rules of CEU’s Data Protection Policy shall be followed, as applicable.',\n",
       " 'Debriefing  \\n\\nDebriefing does not provide a justification for unethical aspects of research but is rather a means for researchers to discuss with participants their experience of the research and to monitor any unforeseen negative effects or misconceptions. Debriefing is particularly important where any form of deception has been used and researchers have a responsibility to ensure that participants have received any necessary debriefing in the form of active intervention before they leave the research setting.',\n",
       " 'Research conducted in cross-cultural contexts  \\n\\n7.1 Researchers should bear in mind the differences between civil, legal and often the financial positions of national and foreign researchers and participants and must be aware that there may be a number of national laws which can affect the conduct of their research. 7.2 Researchers should endeavour to balance professional integrity with respect for national and international law in the context of their research.  \\n\\n7.3 Researchers should endeavour to ensure that research is conducted with respect for underrepresented social groups and that attempts are made to avoid their marginalization or exclusion. 7.4 Researchers should endeavour to ensure that the concerns of relevant stakeholders and user groups are addressed.',\n",
       " 'Confidentiality, Anonymity and Privacy  \\n\\n8.1 The collection, storage, disclosure and use of personal data by researchers must comply with all legislation relating to data protection and arrangements must be put in place by researchers to carefully protect the confidentiality of participants and their data. Details that would allow individuals to be identified must not be published or made available to anybody not involved in the research unless explicit consent is given by the individuals concerned.  \\n\\n8.2 Before consent is obtained, researchers must inform prospective participants of:   \\n(i) Risks regarding the confidentiality of personal data and data revealed during research when the information is gathered in the presence of other participants (e.g. focus groups);   \\n(ii) Any potential risks that might mean that the confidentiality or anonymity of personal data may not be guaranteed;   \\n(iii) Which individuals and organizations, if any, will be permitted access to personal data, and under what circumstances such access will be granted;   \\n(iv) The purpose for which personal information provided is to be used (e.g. if video material might be used for teaching purposes).  \\n\\n8.3 If it is necessary, in undertaking research, to identify participants explicitly, then the researchers must explain why this is the case and how confidentiality will be protected. Researchers must be aware of the risks to anonymity, confidentiality and privacy posed by all kinds of personal information storage and processing which directly identify a person (e.g. audio and videotapes, electronic and paper-based files, e-mail records). 3 Measures to prevent accidental breaches of confidentiality must be taken, and in cases where confidentiality is threatened, relevant records should be destroyed. Provisions for data security at the end of a project must be made.  \\n\\n8.4 Guarantees of confidentiality and anonymity given to research participants must be honored, unless there are clear and overriding reasons to inform appropriate third parties (e.g. cases of child abuse, where an uninvolved 3rd party may be at risk through the participant’s actions or where a possibility of the participant’s self-harm is revealed during the research). All participants have the right to access personal information, whether or not it is confidential, that relates to them, and to be provided with a copy of the information on request (all participants have to be made aware of the process and researcher(s) responsible for providing the information). People should have the right, following the completion of their period of involvement in the research and following discussions with the researcher, to withdraw their consent and to require that their own data be destroyed, if practicable and unless the withdrawal jeopardizes the research at its final stages (see also: 5.1.2).',\n",

Preamble  \\n\\nCharles University is committed to ensuring that its research is transparent, replicable and its research results are widely accessible and reusable, in line with the principle ‘as open as possible, as closed as necessary’. The University strongly believes that such practice improves the quality of research and benefits not only the wider research community but individual researchers as well by fostering collaboration and increasing their impact. Making research results widely available will further highlight the excellence of the University’s\\xa0research and enable public engagement.  \\n\\nThe University recognizes that research data are an integral part of the research process and that research data management is a\\xa0key component of research quality and integrity. The aim is for the University researchers to produce research data that are managed in accordance with the FAIR principles.',\n",

Definitions  \\n\\nResearch data: Research data can be\\xa0characterised\\xa0as any information that has been collected, observed, generated, or created to validate or reproduce research findings. Research data can take various forms, including but not limited to documents, spreadsheets, images, audio and video recordings, code, software, laboratory notebooks or samples, and may be digital as well as non-digital.  \\n\\nMetadata: Metadata provide information about other data. They may include, for example, information about who the author of the data is, or when and where the data were created.  \\n\\nFAIR principles: The FAIR principles describe how research data should be organised so they can be more\\xa0Findable,\\xa0Accessible,\\xa0Interoperable and\\xa0Reusable.  \\n\\nData management plan (DMP): Data management plan (DMP) is a\\xa0document that specifies what data will be created and how, and outlines the plans for sharing and preservation of the data, both during and after the research project. DMP should be updated regularly to reflect what actually happened with the data.  \\n\\nRepository: Repository is a\\xa0digital online storage for storing and sharing the results of creative activities (e.g., publications or data).  \\n\\nPersistent identifier: Persistent identifier is a\\xa0long-lasting reference to a\\xa0unique entity. Persistent identifiers may be used, for example, for digital objects (e.g., DOI, handle), researchers (e.g., ORCID, ResearcherID), organisations (e.g., ROR) or other entities.  \\n\\nResearcher: Under this policy, the term researcher includes all members of the University, including staff and students, and affiliated persons who conduct research at or on behalf of the University.  \\n\\nPrincipal investigator: Principal investigator is a\\xa0researcher with an overall responsibility for a\\xa0research project.a\\xa0další entity.',\n",

Academic excellence presupposes trustworthiness and high integrity, i.e. honesty, transparency, and accountability of research, as stated in the Danish Code of Conduct for Research Integrity.  \\n\\nResearch data management ensures honest, transparent, and accountable research practices. Therefore, CBS encourages researchers to manage their data according to the FAIR-principles, thus making them findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable.3  \\n\\nCBS and the individual researchers share responsibilities to comply with the principles of responsible and FAIR research data management outlined in this policy. The policy specifies in more detail the obligations of both the institution and the researchers.',\n",

       " '2. Definitions  \\n\\nAccording to the Danish Code of Conduct for Research Integrity Research the term of research data contains two elements: primary materials and data.  Primary materials and data are defined as:  \\n\\nPrimary material is any material (e.g. biological material, notes, interviews, texts and literature, digital recordings, etc.) that forms the basis of the research.  \\n\\nData are the detailed records of the primary materials that comprise the basis for the analysis that generates the results.  \\n\\nResearch data management comprises the processes of collecting, processing, analysing, storing, sharing, long-term preserving, and disposing of research data. The key purpose of research data management is to ensure honest, transparent, and accountable research practices.  \\n\\nThe CBS Research Data Management Policy covers all kinds of primary materials and data relevant for CBS Research, but does not cover primary materials such as biological materials etc. Published and publicly available literature is considered as important primary material that is to be treated in accordance with the principles for Responsible Conduct. However, published and publicly available literature are exempted from the CBS Research Data Management Policy, and thereby not covered by its rules and recommendations.',\n",

       " '# Edinburgh Napier University Research Data Management Policy  \\n\\n## Introduction/Rationale  \\n\\nEdinburgh Napier University (the University) is committed to delivering excellent research and, as research data is at the very core of evidencing research quality and integrity, it is vital that robust research data management,  open data policies and procedures are in place to ensure that research conducted by, and under the auspices of, Edinburgh Napier University meets the highest standards to comply with legislative, regulatory, audit, funding body, partner (stakeholder) and internal requirements.  \\n\\nThis policy underlines the University’s commitment to the Universities UK Concordats on open research data and research integrity, by highlighting the importance of the management of research data to good governance and best practice.  \\n\\nFurther to this, in line with the UK and Scottish Government’ research funders (such as UK Research and Innovation, Horizon Europe and UK research charities) commitment to open data and to ensuring that the outputs from research are freely accessible, the University requires research data to be managed efficiently and effectively to facilitate such use, sharing and publication as appropriate to ensure the maximum benefit is derived from any research undertaken under its auspices.  \\n\\n# Scope of Policy  \\n\\nThis policy applies to all researchers and support staff employed to conduct research and innovation activities under the auspices of the University and to all research data regardless of how it is funded. It includes research undertaken by research postgraduate students.  \\n\\nThis policy covers all data, information and records created, received, and maintained during research activities, in any format whether physical and electronic. These might be quantitative information or qualitative statements collected by researchers in the course of their work by experimentation, observation, modelling, interview or other methods, or information derived from existing evidence. Data may be raw or primary (e.g. direct from measurement or collection) or derived from primary data for subsequent analysis or interpretation (e.g. cleaned up or as an extract from a larger data set) or derived from existing sources where the rights may be held by others.  \\n\\nThey may include statistics, instrument measurements, collections of digital images, sound or video recordings, transcripts of interviews, survey data and fieldwork observations with appropriate annotations, an interpretation, an artwork, archives, found objects, published texts or manuscripts, simulation data, models & software, slides, physical artefacts, specimens, samples, questionnaires, sketches, diaries, lab notebooks, social media data, etc.  \\n\\n## Policy Aims and Objectives  \\n\\n• To ensure that all colleagues dealing with research data recognise their responsibilities and the obligations placed on them and the University by stakeholders;  \\n\\n• To promote open access to research data to support collaboration;  \\n\\n• To ensure that the University fully complies with the requirements of specific funding bodies.  \\n\\n## Policy Statement  \\n\\nAll research data created during research and innovation activities, whether internally, unfunded, or externally funded, must be created, received, and maintained in accordance with associated policies and procedures and as defined in ENU’s Responsibilities guidelines.  \\n\\nA Research Data Management plan (DMP) or a declaration stating no data will be generated must be submitted as part of the project proposal for ALL research projects. The DMP must adhere to the requirements of the University using templates and guidance provided by the University, whether or not required by external funding bodies. Where specifically required by funding bodies, the Research Data Management Plan must meet the requirements of both the University and funding bodies.  \\n\\nIntellectual property, copyright and/or rights to re-use/share the data remain with the University (as per the Intellectual Property policy) unless otherwise dictated by the funding body and agreed by the University.  \\n\\nIf researchers/employees leave the University, data and records relating to any research conducted under the auspices of the University remain the property of the University. Remaining data files should be assigned a data custodian responsible for the management or the data.  \\n\\nWhere the Principal Investigator and the grant transfer to another institution during a project, the University will normally accord the rights for the data and records generated up to that time to transfer as an integral part of the research but will retain a copy as part of its own research record.  \\n\\nNew employees bringing with them existing research contracts are required to comply with the University’s policy on research data and records from the commencement of their employment.  \\n\\nEdinburgh Napier University Research Data Management Policy April 2015, Revision March 2022  \\n\\n## Responsibilities  \\n\\nThe most senior Edinburgh Napier University researcher associated with a research project is the Principal Investigator, unless specified otherwise on the funding application, for that project and is ultimately responsible for research data management and planning including making research data open.  \\n\\nIn the case of a PhD project, the Director of Studies is responsible. It is their duty to ensure that all members of the research team with access to the research data adhere to good research data management practice.  \\n\\nIn the case of collaborative projects, if the Principal Investigator is based elsewhere, the lead researcher at Edinburgh Napier University must take responsibility for all data generated here.  \\n\\nThroughout the lifecycle of the research data, researchers and support staff involved in the management of the data must ensure that the following principles are adhered to in order to achieve the objective of the capture and maintenance of authentic, reliable, open and re-useable data:',\n",

ETH is convinced that good data management enhances the robustness of research findings, facilitates research collaborations, makes research results more reproducible, and strengthens society’s trust in science.  \\n\\nETH Zurich therefore commits to creating a research environment that supports FAIR4 Research Data Management by design. ETH Zurich engages on a national and international level to provide a sustainable and suitable infrastructure for Research Data Management to offer its researchers information and services that satisfy the highest standards. The ideal to be strived for is Open Research Data (ORD) — the practice of making Research Data publicly available, accessible and reusable while always respecting legal and ethical framework conditions (“as open as possible, as closed as necessary”).  \\n\\nThe Guidelines for Research Data Management (hereinafter “RDM Guidelines”) specify further details of Research Data Management in accordance with Art. 10 Para. 4 of the ETH Zurich Guidelines on scientific integrity (Integrity Guidelines)5. They take into account strategic developments and activities on the national level and within the ETH Domain6. They serve to establish minimal requirements for all ETH Zurich members involved in scientific research and to define responsibilities. They can be complemented by departmental regulations which foster recognised Community Standards pertaining to Research Data Management and Open Research Data by design.',\n",

       " 'Art. 3   Definitions  \\n\\n1 Research Data are all data that the relevant scientific community accepts as necessary for validating research findings (based on Article 10 of the Integrity Guidelines).14  \\n\\n2 Metadata are data that provide information about data.  \\n\\n3 Programming Code signifies machine-readable instructions created in the context of a research project, for example, to analyse Research Data, to reproduce research findings from a given data set or to perform experiments.  \\n\\n4 FAIR Principles are internationally recognised guidelines to improve the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse of digital assets. The principles emphasise machine-actionability (for details see Annex A).15  \\n\\n5 Open Research Data (ORD) are Research Data that are FAIR and, in addition, publicly available, accessible and reusable at no cost. These guidelines understand ORD as an ideal to be strived for that might not be achievable in all cases (for justified exceptions see Art. 6.3).  \\n\\n6 Research Data Management (hereinafter “RDM”) is the systematic, transparent, and adequate handling of data across the complete data lifecycle using recognised services and infrastructures. Research Data Management planning includes measures to be undertaken at every step of the data lifecycle16 to ensure transparency and reproducibility of research. Data management planning starts from the creation and/or collection of data, followed by their analysis, publication, storage, sharing, preservation and reuse. Together, all these steps are continuously documented in a Data Management Plan (hereinafter “DMP”). In addition, RDM can support fulfilling the FAIR Principles by distinguishing data of temporary or permanent relevance according to accepted Community Standards and thus providing a reliable basis for informed decisions on data deletion, temporary retention (usually a minimum of 10 years), or unlimited preservation.  \\n\\n7 Community Standards are understood as both explicit, formalised standards and informal, but well established and widely accepted best practices within a community. A community can, e.g. comprise researchers sharing an interest in the same object of research or working with the same methods. Common Community Standards address, e.g. identification, citation and reporting of Research Data and Metadata. They reflect a community’s consensus, at a certain point in time, on how reproducible and reusable research should be implemented.  \\n\\n8 Data Availability Statements provide a statement about where data necessary for validating the research findings reported in a result publication can be found — including, where applicable, hyperlinks to publicly archived additional datasets analysed or generated during the research activity.  \\n\\n9 Research Group Leaders are professors or heads of platforms and scientific facilities who hold budget and the overall responsibility for a research group, platform, or facility.',\n",

       " '# Research Data Management Policy of the University of Münster  \\n\\n## Preamble  \\n\\nResearch data represents a central element of both academic activity and the ensuing acquisition of knowledge, and thereby serves as an essential tool for acquiring knowledge. In the following, ‘research data’ is defined as all data collected, mined, simulated or derived in connection with a research process. The University of Münster (WWU) regards research data, therefore, as an academic product, to which it attaches great importance. In order to acquire, disseminate and substantiate scientific findings, it is therefore absolutely vital that University staff manage research data in a responsible and academically appropriate manner.1 Handling such data requires early implementation of a research data management policy. This comprises all phases of planning and execution, i.e. generation and collection, as well as the processing, application and storage of research data. It also includes the documentation of the context and tools used for collecting this data, as well as provisions detailing its subsequent use, reproducibility and quality assurance.  \\n\\n## Principles  \\n\\nBased on “The German Research Foundation’s (DFG) Recommendations on Safeguarding Good Scientific Practice”2, the “Rules of Good Scientific Practice of the University of Münster”3 and the “DFG Guidelines on the Handling of Research Data”4, the University of Münster provides the following principles to serve as a guideline for its researchers. The University faculties are to tailor these principles to correspond to their subject-specific requirements.',\n",

Matters of ethics, data protection, copyright, confidentiality and secrecy are to be considered at all times.',\n",
       " 'At the start of a research project, the project director is responsible for clearly stating how the research data is to be handled and ensuring compliance with subject-specific standards.',\n",

       " 'Before a research project commences, the project director is called upon to explicitly determine and document all rights connected with research data resulting from the project, e.g. intellectual property rights, copyrights and usage rights. Particular attention should be paid to ensuring that the data remain freely accessible for academic purposes.',\n",
       " 'Research data which serves as the basis of published findings must be archived for long-term usage in a data repository of the University of Münster or a suitable, trustworthy external data repository. If this is impracticable for reasons of confidentiality or secrecy, then equivalent archival solutions have to be implemented. The researchers are personally responsible for determining when and under what legal and usage-related conditions their research data is to be made publicly available.',\n",

This policy is inspired by the FAIR principles: research data should be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) by archiving the data with proper documentation.',\n",
       " 'This policy cultivates:  \\n\\n: Best practice for ensuring that scientific arguments and results are reproducible in the long term.   \\n: Better exposure of academic work of researchers at TU Delft leading to   \\nrecognition of the quality of the research process as a whole.   \\n: Responsible management of research data, including the secure storage of   \\npersonal data (in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)/Algemene verordening gegevensbescherming (AVG))3 and the protection of intellectual property rights.   \\n: Improved practices for meeting the demands of funders and publishers with   \\nrespect to research data management and sharing.   \\n: Long term preservation of the data underlying publications for future users   \\nwithin and outside the research group. This cannot be guaranteed by publishing the data in supplementary materials or by only making the data available upon   \\nrequest.',\n",

All research is to be undertaken according to relevant legislation, the requirements of ethically responsible research, such as informed consent, academic integrity, the arrangements set out in cooperation agreements, and the research conditions of funders.   \\n2. When personal data are processed in research (within or from the EU), these must be handled in a way that meets the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). In particular, this entails the requirement to demonstrate that appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect the identity of research participants are in place.   \\n3. Where feasible and ethically appropriate, researchers will make their data FAIR (see below).   \\n4. Research methodologies, experimental design, data, data analysis, statistics, results and interpretations should be subject to peer review and scrutiny, and all researchers should be able to substantiate their choices, and be able to provide access to all research results (papers, data and code) for validation.',\n",

The four pillars of open science are open data, open code (research software), open papers (open access) and open reviews (open evaluation). The FoA stimulates making research data, lab notes and other research processes freely available where possible, under terms that enable reuse, redistribution and reproduction of the research and its underlying data and methods. Doing so will not only result in a more transparent, verifiable and faster research process, but will also enable companies and societal organisations to readily gain access to, and use scientific information in an early phase.',\n",

Any dataset can be registered in the UG Research Portal (using PURE) so that it is findable externally. Additionally, researchers can upload archived research data to an external repository. A data repository is a place that holds data, makes data available to use, and organises data in a logical manner. A data repository may also be defined as an appropriate, subject-specific location where researchers can submit their data.

Examples are: transferring the data package to another data archive (such as DANS Narcis) or the migration of file formats. Exclusive rights for the reuse or publication of research data will not be transferred to commercial publishers and their representatives without the owners themselves retaining the right to make available the research data for reuse through open access, unless this originally was a precondition for the provision of funds.  \\n\\nAny researcher who is responsible for a research project must draw up a data management plan (DMP) in any event prior to publication, but preferably before the start of the research project. The DMP should at least describe what data will be collected as part of the project, where the data will be stored and who has access to the data during the research project. It also states where (a version of) the data is archived as a data package, how the data package can be found, who can access it and under what conditions.  \\n\\nIf personal data are used in a research project, the DMP should explicitly describe what additional measures have been taken to ensure the lawful and careful handling of personal data. This might include a description of the legal basis for collecting the data (e.g. informed consent), the anonymisation method, and processing upon completion of the project (e.g. the destruction of contact details). Furthermore, a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) must be carried out.3 Finally, the data collection must be registered by the faculty data manager. The responsible researcher initiates these activities and ensures completion in the correct manner.  \\n\\nIn the case of human subject research, a proposal should furthermore be submitted to the Faculty Ethical Review Committee (FETC) prior to conducting the research.4 Data may not be collected until a positive assessment has been received.',\n",

The standard environment provided by the faculty for this purpose is YODA. Other options are the O: drive or SURFdrive. Researchers can consult the Research Data Management Support website to identify a suitable storage environment.5 Researchers may propose using a different environment and should first submit a proposal to the faculty data manager.   \\nIf the data contain personal data, the use of YODA as a storage environment is obligatory. It is possible to derogate from this obligation but only with the permission of the Information Security Officer. Local storage is temporarily permitted, for example, because data have been recorded on a peripheral device. However, the data must be encrypted for local storage, and transferred to YODA as soon as possible and destroyed locally. Further guidelines for the storage of data containing personal data follow below.  \\n\\nHandling data containing personal data  \\n\\nLegal requirements laid down in the GDPR apply to the processing of personal data. Researchers attached to the Faculty of Humanities must therefore process personal data in accordance with the requirements laid down in the GDPR, and in accordance with the requirements laid down by Utrecht University and the Faculty of Humanities. In general, this means that6:  \\n\\no Before creating a data collection, the researcher must carry out data classification and a DPIA, supported by the faculty data manager or otherwise.7   \\no Limit: only the personal data required for the research are collected. If, prior to the research, the purpose for which personal data are used to answer a research question is not clear, those personal data should not be collected.   \\no Separate: directly identifiable personal data must be separated from the other data and replaced by pseudo codes as soon as possible. Files in which the directly identifiable personal data and the corresponding pseudo codes are recorded, the ‘key files’, must be separated from the other research data.   \\no Inform: as far as is possible, the persons concerned will be informed of the research and requested to grant permission for use of their data.   \\no Provide control: as far as is possible and/or reasonable, research subjects will be given the opportunity to inspect their data, correct their data or withdraw from the research.   \\no Render unidentifiable: data containing personal data are archived only after anonymisation so that the data cannot be directly traced back to individuals. Anonymisation can be carried out using aggregations, or pseudo codes to replace the personal data.   \\no Hide: data containing personal data must be stored in locations with encryption.   \\no The storage or transmission of such data outside the European Economic Area is not permitted.   \\no Data containing personal data may only be exchanged with third parties provided that explicit agreements (transfer or processing agreements)8 have been concluded for that purpose. As soon as (a version of) the data form the basis for a scientific claim expressed in a scientific publication, for instance, the data concerned are packaged together in a data package, archived and published.   \\nThe data package contains, to the extent possible, all the necessary data, descriptions, scripts and images in order to: o reproduce the research results;   \\no retrieve the origin of the data;   \\no understand the collection method;   \\no identify the staff involved in creating the data package;   \\no understand the objective of the research;   \\no know the conditions for reusing the data;   \\no know the minimum storage duration.  \\n\\nDepending on the archive, repository or storage environment selected, the researcher can include most of the above information in the standard metadata forms currently available.

The Faculty of Humanities’ preferred user licence is Creative Commons Attribution/Share Alike 4.0.10 Where possible, the original (primary/rough) data must be archived, together with the scripts used to transform and analyse the data.   \\nFor maintenance purposes and to ensure long-term accessibility, data files should be archived in ‘sustainable’ file formats, where possible. The Faculty of Humanities uses the DANS list for this purpose.11   \\nAll individuals whose names are recorded in the data package are also identified by a persistent identifier in addition to their first and surname. The Faculty of Humanities uses ORCID as the identifier for individuals12.   \\nIn principle, data are archived for a period (the retention period) of at least ten years in a data package.   \\nIf data have been archived in YODA, the faculty independently decides at the end of the retention period whether the data should be archived for a longer period and at which location.   \\nAfter the data have been archived in a data package, the metadata of the package are published (in other words the metadata are distributed) and the data package is assigned a unique identifier.

TU Delft Research Data Framework Policy should be consulted about the roles of the Library, ICT Department, University Services and the Executive Board at TU Delft.  \\n\\nThis Policy is motivated by the belief that good data stewardship leads to research that is more time- and cost-efficient and it is inspired by principles that research data should be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR).',\n",
       " 'This policy cultivates:  \\n\\n: Best practice for ensuring that scientific arguments and results are reproducible in   \\nthe long term.   \\n: Better exposure of academic work of researchers at TU Delft leading to recognition of quality of the research process as a whole.   \\n: Responsible management of research data, including the safe storage of research data and protection of intellectual capital developed by scientists across TU Delft.   \\n: Improved practices for meeting the demands of funders and publishers with respect to research data management and sharing.',\n",
       " 'This policy recognises that:  \\n\\n: Individual departments and research groups have different working practices and processes and will therefore require dedicated guidelines – this document focuses on the aspects of research data management applicable to all departments. : Data management is the entire process of managing research data from its creation to its re-use and preservation and it is not equal to Open Science. While it is beneficial to publish research data openly, there might be valid ethical, legal or commercial implications, which will make data unsuitable for open sharing. . \"Relevant research data\" might mean different things in different disciplines. Source code, experimental notes, protocols, models, and other forms of information supporting traditional publication are also within the scope of this policy.  \\n\\nThe policy is applicable to all researchers of the faculty (PhD students, postdocs, researchers and project leaders). However, the research activities of students, such as bachelor and master students’ projects, are out the scope of this policy. In such cases, we encourage students and supervisors to follow the principles of this policy, but this does not constitute a requirement.',\n",

Freie Universität Berlin supports its members (researchers, instructors, and students) in implementing the relevant principles in alignment with the German Research Foundation’s Guidelines on the Handling of Research Data1 and Guidelines for Safeguarding Good Research Practice,2 Freie Universität Berlin’s Statute for Safeguarding Good Scientific Practice,3 Freie Universität Berlin’s Open Access Policy,4 the FAIR Data Principles\\u20095 as well as other recommendations6 regarding the entire research process, from data collection to the publication of research findings. Above and beyond these basic principles, Freie Universität Berlin believes that in the long term, research data are useful not only in a scientific context, but also have the potential to be used and distributed throughout society in accordance with the principles of open research (open science, open scholarship). The university encourages a culture of dialogue as a basis for developing quality assurance concepts for research data in the various departments and subject areas.  \\n\\n## 2 Scope  \\n\\nThis policy applies to all members of Freie Universität Berlin\\u20097 as well as to visiting researchers and guest lecturers, and partners and institutions with which the university holds a cooperation agreement. Where specific funding agreements with external funders stipulate other rules on data management, those rules take precedence. The binding policies of Freie Universität on data protection\\u20098 and IT security\\u20099 also apply.  \\n\\n## 3 Definition  \\n\\nThis policy applies to all research-related analog data, documents, and objects that are to be digitized in the course of a given research process as well as to “born digital” (i.e., originally created in a digital medium) data, documents, and objects produced in the course of a research process and/or that are the object or result of such a process. Research data are also defined as any data that facilitate the documentation, transparency, and – depending on the research area – replication of research outcomes (metadata).10  \\n\\nCommon examples of such research data are digitizations, audiovisual data, digital representations of analog data, measurement data, observation data, survey data, texts and text editions, databases, object collections, protocols, methodological test procedures, questionnaires, software, and simulations.11 The German Research Foundation (DFG) also defines source code and software as research data where they represent central outcomes of scientific research.12 The broad spectrum of data types reflects the diversity of scientific disciplines and their different research methods and processes.  \\n\\nIn the course of the research process, research data can take on several forms. They may vary in quality depending on how they are prepared or if additional data are added. The form of the data may also depend on the stage of processing, or they may be provided in different formats for presentation purposes. Furthermore, they may be subject to varying access regulations (open data, restricted data, closed data).  \\n\\nThe management of research data is an ongoing part of the entire research process. It includes the organization, documentation, storage, back-up, archiving, sharing, and publication of data. Research data management not only increases the visibility of the generated and/or processed data, but also the related research. It also helps to improve data quality and data processing, while making subsequent use of the data easier both for the original researchers and for others. Moreover, it facilitates the use of data in new contexts created when different data sets are linked. Sustainable research data management ensures the fulfillment of subject-specific requirements, as well as potential obligations related to funding agreements. It also helps meet publishers’ standards and requirements, as well as ensuring compliance with the principles of good scientific practice.  \\n\\n## 4 Handling Research Data  \\n\\nFreie Universität Berlin encourages researchers to structure and archive their research data and to make these accessible in accordance with the FAIR principles. These principles aim to make digital data more findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. Research data should be managed in a way that is compatible with the relevant subject-specific practices, with the principles of ethical research,\\u200913 and the guidelines and recommendations issued by professional associations in the relevant subject.14 Freie Universität Berlin adheres to the principles of the “Sorbonne Declaration on Research Data Rights,”\\u200915 and recommends that researchers work on the guiding principle of “as open as possible, as closed as necessary.”  \\n\\n### 4.1 Research and Project Planning; Administering and Managing Research Data  \\n\\nIt is recommended that project leaders include the costs of resources required to store and manage data (staff costs, project-specific hardware and software, charges for use) in grant applications. Even if funding institutions do not require it, Freie Universität Berlin recommends that researchers create a data management plan (DMP) as early as possible. The DMP should include details on how data will be collected, administered, secured, stored, used, and published. It should also include an agreement on data organization, the assignment of responsibilities, intellectual property,16 regulations regarding staff fluctuation, as well as specifications on data access. The data management plan should be reviewed regularly in the course of the research project and updated whenever necessary.  \\n\\nDescriptive metadata should be linked to the research data on an ongoing basis as an integrated part of the research project rather than waiting until the project is completed. It is also essential that the methods and tools used to generate, enrich, structure, and analyze the data are documented in full. This ensures compliance with quality standards, helps to keep the process transparent, and also ensures that the research can be replicated in accordance with the respective subject-specific norms. The University Library can help with choosing suitable tools for this process.  \\n\\n### 4.2\\t Publishing, Licensing, Storing, and Archiving Research Data  \\n\\nMachine-readable, processable research data can be deposited, referenced, and made accessible in different repositories. Depending on the project, researchers might choose a domain-specific repository, a subject-specific repository, or Freie Universität’s own institutional repository, “Refubium.”17  \\n\\nWhere intellectual property or data protection legislation or the principles of ethical research require restricting access to research data, Freie Universität offers technical archiving solutions.\\u200918 If there are reasons why research-relevant data are not to be stored, this should be documented in accordance with the recommendations on good scientific practice. If the research data are archived but not published, Freie Universität recommends that the metadata are deposited in Refubium to ensure the maximum visibility and long-term citability of research outcomes.  \\n\\nThe University Library assists members of the university in documenting and cataloguing their data for publication\\u200919 and in using sustainable and/or open standard formats',\n",
       " 'If usage or publication rights are to be transferred, use of the data for academic purposes should be guaranteed on a perpetual basis. Freie Universität Berlin therefore recommends granting open licenses for use when data (including their metadata) are published, e.g., CC0 or CC BY\\u200921 for data, GNU General Public License\\u200922 or MIT License\\u200923 for source code. Data should be assigned persistent identifiers, e.g., Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs).  \\n\\nThe University Library offers this service free of charge.\\u200924 For the citation and/or referencing of data\\u200925 and software\\u200926, researchers should refer to established standards.  \\n\\nResearch data must be stored and made accessible for as long as required and possible according to the recommendations and rules of research funders within the framework of statutory and legal provisions (e.g., the EU regulations on personal data [GDPR], intellectual property law). The minimum time for which research data should be stored is usually ten years from the date of publication of the data or the relevant work and/or the end of the project.\\u200927 Freie Universität’s institutional storage systems (ZEDAT; Refubium) ensure that data are stored for at least this long.  \\n\\nIf research data are to be deleted from the institutional storage systems, then this must be done in agreement with the relevant researchers as well as the infrastructure providers (i.e., the University Library and ZEDAT) following the expiry of the required archiving period and in compliance with all legal and ethical requirements. The decision as to whether to retain or delete the data should take into account the interests and contractual obligations of external funders and/or other stakeholders, such as cooperation partners, participating research institutions, etc.  \\n\\n## 5 Legal and Ethical Considerations  \\n\\nResearch data management must always and at all times take into account the current statutory requirements, especially in relation to the protection of individuals and of intellectual property (copyright law, General Data Protection Regulation), as well as the requirements of this policy, subject to special arrangements with third parties (e.g., research groups, joint projects) and to ethical considerations.  \\n\\nThe ownership of usage rights is regulated in the employment contract between the researcher and Freie Universität and/or other specific agreements with the researcher. The rules stipulated in other agreements (funding agreements, cooperation agreements, research permissions) and the rights and standards applicable to the persons and groups, if any, who form the object of the research also apply. It may be necessary to carry out individual assessments of cases where ownership of the intellectual property in relation to the data is vested solely in the researcher(s) and/or specific research institutions.  \\n\\n## 6 Responsibilities  \\n\\n### 6.1 Research and Teaching  \\n\\nMembers of Freie Universität Berlin are bound by the principles of good research practice set out by the German Research Foundation (DFG). Freie Universität’s statute on safeguarding good scientific practice\\u200928 stipulates that researchers must ensure that the research data created and processed in the context of their research project must be, wherever possible, organized, documented, made accessible, and stored in a long-term and sustainable way. The researchers at Freie Universität are responsible for implementing the various rules and guidelines that apply to their research, including rules and standards issued by their respective departments and in consideration of all ethical and statutory requirements.29  Proper handling of research data is also highly relevant in the context of teaching and education. Members of Freie Universität do their best to ensure students and researchers for whom they have a responsibility are aware of the various methods of research data management applicable to their respective subjects\\u200930, whether this is in teaching and training (especially research-oriented teaching), research-based internships, projects, or final theses.  \\n\\n### 6.2 Institutional Obligations  \\n\\nThe University Library provides consultations on the organizational, legal, and ethical aspects of research data management, as well as on questions related to information science in this context. It offers support to researchers, especially in designing a research data management plan, and in selecting and implementing the best archiving and, where applicable, publishing strategy. Where researchers are dealing with more complex requirements, the Office of the General Counsel, the Central Ethics Committee, and ZEDAT also offer advice on finding tailored solutions for specific legal, ethical, and technical issues. The University Library also supports researchers through training in basic skills and norms in relation to research data management. It can advise the departments and other units in setting up and developing their own training programs, e.g., for Collaborative Research Centers (CRCs). ZEDAT offers one-on-one consultations for researchers along with workshops for small or large working groups on subjects such as computation for scientists, finding the right software, and identifying capacity needs, for example, for big data projects',\n",
       " 'The Open Access Policy of Freie Universität Berlin\\u200932 encourages the idea that publishable research data should be accessible, and the university supports all researchers in making this possible as well as supporting recognition for data publications and developed software. The university strongly recommends that researchers consider and implement the relevant practices when handling research data in the context of assessing final theses and dissertations, in evaluations, and recruitment and appointment procedures. Freie Universität Berlin is also working toward the establishment of research data management as a core aspect of the curricula in all subject areas and in the courses offered by the central facilities as part of its endeavors to embed good scientific practice in all areas of the university.  \\n\\n## 7 Entry into Force  \\n\\nThis policy was approved by the Academic Senate of Freie Universität Berlin on May 5, 2021, and thereby entered into force.  \\n\\nThe University Library will be responsible for coordinating a review of this policy every two years with the participating central offices and committees to evaluate its validity in order to adapt it to new challenges, developments in infrastructure, and the needs of researchers.  \\n\\nCompliance with statutory and regulatory norms (including data protection legislation) is regularly monitored.  \\n\\nThe University Library is the point of contact for any questions related to this policy (forschungsdaten@fu-berlin.de).  \\n\\n## 8 References  \\n\\n‘§ 43 Mitglieder der Hochschule’.',\n",

       " 'Guidelines and recommendations on research data management at the Friedrich Schiller University Jena  \\n\\n20 december 2016  \\n\\n# Preface  \\n\\nAt the Friedrich Schiller University Jena (FSU) research data are regarded an essential resource for gaining scientific insights. The FSU strives to support its members with suitable research data management services. These services are provided by the central service facilities and will be continuously evaluated and enhanced.  \\n\\nThe present guidelines and recommendations supplement and specify the principles formulated in the \"Policy on the handling of research data at the Friedrich Schiller University Jena\". The Research Data Management Helpdesk serves as a central point of contact for all matters relating to research data. The website of the helpdesk1 provides the most recent information.  \\n\\n## I. Planning phase: before the research project  \\n\\nWhile planning a research activity in which data are collected or where data form the basis of your research, it is highly recommended to examine the requirements and possibilities for efficient and sustainable research data management from early on. The Research Data Management Helpdesk is there to assist you in determining your individual requirements, find out about services and funding opportunities, and to develop a suitable strategy for your project.  \\n\\nThe Service center for research and transfer2 provides general advice on proposals for third-party funding. Coordinated programs of the DFG (e.g. SFBs, research groups) are supported by the office of the Vice-President for Research',\n",
       " 'It is recommended, and also required by some funding organisations, to create and submit a data management plan (DMP). A DMP contains the requirements as well as the technical and organisational measures ensuring a sustainable handling of research data during, and after, the project life-time. Throughout a project the DMP serves as a reference and guideline. It may evolve over time if conditions or requirements change (keyword: living document).  \\n\\nMost funding organisations expect not only the long-term safekeeping of research data but also its publication. A suitable strategy should be determined in the proposal phase. Costs for research data management (e.g. labour, storage, publication), which cannot be covered by the university\\'s basic facilities, should be requested in the proposal. The university computer centre assists you in determining the necessary IT infrastructure and services.  \\n\\nWhile planning a research project, in particular, when publishing results, legal constraints apply and must be taken into account. Certain research data in the social sciences, life sciences and medicine, for example, are subject to strict conditions, such as privacy protection laws or require prior assessment by an ethics committee. Additionally, the protection of copyrights and legitimate interests of third parties must be ensured. It is recommended to clarify legal questions in advance while planning a research project. The legal department4 is there to advise you on these matters.  \\n\\n## II. Implementation phase: during the research project  \\n\\nStoring and processing, as well as collaborating on research data, should adhere to state-of-the-art IT principles. This includes, first and foremost, securing data in terms of accessibility, integrity (unaltered) and authenticity. For example, procedures for data backups and archiving need to be in place and secure data exchange platforms and versioning tools should be used.  \\n\\nIn terms of research data the university computer centre (URZ)5 provides (among other things) the following services. The services are offered partly free of charge as basic infrastructure or can be provided at net cost.  \\n\\nuse of network file systems (including data backup)   \\nmass storage (archive storage) including data mirroring   \\nrenting virtual servers (server hosting)   \\naccommodation of real servers (server housing)   \\nblock storage services for servers (virtual disks via a dedicated storage   \\nnetwork)   \\ndata exchange services   \\nversioning services   \\nlong-term archiving services (in cooperation with ThULB)  \\n\\nDetailed service descriptions are available on the URZ website.  \\n\\nThe reusability of research data is largely dependent on the availability and quality of accompanying metadata. Metadata is data about data and provides the context in which the data were created. As a rule of thumb, metadata should answer the classic six questions: Who? What? Why? How? When? Where? Metadata is a prerequisite enabling potential users to find data and assess its suitability for the intended use. Ideally, the description is structured and machine-readable. For this purpose, metadata standards and standardized terminologies exist in most disciplines. If these do not exist, generic standards, such as Dublin Core, MARC, or MODS, should be used.  \\n\\nIn the implementation phase of a project, datasets may evolve over several stages (e.g. by selection, aggregation, integration). It is good practice to label, document and keep the different versions at least for the duration of the project. Especially in the case of text-based data, the use of versioning tools (e.g. git, SVN) helps with the management of different versions.  \\n\\nIn collaborative projects or projects with large amounts of data, the use of dedicated software and infrastructure for data management is advisable. Operating these infrastructures usually requires additional resources, but they provide the advantage of a streamlined central management for research data. Finding and sharing research data is thereby facilitated, but should be governed by a data policy the project consortium agreed upon.  \\n\\n## III. Final phase: after completion of the research project  \\n\\nAccording to good scientific practice, research data must be archived and made available by the end of a project. In particular, public access has become a necessity in recent years in order to facilitate the traceability of research results as well as subsequent reuse of the data. It is recommended to publish research data following the principle \"as open as possible, as restricted as necessary\".  \\n\\nThere are various ways to publish research data. In addition to domain-agnostic repositories, a large number of discipline-specific repositories exist. To find a suitable repository for your research data, the portal re3data.org 6  provides extensive search and filter capabilities. In addition, there are special data journals for publishing research data. In some disciplines it is common practice to publish data as a supplement to the respective article. However, this form of data publication has the disadvantage that the data can only be found via the article and does not form an independent, citable publication object  \\n\\nWhen selecting a publication method, the following criteria should be taken into account: long-term availability (at least 10 years), allocation of persistent identifiers (e.g. DOI, URN), licensing and usage terms of the data, visibility and cost.  \\n\\nAs a member of the FSU, you may publish and archive research data with the Digital Library of Thuringia (DBT)',\n",
       " 'If you published research data with an external repository, you are requested to register this publication with the Digital Library Thuringia, too.  \\n\\nIndividual websites (e.g. of projects, departments, employees) are generally not suitable for the publication of research data. The long-term availability of such websites is often not guaranteed and non-ambiguous identification (keyword: PID) and cross-referencing is limited.  \\n\\nWhen selecting the data to be published, the DFG (2015) recommends, \"Data should be made accessible at a stage of processing that allows it to be usefully reused by third parties (raw data or structured data).\" In particular, data that served as the foundation of a scientific article should be made public.  \\n\\nAs with scientific articles, research data should also receive a unique, persistent identifier (PID). A PID (e.g. DOI, URN) is typically provided by the repository or data journal at the time of publication. In order to mandate usage and exploitation rights of your research data, data should always be published with a corresponding license. The selected license should allow at least open access for scientific purposes. Specific requirements of the funding organisation or repositories may apply and need to be considered. Suitable data licenses are available from Open Data Commons8 or the Creative Commons',\n",
       " 'In general, research data should be published as soon as possible. However, there may be reasons to publish research data with an embargo period. In this case, the data is submitted to the repository for archiving, but it is only accessible after the end of the embargo period. The researchers who are responsible for the data determine the length of the embargo period, unless otherwise requested by the policies and guidelines of funding organisations or the repositories. Embargo periods should not exceed 1-2 years after the end of the project.  \\n\\nVorstehende Handlungsempfehlung wurde am',\n",

Hasselt University sees to the quality of the research performed within the institution and by researchers affiliated to the institution. It has already undertaken various initiatives to warrant such high-quality and responsible research, e.g. by subscribing to the Code of Ethics for Scientific Research in Belgium and the European Charter for Researchers, by establishing a Commission on Scientific Integrity, and by drawing up the Integrity Charter. In addition, research data turn out to be key to uphold high-quality research. By implementing a policy plan on research data management Hasselt University aims to manage its research data in the best manner possible.  \\n\\nThis policy plan on research data management at Hasselt University outlines the basic principles and general guidelines for the secure, findable, accessible and understandable preservation, for the management, the reuse (if possible) and the (public) sharing and archiving of research data at Hasselt University for the purpose of (re)use, verification or data collection. It lays down a general framework within which researchers, employees and students at Hasselt University manage their research data in a high-quality manner. These basic principles and general guidelines are based on both national and international developments in the field of research data management, and should be read together with the related regulations and guidelines, as listed in attachment 1 to this policy plan.',\n",
       " '1. Terminology  \\n\\nResearcher: refers to any natural person who is conducting scholarly and/or academic research and is registered at Hasselt University, both paid and unpaid, and including doctoral students.  \\n\\nStudent: refers to any student who is attending a bachelor or master programme, a preparatory or bridging course, an advanced master, a teacher training or postgraduate certificate programme, an internship, an exchange study programme or credit contract at Hasselt University.  \\n\\nHierarchical responsible: depends on the statute of the researcher and his/her position within the research and organizational structure of Hasselt University. The hierarchy can be described as follows:  \\n\\nAcademic staff members (AAP, BAP [PhD], ZAP) < PI research group / director research institute < Dean < Vice-Rector Research < Rector   \\nAdministrative and technical staff members (ATP) < Coordinator unit < Director < ViceRector or Administrator < Rector   \\nStudent < (co-)Supervisor < PI research group / director research institute < Dean < ViceRector Research < Rector  \\n\\nResearch data: refers to all data and objects – whatever their form or method – that are generated, collected or used in the context of any research project. As a result, this broad definition includes a wide array of types and formats of data, ranging from raw data to processed and even published data. It may refer to both digital and physical data, and to data generated by the researcher himself /herself (primary data) as well as to data obtained from third parties (secondary data).  \\n\\nExamples may include, but are not limited to: notes, surveys, figures, objects, audio-visual files, spreadsheets, databases, statistical data, geographical data, research software, simulations, samples (including biological material, personal data, patient data, etc.).  \\n\\nMetadata: refers to data that describe the characteristics of the actual research data as to be able to identify and retrieve the latter more efficiently, that reflect the structure and composition of the research data and that facilitate the management of research data.  \\n\\nFor example, the title of a dataset, the names and affiliations of the researchers involved, a persistent identifier, version number, the relationship with an existing research project or scholarly publication, the date of creation, the file format, the access rights, etc.  \\n\\nHigh-quality research data: research data are deemed to be high-quality, when they are accurate, complete, authentic, reliable, understandable, identifiable, documented, findable, accessible, securely stored and secured.  \\n\\nAnonymous (anonymized) research data: refers to research data that don’t relate to an identified or identifiable natural person or to personal data rendered anonymous in such a manner that the data subject is not or no longer identifiable.  \\n\\nPseudonymous (pseudonymized) research data: refers to personal data that are processed in such a manner that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organizational measures to ensure that the personal data are not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person.  \\n\\nPersonal data: refers to any information relating to an identified or (in)directly identifiable natural person. Examples include, without being limited to: name, address, telephone number, chassis number, email address, IP address, age, gender, origin, image, way of life, personal opinions, etc. Each researcher collecting and/or processing personal data, must comply with the regulations concerning the protection of personal data.  \\n\\nSpecial categories of personal data: refers to particular personal data that are more sensitive by nature. Examples include, without being limited to: personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health (including medical information), data concerning a natural person’s sex life or sexual orientation, and data relating to criminal convictions and offences.  \\n\\nRecord of processing activities: each controller and, where applicable, the controller’s representative, shall maintain a record of processing activities under its responsibility. Art. 30 GDPR lays down the information that this record should contain.  \\n\\nData minimization: refers to the fact that personal data shall be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed. As a result, researchers should, as far as possible, only process personal data that are necessary for their specified research purposes.  \\n\\nData Protection Officer (DPO): (s)he is a staff member of Hasselt University and is designated to supervise the processing of personal data on behalf of Hasselt University. The Data Protection Officer (DPO) monitors implementation of and compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation within Hasselt University.  \\n\\nConfidential research data: refers to research data that need to be treated confidentially on account of a third party (internal/external) agreement.  \\n\\nInventions: refers to research results, as described in article IV.48.§1 of the Codex Hoger Onderwijs. That is to say potentially patentable findings, breeding products, designs and models, topographies of solid-state products, computer programmes and databases that could be used for commercial purposes when being applied in industry or agriculture.  \\n\\nOpen data: refers to research data that can be freely (re)used and shared by anyone, subject to the requirements of attribution and share-alike.  \\n\\nStorage: refers to the recording of research data during the research (project).  \\n\\nPreservation: refers to the recording of research data after the end of the research (project). Longterm preservation, in addition, refers to the recording of research data beyond a certain period (e.g. five years) after the end of a research (project).',\n",

During the entire research data life cycle, each researcher at Hasselt University must store, preserve and manage his/her high-quality data, and make them as (publicly) available as possible for potential reuse. In addition, research data must be managed as required by third parties, including funders, collaborating partners and government agencies. Each researcher at Hasselt University must observe and implement the basic principles and general guidelines, as set forth in this policy plan on research data management, before, during and after each scholarly research project.   \\n2. This policy plan on research data management complements existing legislation and regulations, and further specifies contractual obligations, research ethics and integrity guidelines. Personal data can only be collected and used when essential for a specific research question.   \\n4. All research projects require a data management plan (see art. 6).   \\n5. Researchers must comply with the current guidelines regarding the correct use of his/her Hasselt University user account, as set forth in the Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). Access rights to certain data are granted following the Identity and Access Management (IAM) procedures. The premises and infrastructure of Hasselt University are only accessible for researchers and individuals with a valid access permission.',\n",

       " '1. Introduction  \\n\\nHelmholtz Zentrum München, Deutsches Forschungszentrum für Gesundheit und Umwelt GmbH (hereafter Helmholtz Munich) recognizes the fundamental importance of research data and encourages all scientists to apply the highest standards when handling these data within their projects (for the definition of \"research data\" see 8.1. 3). This implies that accurate and easily retrievable research data must be an integral part of any research project at the center so that it reflects the scientific culture of our research activities recognized in society and in the scientific community. A generally binding research data policy is not only necessary for the verification and validation of research results, but also forms the basic prerequisite for open, transparent and networked science (Open Science Policy).  \\n\\nDue to the dynamics of the use of new analytical instruments, research data from current and also from already completed projects can generate additional value for future scientific projects. However, this can only be realized and protected if the data obtained is already protected against loss during the course of the project and if it remains reusable for future projects thanks to its format, the link with corresponding metadata and the assignment of persistent identifiers (DOI). Securing the research data obtained at the center for subsequent use is an essential prerequisite for future innovative (meta)analyses, e.g. to gain new knowledge on the complex interactions between environmental factors and human health.',\n",
       " \"2. Aim of this Research Data Policy at Helmholtz Munich  \\n\\n• The aim of securing the research data obtained at the center so that it can be reused for future projects is being pursued in the knowledge that the center's material and financial resources are provided by the public sector. Therefore, the center feels obliged to use the research results obtained with the greatest possible potential for broad application in society.  \\n\\n• With the implementation of a generally applicable research data guideline, including appropriate regulations for standardization, maximum synergy effects should be achieved by creating the basis for linking data sets from different projects.  \\n\\n• In particular, the research data guidelines also ensure that the research data already obtained at the center can be reused for future scientific questions (1, 2).  \\n\\n• A generally applicable research data guideline for the Helmholtz Zentrum München facilitates cooperation with research institutions in Germany and abroad and increases the visibility of the center in the international science community through the principles of Open Science (2, 3).\",\n",

Scope of this Research Data Policy  \\n\\nThe following guideline for handling research data applies to all employees of the Helmholtz Zentrum München, regardless of how the respective research project is financed (basic funding or funding by grants). It is also used - within the framework of the respective contractual agreements - for research data that was / will be obtained in the context of cooperation with external partners.  \\n\\nAll employees of the center must follow this guideline when handling research data, regardless of the legal basis of their employment (as permanent researchers, employees on temporary projects, visiting scientists, scholarship holders, etc.).  \\n\\nThe Center's current guidelines on data protection and information security, as well as the guidelines on the storage of and access rights to research data, take precedence over this guideline. In particular, research data as carriers of intellectual property may require protection (IP guideline of the center). Your exploitation rights by the center or third-party donors have priority over their publication (see 8.1.6) and must not be jeopardized by an open data culture.  \\n\\nExceptions to the research data guidelines can only be granted in justified cases.

These metadata records contain descriptions of the data context in the long term and to publish them if necessary. Your archiving should be retrievable, readable, exchangeable and reusable according to the four premises of the FAIR data standard (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable) (4). The link to their metadata should be made using the established and standardized terminology of the relevant discipline, taking into account the possibility of interdisciplinary reusability and interoperability (5).  \\n\\nThe handling of research data within the framework of defined projects follows the DMP, which is created before the project begins (6). The planned type of research data, its acquisition, storage and access options to the data are to be specified in the DMP and the respective responsible parties are to be named. In the case of technical or methodological changes in the data flow during the course of a project, the DMP must be adapted. In the case of third-party funded projects, the costs incurred for the implementation of the DMP must be taken into account as eligible expenses when applying for funding.

This policy is addressed to all researchers at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin both in their role as independent researchers, and as teachers and supervisors. Their obligation includes instructing students and doctoral candidates about handling of research data properly, as well as imparting subject-specific skills and standards.  \\n\\n### What is research data?  \\n\\nResearch data means all data that was created in the course of research or results from it. Since the generation or collection of research data depends on a variety of research questions and methods, followed by processing, analysis and publishing and/or archiving, the data may involve a range of media, aggregation levels and formats. Sharing and reusing research data requires documentation about the original context and about tools that were used.  \\n\\n## Policy  \\n\\nTo further the Proposals for Safeguarding Good Scientific Practice of the German Research Foundation, and the Rules of the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin for Safeguarding Good Scientific Practice and Investigating Allegations of Scholarly Misconduct (Satzung der Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin zur Sicherung guter wissenschaftlicher Praxis und zum Umgang mit Vorwürfen wissenschaftlichen Fehlverhaltens, in German) the University adopts following policy:',\n",

       " 'I.    Introduction  \\n\\nIn March 2021, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) launched the Tri-Agency Research Data Management Policy. This policy seeks to support Canadian research excellence by promoting sound data management and data stewardship practices to ensure “that research makes good use of public funds, experiments and studies are replicable, and research data are available for reuse where ethical, legal, and commercial obligations allow.”1 The agencies recognize that standards for Research Data Management (RDM) vary across disciplines, areas of research, and modes of scientific and scholarly inquiry.  \\n\\nThe RDM Policy requires all postsecondary institutions and hospitals eligible to administer Tri-Agency funds to develop an institutional research data management (RDM) strategy that reflects the institution’s size, research intensity, and existing RDM capacity. Additionally, the Tri-Agency RDM Policy, establishes new data management requirements for researchers applying for federal funding. For  certain funding competitions, the agencies will require data management plans (DMPs) to be submitted during the application process. The quality of these plans will be considered in the merit review process. Further, after reviewing the institutional strategies and in step with the readiness of the Canadian research community, the agencies will phase in a data deposit requirement. The RDM policy acknowledges that “determining what counts as research data, and which data should be preserved, is often highly contextual and should be guided by disciplinary norms.”2',\n",
       " 'II.   Importance of Research Data Management  \\n\\nRDM enables researchers to organize, store, access, reuse and build upon digital research data. RDM is essential to Canadian researchers’ capacity to securely preserve and use their research data throughout their research projects, reuse their data over the course of their careers and, when appropriate, share their data. Furthermore, as an acknowledged component of research excellence, strong RDM practices support researchers in achieving scientific rigor and enable collaboration in their fields (Tri-Agency Research Data Management Policy - Frequently Asked Questions).',\n",
       " 'III.   Institutional Context  \\n\\nHuron University College’s RDM strategy reflects its current research activities, intensity, and context as a small undergraduate liberal arts university, affiliated with a large research-intensive university. Research and research-learning are vital to the culture and mission of Huron University. Huron is committed to research excellence and recognizes that strong research data management is a key component of research excellence.  \\n\\nData management planning and the new Tri-Agency requirements represent a significant change for Huron researchers and for the institution. We are in the early stages of creating the supports and awareness necessary to foster a culture of research data management. Huron recognizes data as an important research output and is committed to promoting responsible RDM that will enable our researchers to establish and implement RDM practices most appropriate to their disciplinary context.  \\n\\nHuron will support researchers in adopting the FAIR Principles to make research data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. The FAIR principles are complemented by Tri-Agency Framework: Responsible Conduct of Research and the TCPS 2 (2022), which provides guidance on data management in areas of consent, privacy and confidentiality, and secondary use of data.',\n",
       " 'IV.   Indigenous Data Considerations  \\n\\nHuron is committed to decolonizing our curriculum, practices, and relationships with the Indigenous peoples of Canada and particularly of southwestern Ontario. This includes research conducted in partnership with First Nations, Métis and Inuit communities, collectives, and organizations. Huron recognizes that Indigenous communities themselves must “guide and ultimately determine how the data are collected, used and preserved, and have the right to repatriate the data.”3 Huron is committed to working in partnership with Indigenous stakeholders to implement a distinctions-based approach to ensure that the unique rights, interests, and circumstances of First Nations, Métis, and Inuit peoples are acknowledged, affirmed, and implemented  \\n\\nHuron supports the use of data management practices, such as the First Nations Principles of OCAP® (Ownership, Control, Access, Possession), and the CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance (Collective benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, Ethics), to support Indigenous data sovereignty. In addition, Chapter 9 of the TCPS 2 (2022) details considerations in research with Indigenous Peoples. Huron’s Indigenous Initiatives Coordinator is a key resource in ensuring appropriate and meaningful application of RDM principles and strategies to Indigenous data.',\n",
       " 'V.   Ethics Considerations  \\n\\nResearch projects involving human participants are reviewed by Huron’s Research Ethics Board. The REB has recently incorporated research data management in the application form for ethics approval.',\n",
       " 'VI.  Scope  \\n\\nThis strategy applies to all faculty, staff, and students who conduct research at Huron. It also applies to any person (including, but not limited to, affiliated faculty, visiting professors or students, adjunct professors and postdoctoral associates and fellows) appointed or invited to engage in research activity at, or under the auspices of, Huron.4',\n",
       " 'VII.  Oversight and Review  \\n\\nThe Office of the Provost, with support from the Coordinator, Research & Learning, is responsible for the development and implementation of the RDM strategy. As a living document, the RDM strategy will be revised on an ongoing basis in consultation with Huron researchers, Library and Learning Services, Information Technology Services, the Research Ethics Board, and other institutional stakeholders.',\n",
       " 'VIII.   Institutional Strategy  \\n\\nHuron wishes to foster a research data management culture where researchers are aware of data management planning tools, repositories, and resources and incorporate them throughout the research lifecycle. Our initial priorities are to increase awareness, support, and capacity for RDM practices, while leveraging, where appropriate, RDM resources available through Western University, the Digital Research Alliance of Canada (formerly Portage) and other organizations.',\n",
       " 'Objective 1: Build RDM Awareness and Institutional Capacity  \\n\\nPromote the value and importance of data management   \\nIncrease awareness of the new Tri-Agency RDM requirements and the Tri-Agency Statement of   \\nPrinciples on Digital Data Management   \\nSurvey the Huron research community to evaluate current RDM practices, gaps, and capacity   \\nIdentify needs for data storage, data deposit, and data security   \\nDevelop and implement an institutional framework to support RDM',\n",
       " 'Objective 2: Provide RDM Support and Training  \\n\\nDevelop a repository of resources focused on RDM needs in the social sciences and humanities Offer RDM workshops, Lunch and Learns, and other training opportunities Provide researchers with guidance to manage their data in accordance RDM best practices, including the development of data management plans for funding applications Increase awareness of RDM resources and training available through the Digital Research Alliance of Canada and Western Libraries, including the DMP Assistant and Borealis, the Canadian Dataverse Repository',\n",
       " 'Objective 3: Support Indigenous Data Sovereignty  \\n\\nIncrease awareness of Indigenous data sovereignty, including the OCAP® and CARE principles Provide resources and training to support researchers in working responsibly with Indigenous partners and communities Collaborate with the Indigenous Initiatives Coordinator and Indigenous elders, knowledge keepers and communities to ensure that data are managed in close partnership with Indigenous communities',\n",
       " 'IX.   Looking Ahead  \\n\\nHuron’s largest faculty, the Faculty of Arts and Social Science is about to launch a strategic planning exercise to develop its next five-year Academic Plan (2024-2029). The Faculty of Theology will embark on a similar process next year. It is anticipated that our institutional RDM strategy over the next five years will be informed by this work.',\n",

       " 'Research Data  \\n\\nResearch data are data that are used as primary sources to support technical or scientific enquiry, research, scholarship, or creative practice, and that are used as evidence in the research process and/or are commonly accepted in the research community as necessary to validate research findings and results. Research data may be experimental data, observational data, operational data, third party data, public sector data, monitoring data, processed data, or repurposed data. What is considered relevant research data is often highly contextual and determining what counts as such should be guided by disciplinary norms (Tri-Agency Research Data Management Policy - Frequently Asked Questions).',\n",
       " 'Research Data Management  \\n\\nResearch data management (RDM) refers to the processes applied through the lifecycle of a research project to guide the collection, documentation, storage, sharing and preservation of research data. RDM is essential throughout the data lifecycle—from data creation, processing, analysis, preservation, storage and access, to sharing and reuse (where appropriate), at which point the cycle begins again. Data management should be practiced over the entire lifecycle of the data, including planning the investigation, conducting the research, backing up data as it is created and used, disseminating data, and preserving data for the long term after the research investigation has concluded (Tri-Agency Research Data Management Policy - Frequently Asked Questions).',\n",
       " 'Data Management Plan  \\n\\nA “data management plan” (DMP) is “a living document, typically associated with an individual research project or program that consists of the practices, processes and strategies that pertain to a set of specified topics related to data management and curation. DMPs should be modified throughout the course of a research project to reflect changes in project design, methods, or other considerations. DMPs guide researchers in articulating their plans for managing data; they do not necessarily compel researchers to manage data differently” (Tri-Agency Research Data Management Policy, Frequently Asked Questions, Government of Canada 2021).',\n",
       " 'Data Deposit  \\n\\n“Data deposit” refers to when the research data collected as part of a research project are transferred to a research data repository. The repository should have easily accessible policies describing deposit and user licenses, access control, preservation procedures, storage and backup practices, and sustainability and succession plans. The deposit of research data into appropriate repositories supports ongoing data-retention and, where appropriate, access to the data.

The College is developing services and guidance for its academic and research community in order to foster best practice in data management and to facilitate, by way of a robust digital curation infrastructure, free and timely open access to data so that they are intelligible, assessable and usable by others. The College acknowledges legal, ethical and commercial constraints with regard to sharing data and the need to preserve the academic entitlement to publication as the primary communication of research results.',\n",

       " 'Application:  \\n\\nThe aims in this document apply to all data generated through research undertaken by Imperial College staff and students solely or in collaboration with others.  This includes, but is not limited to, research sponsored by grants or contracts awarded to Imperial College and where Imperial is a partner on awards held by other institutions.  \\n\\nThis framework will aid Imperial’s transition to best practice in Research Data Management and to compliance with funders’ requirements.',\n",
       " '1.2 Aims  \\n\\nThe aim of this document is to provide a framework within which the College, through its academic and research community, and support services can adhere to the rules and mandates of its funding and regulatory bodies and to ensure that research data are maintained and preserved as identifiable, retrievable and reusable assets as part of the overall research project cycle.  This is achieved by allocating roles and responsibilities across the institution and will be reviewed once the College has finalised its analysis of requirements.  \\n\\nThis document supports academics retaining the choice of where to deposit their data and their entitlement to publish their findings first within the constraints specified by the funder (where one exists) though also taking account of the socioeconomic benefits of promptly sharing the outcomes of research.  \\n\\nManagement of data generated from a research grant or contract must also comply with the policies of the relevant grant funders.  Where these conflict with the College policy, the policies of the funders take precedence unless specified.  \\n\\nManagement of data obtained under licence must also comply with relevant licence agreements.

       " '3. PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES  \\n\\n3.1 Principal Investigators have overall responsibility for the effective management of research data generated within or obtained for their research, including by their research groups. The Library and ICT will provide training, guidance and services to support PIs in the following roles and responsibilities.  \\n\\n3.2 Principal Investigators will provide a data management plan (DMP) for all research grant and contract proposals from the date mandated by the funder where applicable, and in any case by 1st January 2016. This should be in the DMP format provided by the funder if one has been defined, and otherwise the College standard format2 should be used. See 5.1 and 5.2 for details of the support provided by the Library for this task.  \\n\\n3.3 During the course of a research project, the PI must ensure their own and their group’s data (and use reasonable endeavours to ensure their collaborators’ research data) are stored and described in ways that will minimise the risk of loss and maximise the likelihood of future discoverability and re-use.  \\n\\n3.3.1 Minimum standards of data safety to be followed are published by ICT3.  \\n\\n3.3.2 ICT will provide shared network storage that complies with these standards (see 6.1).  \\n\\n3.3.3 Research data are to be accompanied by adequate metadata and/or documentation to facilitate its identification and re-use. See 5.1 and 5.6 for details of the support provided by the Library for this task.  \\n\\nPrincipal Investigators are responsible for identifying and preserving all their research data (whether shareable or not) that would be required to validate published research findings in the future.  \\n\\nPrincipal Investigators are responsible for determining what their shareable research data comprises in view of the considerations in 3.6. The minimum requirement is to share all relevant data to support and underpin published findings including e-theses.  Any funder requirements must also be met.  \\n\\n.6 Principal Investigators must deposit their shareable research data in a publicly-available repository of their choosing no later than the time of publication of the findings.  Where the funder requires deposit earlier, the timeframes specified by the funder take precedence.  Where the funder requires the data to be deposited in a different repository, the funder’s requirements must also be followed although deposit in multiple repositories is acceptable.  \\n\\n3.6.1 Publication – the PI’s entitlement to be the first to publish based on data they have generated must be preserved.  If the PI will not be able to publish their findings by the funder’s deadline for data sharing, the PI should request an extension of the embargo period from the funder.   \\n3.6.2 Copyright – the PI will not share any data that would infringe any right of title or copyright. Where third party research data are used, access conditions should be sought and followed and the source of that data will be acknowledged where required.',\n",
       " 'RESEARCH DATA MANAGEMENT POLICY  \\n\\n3.6.3 Licences – the PI is entitled to select the licence under which they publish their data provided the chosen licence permits sharing and re-use in accordance with the appropriate funder’s terms and conditions (if any exist) and this policy.  \\n\\n3.6.3 Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) – the PI will not share any data that would infringe the IPR of others.  \\n\\n3.6.4 Commercial Interests – the PI is entitled to delay sharing of their data where early release may harm commercialisation opportunities arising from their research until appropriate protection is in place.  \\n\\n3.6.5 Privacy – the PI will take all appropriate steps to ensure the anonymity of any personal data prior to sharing.  For patient data, further requirements are detailed in “Data Protection Policy – Code of Practice 2: Handling of Patient Data”4 and must be met.  \\n\\n3.6.6 Ethical Concerns – the PI should bear in mind potential ethical considerations in making the decision to share their data.  \\n\\n3.6.7 Cost Effectiveness – where computer-generated data may be reliably recreated at a cost less than that of storing raw output data, then the inputs and human-readable outputs of the relevant programme may be stored instead along with a reference to or copy of the software version used.  \\n\\n3.6.8 Legal Safeguards – where data are shared with restrictions, e.g. if they identify human subjects, they would normally be stored in repositories located in the EU to prevent their full disclosure via Freedom of Information and Data Protection safeguards.  See 5.6 for details of the support provided by the Library for this task.  \\n\\n3.7 If software is developed as part of a research project, Principal Investigators must archive the particular version of the software used to generate or analyse the data in a repository and inform the Library of its location, taking account of the points raised in 3.5 above. Principal Investigators are encouraged to follow the Sustainability and Preservation Framework of the Software Sustainability Institute.5.  \\n\\nPrincipal Investigators will inform the Library of the location of their shared research data and specified metadata including the Digital Object Identifier (DOI) for that data package at the time of deposit.  \\n\\nPrincipal Investigators will ensure that all journal articles include a means to obtain the supporting data by referencing the appropriate DOI.  \\n\\n3.10 Appropriate funding for RDM should be requested at application stage where this is an eligible cost item allowed by the funder [TBC based on most effective means of covering these costs under FEC methodology].  \\n\\n.11 Principal Investigators will ensure that shareable research data are made publicly available for 10 years after publication or for the minimum period required by the funder if longer than 10 years.  \\n\\n3.12 If the PI leaves Imperial College or circumstances (such as death, incapacitation or leaving academia) mean the PI is no longer able to fulfil their responsibilities then:  \\n\\n3.12.1 If there is an Imperial College Co-Investigator, they inherit the responsibilities of the PI;  \\n\\n3.12.2 Otherwise, if the PI and the award move to another institution, the responsibilities follow the PI;  \\n\\n3.12.3 Otherwise, whom so ever is appointed by the department to complete any of the PI’s requirements for the research project will become the PI from an Imperial College perspective and as such inherit the responsibilities outlined in this section.',\n",

       " \"1. Introduction  \\n\\nThe Faculty of Geo-Information Science and Earth Observation (ITC) has committed to promoting open and transparent research practices. Proper Research Data Management (RDM) that is in accordance with FAIR data principles, i.e. ensuring findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable research data, is a key requirement to achieve this mission. Upholding the best research data management practices is essential for fostering efficient, reproducible, transparent, and highquality research.  \\n\\nBuilding upon the solid foundation provided by UT's overarching Research Data Management Policy, the policy outlined below provides tailored guidelines and the best practices specific to ITC.  \\n\\nThis ITC-specific policy is intended to ensure that all research data is handled with the utmost care by all ITC researchers and students in order to, among other things:  \\n\\nDemonstrate academic integrity, upholding transparency and ethical practices in research;   \\nSafeguard research data security and the privacy of research subjects;   \\nEnable research reproducibility, allowing for the verification and validation of academic findings;   \\nComply with relevant regulations, policies, and Code of Conduct regarding research data management, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), The Netherlands Code of Conduct for Research Integrity;   \\nEnsure the availability of data and facilitate the re-use of research data by the research community.\",\n",
       " '2. Scope of the policy  \\n\\nThis policy is intended for all members of ITC engaged in research activities, including master students and academic researchers (PhD candidates, postdoctoral fellows, researchers, and senior academic staff, i.e. assistant professors, associate professors, and full professors) and all other staff involved in the generation, collection, processing, and dissemination of research data. In accordance with UT’s RDM policy, it covers roles, responsibilities, and ITC’s working rules in accordance with the best RDM practices.  \\n\\nIn the subsequent sections, we will delve into specific aspects of RDM, including data management planning, data storage, data sharing and transfer, data documentation, preservation, and registration, and specific considerations regarding handling personal data in research. Each section will provide detailed working rules and information on the best practices for managing research data effectively.',\n",
       " '3. Definitions  \\n\\nResearch data: the term ‘research data’ refers to all forms of information, commonly accepted in the academic community, that is collected, observed, generated, or created as necessary to validate research findings and conclusions. Examples include geospatial and remote sensing data, statistics, field and laboratory measurements, experimental and observational data, surveys, interviews, video and audio recordings, photos and images, analysis scripts, etc. (Kruse & Thestrup, 2018). Research data also include secondary documents such as policy reports and data obtained from literature review. Research data do not include the following materials: drafts of academic papers, plans for future research, peer reviews, or communication with colleagues.  \\n\\nResearch project: In this policy, a research project refers to a detailed study of a subject aimed to solve specific research questions or objectives. It involves the collection, analysis, and interpretation of data in order to discover new facts or develop new concepts, generate new findings, and instigate progress. Research projects explicitly include research carried out by master students and academic researchers (PhD candidates, postdoctoral fellows, researchers and senior academic staff, i.e. assistant professors, associate professors, and full professors).  \\n\\nData management plan (DMP): A DMP is a formal document that describes all data that are to be used in the project, the documentation and organisation of data, data storage during the research process, preservation of data after the project is completed, and finally, the future availability of data for sharing and re-use. The DMP should also provide information on the planned measures to safeguard and protect sensitive data such as personal data (Berez-Kroeker et al., 2022).  \\n\\nMetadata: the term ‘metadata’ refers to structured information about data. Such information makes it easier to understand, discover, use, or manage data. It includes information such as the description of said data, their origin, temporal coverage, geographic location, creator, access conditions, and other descriptive elements (Riley, 2017).  \\n\\nPersonal data: In accordance with GDPR, the term ‘personal data’ refers to any information that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person, such as a name, an identification number, a geographical location, an online identifier, or one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person (European Union, 2016).  \\n\\nClassified data: the term ‘classified data’ refers to data that have been classified to a certain level of sensitivity, considering properties such as availability, integrity, and confidentiality, in order to decide the related level of security and protection measures.',\n",
       " '4. Roles and Responsibilities in Research Data Management  \\n\\nIn accordance with UT’s RDM policy, ITC identifies the following individual or (groups of) stakeholders and their responsibilities with regard to RDM:  \\n\\nThe Faculty Board is responsible for maintaining good RDM practices as part of the research vision within ITC. Therefore, the Faculty Board is accountable for the implementation of this faculty policy and facilitating that implementation by warranting the availability of infrastructure, tools, and research data management support and expertise, including the presence of a Faculty Data Steward, a Privacy Contact Person, an ICT account manager and an Ethics Committee.  \\n\\nHeads of academic departments are responsible for ensuring that all students in the specializations administered by their departments and all researchers are aware of the Faculty’s policy, and for stimulating them to acquire the necessary information and training to manage research data effectively.  \\n\\nAcademic researchers and students hold the primary responsibility for taking care of the data that they produce. They must warrant proper data management and adhere to the Faculty’s policy.  \\n\\nSupervisors/principal researchers and team leaders are directly responsible for making sure that researchers and students under their supervision are aware of the importance of good data management practices and adhere to the expectations outlined within this faculty policy. More specifically, they must warrant that the research projects under supervision have a DMP in place and that all data underlying the completed research are appropriately documented and preserved as outlined within this policy.',\n",
       " '5. Faculty Guidelines and Working Rules',\n",
       " '5.1 Data Management Planning  \\n\\nPlanning data management is essential for every research project and should be an integral part of good research design. Quality research starts with a good DMP. Therefore, for every research project conducted within ITC, a DMP must be written and regularly updated during the project.  \\n\\nMaster students must write a DMP for their research and include it in the documents required for the proposal. The DMP has to be reviewed by the supervisors as part of the proposal’s assessment. PhD candidates must follow a Data Management Bootcamp (1 ECTS) offered by UT to learn how to write a DMP for their PhD projects. The DMP must be written within the first year of their PhD trajectory, reviewed by the Faculty Data Steward, and included in the documents required for the PhD Qualifier. The DMP for a PhD project must be reviewed annually by the supervisors during the annual interview and updated where necessary. Any other research project must have a DMP before the start of the said project, but no later than four months after the start of the research, and it must be reviewed by the Faculty Data Steward. The DMP has to be reviewed regularly and updated where necessary and it must be adhered to by all research team members.  \\n\\nA DMP template is available at UT’s DMP-tool. The template has been accepted by the Dutch Research Council NWO, the independent governmental body Care Research NetherlandsMedical Sciences ZonMW, and the EU (e.g., the European Research Council ERC). Therefore, the UT DMP template should be used unless the funding body or their partners require the use of a different template.  \\n\\nFor support regarding writing a DMP, contact the Faculty Data Steward',\n",
       " '5.2 Data Storage  \\n\\nEffective research data management is essential for maintaining the accessibility and security of research data. This section outlines the best practices and guidelines for storing data during research. In principle, all research data collected and generated should be stored safely and protected against unauthorised access, accidental disclosure, and loss. The choice of storage facility depends on many factors, such as the type of data, size, the need for collaboration with research partners, etc.  \\n\\nA copy of key research data (key files of the data collected and generated) and the related materials (e.g. documentation, protocols, models, or questionnaires) must be stored in facilities offered by UT, unless exceptions apply.   \\nIn case researchers wish to use their own storage facilities for primary storage, note that UT has strict requirements when it comes to acquisition of research data storage. It is required to ensure that the storage facility is at least ISO 27001-certified and in the case of health data NEN 7510-certified. These two certificates prove that the way data, especially personal and privacy-sensitive data, are stored complies with current security standards. If you need advice regarding the storage certification, please contact the Faculty ICT Account Manager   \\nPortable devices (e.g., external hard drives, USB sticks, or personal laptops) should not be used as the primary storage facility of research data.   \\nNon-digital research data and related materials, such as physical samples, lab notebooks and printed informed consent forms, must be stored in accordance with clearly described procedures and standards within the research group and/or project and must be digitised where possible.  \\n\\nTake a look at the UT storage decision tree which provides an up-to-date overview of UT storage facilities and all other secure storage solutions offered by UT.  \\n\\nContact the Faculty Data Steward in case you have questions or need support.',\n",
       " \"5.3 Data Sharing and Transfer  \\n\\nData sharing refers to providing access to data in a way that maintains the data's availability, accessibility, and confidentiality. This section outlines the best practices and guidelines for data sharing with colleagues within or outside ITC during research.  \\n\\nStored research data should be accessible to at least one other member of the research team other than the main researcher, ideally the principal researcher or a daily supervisor for Postdocs, PhDs, and Master students. Access to the stored data by other research team members is vital to ensure data availability. For collaborative projects involving data sharing, a data sharing agreement, which establishes the terms and conditions under which data are shared and clarifies the roles and responsibilities of both parties regarding the management of the data, should be drawn up in consultation with the Faculty Privacy Contact Person and should be signed by the Faculty Dean prior to sharing research data with external parties.  \\n\\nThe UT storage decision tree also offers a range of facilities for data transfer and data   \\nsharing.   \\nThere are several types of data sharing agreements, depending on the research project and type of data:   \\no A data transfer agreement is generally used when sharing non-personal data with third parties;   \\no A joint controllership agreement is used to establish shared responsibilities regarding the processing of personal data with collaborators. Consortium agreements and Grant Agreements (e.g., Horizon 2020) provide a legal basis for this type of agreement;   \\no A data processing agreement is used when a third party is involved in the processing of personal data on behalf of the data controller (such as collecting, storing, or analysing the data on your behalf);   \\no A non-disclosure agreement is typically used for trade or commercial data, including trade secrets and patent-related data.\",\n",
       " '5.4 Data Documentation  \\n\\nData documentation is crucial to ensure that research data are understandable and re-usable by yourself or by others. In accordance with the FAIR principles,  as a minimum requirement a definite version of research data should be well documented. However, best practice is to start documenting data and record metadata early during the research process and to update these regularly throughout research in order to warrant completeness and accuracy.  \\n\\nResearch data, both digital and non-digital, should always be accompanied by metadata to ensure findability and re-usability. Research data must be accompanied by additional documentation (e.g., in the form of a README file, data paper, etc.) to enable correct interpretation and re-use. Clear, concise language and standard terminologies should be used to ensure comprehensibility.  \\n\\nResearch data must be accompanied by at least one set of metadata for the entire dataset. However, for comprehensive documentation, metadata should be provided for each distinct type of data or file where applicable or necessary.   \\nSince the data repositories provide machine-readable forms of metadata, most often based on a generic metadata standard such as Dublin Core, it is recommended to provide additional documentation in the form of a README file. This documentation should encompass, but not be limited to the data contents and structure, along with all relevant methodological information (e.g., the collection, processing, and quality control aspects of said data), records of different versions of the data files, and details on sharing and access.   \\nDiscipline-specific metadata standards (e.g., the ISO 19115 geographic information metadata standard) can be used to decide on additional information aimed at enhancing the data documentation.   \\nFor the local management of your research datasets and related metadata and for publishing them easily to different research data repositories, you can use the fairly toolset. This toolset includes a command line tool and a JupyterLab extension that facilitate creating, uploading, and downloading research datasets together with metadata without requiring programming skills.',\n",
       " \"5.5 Data Preservation  \\n\\nData preservation refers to the long-time storage of research data to enable the verification and reproduction of research and the re-use of data. Publishing and archiving data are the two most practical ways to preserve data after research.  \\n\\nDigital research data needed for verification and reproduction (at least those underlying all types of academic publications, such as journal articles, reports, theses, etc.) have to be preserved in one of ITC’s approved data repositories or archive facilities for at least ten years after completion of the project (in accordance with The Netherlands Code of Conduct for Academic Practice).   \\nPreserved in a repository, research data can be published publicly, with restricted access, or embargoed. In accordance with the ITC’s Open Science Strategic Plan, the data should be published as open as possible and as closed as necessary, i.e., in case of legitimate reasons, such as ethical reasons, reasons concerning privacy protection and national security reasons, knowledge safety and export control, confidentiality, commercial interest, legal and contractual obligations reasons. However, the metadata must always be made available publicly.   \\nDigital research data that cannot be shared with third parties, including trusted data repositories, must be archived in UT’s archive facility.   \\nResearch data underlying master's and PhD research projects must be preserved before graduation. Research data underlying other types of research projects must be preserved no later than one month after completion of the research project. Non-digital research data, wherever possible and appropriate, should be digitised. If the data is to be preserved in non-digital format, they should be stored securely in accordance with the respective department’s common practices.   \\nThe primary author and co-authors of academic publications share the responsibility of controlling access and making any decision with respect to the data and, therefore, should all be acknowledged in the metadata of the archived or published datasets as contact persons.   \\nFor research projects run by ITC researchers, access to the data with restricted access is controlled by the principal investigator. In situations where the original researchers are not available or no longer affiliated with ITC, access to the data is determined and granted by the department chair.   \\nArchived or published digital and non-digital research data require sufficient documentation to enable proper interpretation and re-use, as described in the section on Data Documentation.  \\n\\nFor publishing research data, UT and ITC recommend two trusted research data repositories: DANS and 4TU.ResearchData.  \\n\\nTrusted repositories are the repositories that have received a Core Trust Seal Certification, which warrants the reliability and durability of data repositories and, hence, the potential for storing data over a long period of time.  \\n\\nFor archiving research data, UT has a certified facility for long-term research data archiving known as AREDA. It is required to contact the Faculty Data Steward before archiving data in AREDA.   \\nFor archiving research data from master research projects, ITC has a separate archive facility.\",\n",
       " '5.6 Data Registration in PURE  \\n\\nThe registration of research output in Pure, including research data, is essential for consolidating information from various sources at one single platform in order to offer a comprehensive overview of ITC research activities and their impact.  \\n\\nAll archived or published digital and non-digital data must be registered in Pure (UT Research Information), where their metadata information is recorded to increase visibility.  \\n\\nStep-by-step guidelines, including a Demo and more guidance on registering research output, are available on the UT Research Information Website',\n",
       " '5.7 Personal, Confidential, and Classified Research Data Management  \\n\\nWarranting the protection of confidential data, privacy, and the rights of research subjects is paramount in all research activities conducted within ITC. This section outlines key principles, ctices, and compliance measures related to the handling of personal and confidential data in research:  \\n\\nAll research activities involving personal data must adhere to the principles and requirements outlined in the GDPR;   \\nResearchers should only collect the minimum amount of personal data necessary for research purposes. Collecting unnecessary or excessive personal data should be avoided; Researchers and students must report any processing of personal data through GDPR registration using the online UT DMP+GDPR tool;   \\nA Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA), i.e, risk assessment, should be carried out prior to processing any personal data likely to result in high risks to the rights and freedom of data subjects;   \\nPersonal data, confidential and classified data must be protected against unauthorised access and loss as much as possible. More particularly, personal data should be stored in a GDPR-compliant data storage facility and, where needed, additional security measures such as encryption should be applied;   \\nPersonal data should be anonymised or pseudonymised as soon as possible, preferably immediately after collecting those data. Similarly, secondary datasets containing personal data should be pseudonymised or anonymised immediately after receiving them. Note that unlike anonymised data, pseudonymised data are still personal data;   \\nPrior to sharing research data containing personal data, a data processing agreement should be drawn up in consultation with the Faculty Privacy Contact Person and should be signed by the Faculty Dean. A non-disclosure agreement is required in the case of sharing confidential and classified data; see more details under the “Data Sharing and Transferring” section in this policy;   \\nPersonal data needed for verification and reproduction (at least those underlying all types of academic publications, such as journal articles, reports, theses, etc.) have to be preserved in one of ITC’s approved data repositories or archive facilities for at least ten years after completion of the project (in accordance with The Netherlands Code of Conduct for Academic Practice);   \\nInformed consent forms used to collect personal data, either in digital or non-digital form, have to be archived for at least ten years after completion of the research project; Researchers must report any data breaches immediately. Examples of potential data breach include devices containing personal, confidential and classified data being lost or stolen, sharing these data with the unauthorised persons, etc. For more information on data breach, see Cyber Safety at UT;   \\nResearch involving human subjects or potentially sensitive data about or from individuals, groups or organisations must be reviewed by the ITC Ethics Committee before the work commences. For other types of research, it is strongly recommended to identify potential ethical issues related to, for instance, the environment, dual-use aspects, low-income countries, or artificial intelligence, through an ethics review.  \\n\\nMore information on the appropriate use of personal data in research, including a flowchart and practical guidance, can be found on the UT Cyber Safety Website.  \\n\\nThis  pre-DPIA assessment form should be used to find out whether a full DPIA is required.  \\n\\nUT network storage facilities (e.g., P-drive, Unishare,) are ISO 27001-certified, NEN 7510-certified and GDPR-compliant; therefore, they guarantee maximum security for storing and sharing personal data, confidential and classified data during research.  \\n\\nFor personal data stored in non-UT cloud storage (e.g., MS Teams, OneDrive, etc.) or on portable devices (e.g., USB sticks, external hard drives, tablets, etc.), encryption is required.  \\n\\nPersonal data stored on portable devices must be deleted as soon as possible and no later than at the end of the part of research for which the data are needed (e.g., after fieldwork).  \\n\\nThe encryption key must be kept safe and stored in a separate location. Furthermore, it should be shared with at least one other employee in the research group. Generally, this person will be the principal researcher or the chair of the research group.  \\n\\nNon-digital informed consent forms should be digitised where possible. However, UT has an archive service for non-digital informed consent forms. Please contact the Faculty Data Steward for support.  \\n\\nTo submit your application for ethics review, visit the ITC Ethics Committee website or contact the Faculty’s Research Support Officer.  \\n\\nFor support regarding the handling of personal data in research contact the Faculty’s Privacy Contact Person (PCP).',\n",

       " 'Objective  \\n\\nThe Johannes Kepler University (JKU) acknowledges the fundamental significance of managing research data and related records needed to attain high-quality research and scientific integrity. Correct and easily accessible research data form the basis and essential component of any research activity. They also enable the research process or research results to be reviewed and justified, as well as subsequently used. The JKU strives to promote the highest standards in this respect in compliance with the FAIR principles in order to ensure the long-term value of research data for science, research and society. This policy guideline is designed to advise JKU scientists on how they handle research data.',\n",
       " 'Scope & period of validity  \\n\\nThis guideline covers the collection, processing, storage and subsequent use of research data. It applies to the entire academic staff of the JKU for an indefinite period. If research activities are promoted or financed or sponsored by a third party and the underlying contract requires specific provisions regarding research data (in particular intellectual property rights, access rights, exploitation rights), the provisions of the specific contract shall take precedence over the provisions of this policy guideline. The same applies to cooperation agreements with external research partners.',\n",
       " 'Definition of terms  \\n\\nALCOA+ principle: ALCOA is an acronym that describes the five most important aspects of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) in the handling of clinical research data. These are: Attributable, Legible, Contemporaneous, Original and Accurate. The plus stands for CCEA. This is an extension of the ALCOA principle and stands for Complete, Consistent, Enduring and Available.  \\n\\nData clearing: Data clearing involves checking the permissibility of the transfer of personal data by the JKU to third parties with regard to the latest edition of the data protection act and the basic data Protection ordinance, as well as the protectability of research data, especially in terms of the applicable copyright law. The tasks of data clearing are performed decentrally at the JKU:  \\n\\nThe Legal department is responsible for specific legal matters relating to data protection and copyright, unless these can be fulfilled by one of the following departments.   \\nThe Research service and knowledge transfer department at the JKU is responsible for information and advice on third-party funded projects, research funding and support in the application process.   \\nThe Data protection officer performs their tasks in accordance with article 39 of the GDPR, in particular advising and informing in connection with the processing of personal data and monitoring compliance with the applicable data protection regulations by the JKU and its employees. In addition, pursuant to article 38 (4) of the GDPR, the Data protection officer is a point of contact for data subjects in connection with the processing of their personal data and the exercising of their rights according to the GDPR.   \\nIn addition, JKU researchers are supported by the JKU IPR management department in the field of intellectual property rights (IPR), in particular in connection with patent and licensing matters, and in the drafting of corresponding contracts.   \\nThe Competence Centre for Clinical Studies (KKS Linz) at the Centre for Clinical Research (ZKF) at the medical faculty provides consulting services regarding the processing of personal data in clinical research.  \\n\\nData management plan (DMP): The objective is to describe all activities performed within the context of research activities involving research data throughout their life-cycle by specifying which data are collected, processed and stored for how long and for what purposes, and ensuring that these activities are performed in accordance with the relevant legal (in particular data protection, copyright), contractual and intra-university requirements, in particular the Guideline for safeguarding good scientific practice1, the FAIR principles and ethical principles.2  \\n\\nAustrian privacy law: Federal law regulating the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of their personal data (latest edition of Federal Law Gazette I No. 14/2019).  \\n\\nGDPR: Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council dated 27 April 2016 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, replacing directive 95/46/EC (basic data protection regulation).  \\n\\nThird parties: Natural or legal persons, authorities, institutions or other bodies that are not attributable to the Johannes Kepler University Linz.  \\n\\nFAIR principles: Principles implemented within the framework of research data management to ensure the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability and Re-usability of research data.3  \\n\\nAustrian research organisation law: Federal law concerning general research in accordance with article 89 of the GDPR and research organisation (latest edition of Federal Law Gazette I No. 31/2018).  \\n\\nResearch data: Data resulting from scientific research, experiments, measurements, simulations, surveys or interviews. They include structured mass data as well as unstructured data in a wide range of formats and contents, including process data such as processing steps, algorithms and programs developed during a research project.4 This is all information required to support or validate the history, outcome, observations and findings of research activities (e.g. raw data, processed data, released data, published data).  \\n\\nResearch data management: Process covering the entire life cycle of research data, in particular the planning, acquisition, collection, publication, documentation, provision and storage and archiving of research data.5 Advice and information for researchers in connection with research data management and the preparation of data management plans is provided by staff of the JKU University Library.  \\n\\nResearch documentation (FoDok): Database that stores metadata relating to research performed by JKU employees.  \\n\\nOpen licence: According to article 24 paragraph 1 of Austrian copyright law, the author of a copyrighted work may allow other (natural or legal) persons in the form of a work use licence to use the work for one-off, or all types of exploitation, reserved for the author. Furthermore, the author can also grant others an exclusive (absolute) right to use the work. The transfer of these rights takes place in the form of licenses within the framework of copyright contracts.6 Open licenses (open content) generally allow free or open use, distribution, reproduction and processing of the data as long as the author is named;7 in research, the Creative Commons core licenses (CC BY and CC0) are often used.  \\n\\nAustrian patent law: Patent law 1970, Federal Law Gazette I No. 37/',\n",

In all other respects, the provisions of article 106 in Austrian university law and Austrian copyright law in their respective valid versions shall apply.  \\n\\nIn accordance with section 106(1) sentence 1 of Austrian university law, scientific members of staff at the university shall be entitled to publish their own academic research work and results; this shall also apply to doctors during medical specialist training in accordance with section 96 of Austrian university law as well as to academic staff working on externally funded projects (project staff).9  \\n\\nIn addition, in accordance with section 106(1) sentence 2 in conjunction with sections 11 and 20 of Austrian copyright law, academic members of staff at the university who have made their own academic contribution to a research project shall have the right to be named as co-authors. Scientific members of staff who independently create copy-righted works are therefore entitled to be named as the sole author.10 If a computer program or a database (section 40f paragraph 3 Austrian copyright law) is created by an employee in fulfilment of tasks for which they are employed, the right to copyright designation according to section 40b Austrian copyright law - unless agreed otherwise - belongs to the employer.11  \\n\\nIn the case of an employee invention in accordance with section 7 paragraph 3 of Austrian patent law, the rectorate must be informed of the invention and the JKU has a right of access to it in accordance with section 106 paragraph 3 Austrian university law. In accordance with section 8 paragraph 1 Austrian patent law, the researcher is entitled to special remuneration for transferring their invention to the employer and for granting right of use with regard to such an invention (cf. SOP 8209). According to Section 20 paragraph 1 Austrian patent law, the inventor is entitled to be named as the inventor.  \\n\\n#### 4.2  Special provisions relating to the Faculty of Medicine  \\n\\nIn the case of employee inventions made by employees of the JKU or Kepler Universitätsklinikum GmbH (KUK) and the JKU, the cooperation agreement between the JKU and KUK stipulates in sections 23.',\n",

       " 'In order to maintain the integrity of research data, it must be stored correctly, completely, unaltered and reliably, and must be findable, accessible, traceable, interoperable and, where possible, made available for re-use in accordance with FAIR principles. To enable the re-use of research data or research results by citing the original sources, the currently valid citation rules must be applied.  The storage must be dated, and subsequent changes must be stored as separately as possible from the original data. When dealing with clinical research data, it is recommended that the ALCOA+ principle of good clinical practice be applied.  \\n\\nWhenever personal data is handled, it must be in compliance with the applicable data protection regulations. When handling health data, the increased data protection requirements must be met. According to article 2 paragraph 1 of the GDPR in conjunction with article 4 paragraph 1 of Austrian privacy law, the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation and the Austrian privacy law apply to the fully and partially automated processing of personal data. If data are not processed automatically, but manually instead, the GDPR only applies if the data are stored or are to be stored in a structured file system that is organised according to specific criteria, so that access to the personal data it contains is not only possible by sequentially going through the entire collection, but there is a simplified method of indexing and locating its contents.13 Files and collections of files and their cover sheets which are not arranged according to specific criteria - and are therefore unstructured - are not covered by the GDPR; paper files, for example, such as court files in particular, are not covered.14 Also excluded are data obtained purely orally, acoustically or visually, provided they are not to be stored.15  \\n\\nIn the absence of any particular creative achievement (since the implementation and display of results is usually the task of a computer program) - individual data, raw data or results of the mere evaluation or analysis results are in principle not works in accordance with section 1 paragraph 1 of Austrian copyright law and are therefore not protected by copyright, so there is also no provision for licensing.16  \\n\\nHowever, data collections may constitute databases protected by copyright in accordance with section 40f paragraph 1 of Austrian copyright law (database works). But, if the collection of data does not achieve the necessary level of creativity (simple database), it is not protected as a collective work (section 6 Austrian copyright law); in this case ancillary copyright in accordance with section 76c onwards of Austrian copyright law applies if a substantial investment was required for the procurement, verification and presentation of the contents of the database.17 Whether or what kind of protectability applies to research data requires verification in each individual case by the department responsible for data clearing.  \\n\\nProvided that there are no third-party rights, legal obligations, ethical aspects or property regulations to the contrary, research data should be freely licensed and made openly available for re-use, while respecting intellectual property rights.  \\n\\nIn accordance with section 2f paragraph 3 of Austrian research organisation law, the minimum archiving period for research data is 10 years from publication of the research results or completion of the research activity. The administrative documents accompanying the research activities must also be archived. If research data and records are to be (or have to be) erased or destroyed, this may only be performed using a standardised process, taking into account all legal regulations, especially internal university regulations and ethical aspects. Principal investigators or their legal successors must be informed and offered the opportunity for the research data to be handed over.

Introduction  \\n\\nKarlstad University is responsible for ensuring that all research data are reliable and managed in a legal, appropriate and secure manner in conformity with standard research practice. The university advocates the implementation of a clear structure in how data, material and documents are organised through the research process, in order to avoid time-consuming work in connection with archiving, sharing and reusing the vast amount of data generated by research.  \\n\\nKarlstad University takes active measures to ensure that research data and related meta data are findable, accessible and re-usable for further research purposes in accordance with the recommendations of the EU commission1 and the Swedish government.23',\n",
       " '2. Definitions  \\n\\nAccording to the ethics review act,4 research refers to ”scientific experimental or theoretical work designed to obtain new knowledge and research-based development projects, excluding projects carried out as part of undergraduate or master level studies”.  \\n\\nThe term principal research institution  refers, according to the ethics review act, to ”a public authority or physical or legal body in whose organisation the research is carried out.”  \\n\\nAccording to the National Archives’ general directives on deletion of research-related documents in public authorities,5 a research project is defined as ”a research activity delimited in time and purpose related to a certain assignment and/or certain persons.” A research project can comprise several sub projects and can be externally or internally funded.  \\n\\nIn terms of these guidelines, research data can refer to all forms of stored data collected or created to be analysed for research purposes and on which results and conclusions generated through the research are based. Some examples of research data are statistics and measuring data, transcribed interviews and questionnaire answers, results of experiments, field study observations, audio-video recorded interviews and visual images/art.  \\n\\nThe term meta data refers in these guidelines to a structured description of research data, i.e. “data about data”. Meta data can consist of a descriptive or contextual information on the provenance of data, such as how variables are defined, how data are structured, how various data sets are related, information on  how and by whom the data were collected or if a special software was used to read or analyse the data.  \\n\\nThe term data citation refers, in these guidelines, to the practice of referring to research data in the same way that researchers provide references to journal articles, reports, conference contribution and other publications.',\n",
       " '3. Foundational principles for research data management  \\n\\nKarlstad University is the principal research institution for the research carried out by staff or affiliated staff at the university. Research data collected by researchers or doctoral students belong as a rule to Karlstad University. This means that the university has ownership6 to research data, and also responsibility for managing research data in a legal, appropriate and secure manner.  \\n\\nAn important principle regarding research data is that it shall be preserved and accessible so that primary material and data analysed can be used without problem to support and verify the methods and results of the research.  \\n\\nAll research projects at Karlstad University shall undergo ethical review and be registered in the university registry, according to the review process decided by the vice-chancellor.',\n",
       " '3.1 Public documents  \\n\\nKarlstad University is a public authority under the government. This means that research data management must comply with the basic principles applying to all public authorities’ handling of public documents.  \\n\\nResearch data collected outside of Karlstad University become public documents when submitted to the university. Research data created at the university as a rule are to be seen as drawn up public documents when the data are finalised in the research process.7  \\n\\nResearch data shall be stored in an easily accessible way as long as they are deemed valuable for  further research and also be prepared for long-term storage and archiving in accordance with the regulations of the National Archives and the university’s guidelines.  Research data can only be disposed of if there is a rule allowing it. Disposal must follow the local rules on procedures at Karlstad University.',\n",
       " '3.2 The principle of public access to information  \\n\\nThe principle of public access means that the public and the media have the right to insight into governmental authorities’ operations.  In principle, this means that Swedish as well as foreign citizens have the right to request reading the documents held by Swedish authorities. Generally speaking, this also applies to research data collected or created at Karlstad University.  \\n\\nThe right to request documents is, however, restricted in two ways. First, not all documents held by an authority are public documents; second,  certain information in public documents can be confidential (secrecy marked).  Before research data are provided under the public access principle, a secrecy assessment must be made in each individual case.',\n",
       " '3.3 Data protection management and ethical review  \\n\\nThe General Data Protection Regulation8 (GDPR), in brief, means that personal data may only be collected for certain justified reasons, that no more data than necessary may be treated, that data may not be stored for longer than necessary, and that treatment should be justified and reasonable in relation to the individual’s basic rights and freedoms. It is also important to ensure that personal data are handled in a secure way and that no more people than those authorised have access to the data.  \\n\\nIf  sensitive personal data (article 9 GDPR) or information of criminal offences (article 10 GDPR) are treated for research purposes, also the rules stipulated in legislation pertaining to ethical review of research on humans must be considered. When these types of personal data are treated, the approval of the Ethical Review Authority is always required. Applicants are first  to be submitted to the local ethics board at Karlstad University.',\n",
       " '3.4 Information security  \\n\\nInformation security involves protecting information against various forms of threat by adapting the technical, physical and administrative environments in which the information is handled. With regard to the delicacy of information and the risks involved in the handling, Karlstad University has a general responsibility for implementing appropriate technical and organisational protective measures to ensure and be able to demonstrate that the information is handled appropriately and in compliance with current legislation.  \\n\\nResearch data must therefore be handled to ensure that information is protected against unauthorised access (confidentiality), erroneous changes (accuracy), and that the information is accessible when needed  (accessibility). It is also important to make sure that the information cannot be changed, requested by or provided to any unauthorised persons (traceability).  \\n\\nThe two most important measures for achieving appropriate information security for research data is either to classification of information to be treated (i.e. completely insignificant information, sensitive information,  personal data, sensitive personal data or confidential information), or to use the IT resources available for the purpose at Karlstad University. As a rule, research data shall only be handled in the IT systems and cloud services provided by Karlstad University with the appropriate and adapted technical and organisational protection measures.',\n",
       " '3.5 Research projects with several principal research institutions  \\n\\nKarlstad University is principal research institution and responsible for research data generated by various researchers and research groups at the university.   However, the situation is more complex when it comes to collaboration projects with four principal research institutions. For such projects, agreements regulating the collaboration should as a rule be drawn up, including how research data will be handled in the project.  How to handle research data can also be documented by drawing up a data management plan for the project.  \\n\\nResearch data collected and created at Karlstad University normally belong to the university. If  there are plans to move a research project, or parts of it,  to or from Karlstad University, the  possibilities to transfer, copy or borrow research data should be investigated.9 If research data will be transferred from Karlstad University the National archives must be notified. A researcher who moves from Karlstad University needs to investigate the conditions for transferring data in consultation with Karlstad University and the receiving university before the transfer.',\n",
       " '3.6 Data management plans  \\n\\nThe process of handling research data continues through the whole life cycle of a research project. The process includes collecting, documenting, processing, storing, sharing, archiving and deleting documents.  Proceeding in a structured way and making data accessible will ensure a future reuse of  the material.  \\n\\nSome funders require a data management plan for the research projects receiving funding. The plan shall describe how the data used in the course of research are collected and/or created will be handled after the project completion. Karlstad University recommends that a plan be drawn up for all projects generating research data, also if not required by the funder.',\n",
       " '4. Open access to research data  \\n\\nOpen access to research data means that electronic research data and related meta data shall be easily accessible via the internet with as few restrictions as possible. In July 2012, the EU commission recommended the member state to contribute to increased access to research information.  As part of Horizon 2020, further recommendations were issued for open science comprising publications as well as research data. The recommendations were updated in the spring of 2018 and describe how member states should promote sharing research data via national action plans and joint storage solutions, as well as inventive programmes, reward systems and, instruction for researchers.10  \\n\\nIn its research strategic proposition,  \"Knowledge in collaboration: for societal challenges and reinforced competitiveness\" the Swedish government states that  ”research results, such as research data and research publications generated through publicly funded research should be open and accessible as far as possible.  Certain types of data, however, require restricted access to protect personal integrity, national security, for example.  Openness for research with an innovation potential may need to be restricted for reasons of intellectual property rights.  However, it is an important position that open access is the norm and that restrictions in this regard are exceptions\".11  \\n\\nKarlstad University actively works towards promoting open access to research data according to the EU commission\\'s and the government\\'s recommendations.  Research data which are the result of partly or wholly public funding should without charge make data accessible to further research on condition that there is no legal (e.g. secrecy or rules on personal data handling), ethical, technical or commercial reasons. Access to research data shall, at Karlstad University, follow the principle \"as open as possible and as restricted as necessary.\"  \\n\\nCertain types of data, however, may not be made accessible, not even with restrictions. For obvious reasons, it is not, for example, permitted to publish confidential information openly on the internet, which means revealing secrets, which is a crime.  This prohibition also applies to research data containing personal data. There are many occasions on which research data may not be made open and accessible, and an assessment must be made in every individual  \\n\\nResearchers at Karlstad University are responsible for making research data accessible in an appropriate way. There is no requirement that the data should be made accessible before the researchers have published their results. Karlstad University recommends that researchers as a rule make data accessible in an established data repositorium –– completely open or with restrictions based on assessment of appropriateness ––  with data citation requirements.',\n",
       " \"5. FAIR principles  \\n\\nThe FAIR principles12  (F - Findable, A - Accessible, I - Interoperable, R - Reusable) play an important part in efforts towards open science.  They describe some of the most central guidelines for sound data management and open access to electronic research data.  Research data do not need be in digital form originally, but efficient accessibility and FAIR implementation require data in digital form.  The FAIR principles were published for the first time in 2016 and since then the EU and a number of research funders, universities and research infrastructures have endorsed them. In Sweden,  the Research Council and the Royal Library have the government's mandate to develop criteria for assessing the extent to which research data and scholarly publications meet the FAIR principles.13 Altogether, FAIR comprises 15 principles which can be applied to research in all disciplines.  \\n\\nHandling digital research data at Karlstad University should follow the international FAIR principles to the extent it is practicable.  Karlstad University strives to make research data with related meta data findable, accessible and reusable for new research purposes long-term, which generally means several generations of the hard and software required for the processing.  \\n\\nHowever, it is important to note that the FAIR principles do not entail that digital research data should always be open and accessible to everyone. Research ethical assessments, information provided to research participants, personal data protection legislation, and secrecy are factors that always warrant attention before research data can be made accessible beyond the research group, as described under section 5 above.\",\n",
       " '6. Responsibility for research data management  \\n\\nKarlstad University is principal research institution for the research carried out at the university. This means that the university is responsible for ensuring that all research data are reliable and managed in a legal, appropriate and secure manner in conformity with standard research practice.  \\n\\nAs head of the authority, the vice-chancellor has the main responsibility to ensure that operations are carried out according to legislation and efficiently. The vice-chancellor decides on all overarching regulatory documents at Karlstad University.  \\n\\nAt faculty level, the dean is responsible for faculty adherence to current legislation and approved regulatory documents regarding research data management. The dean may delegate the responsibility to department heads.  Heads of departments are responsible for ensuring that departmental research data are archived and disposed of in compliance with the law.  \\n\\nHowever, researchers always have the main responsibility for their research and must comply with standard research practice, current legislation and procedures.  This also applies to sound and appropriate handling of research data.  \\n\\nResearch projects with several researchers from Karlstad University the main responsible researchers should normally be responsible for the research data management. If the main responsible researchers should leave Karlstad University or for some other reason should be unable to perform the task, the responsibility is transferred to the head of department hosting the research project. until a new project leader has been appointed. If research data are transferred to another part of Karlstad University, so is the responsibility for the data.',\n",
       " \"7. Research data management support  \\n\\nAt Karlstad University there is a research data group for issues relating to research data management, data management plans and open access to research data.  \\n\\nThe research data group's duty is to inform about research data issues at the university and to ensure that concerned target groups are updated and have the opportunity to get instruction regularly.  The research data group also has a supportive and consultative function in terms of advice and recommendations on research data management, data management plans and open access to research data.  \\n\\nThe research data group consists of representatives from the central service functions. There is also a reference group with researchers from the faculties. The research data group can be reached at the following address: forskningsdata@kau.se\",\n",

       " 'III. Definitions  \\n\\nResearch data:  \\n\\nWhile there is no single definition of data, research data can generally be defined as any representation or other objects that are created or gathered for the purposes of producing research or scholarship, and which can be used to validate or reproduce original research findings. The underlying research materials which support research publications can be described as research data. Research data can cover a diversity of form and content, including (but not limited to) numbers, text, images, audio, simulations, models, interview recordings, questionnaires, laboratory notebooks, videos, algorithms, codebooks, test results, specimens, databases or any combination of these.

These principles are compatible with the motto “As open as possible, as closed as necessary”.',\n",
       " '1.1 Creating a data management plan  \\n\\nResearchers must create a data management plan at an early stage in the research process in order to facilitate the management of research data.  Such a plan must state who is responsible for data management and for ensuring that management takes place with due consideration to ethical aspects and in accordance with current legislation. The technical solutions and work methods selected must satisfy the requirements of applicable regulations. It must in particular be clarified whether any stage of the research process involves the management of datasets that  \\n\\nare a public document in accordance with the Swedish Freedom of the Press Act   \\n(1949:105) and how this information is to be made available;   \\nare a general document subject to confidentiality in accordance with the Swedish Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act (2009:400) and that management takes place to ensure that confidentiality is not prejudiced;   \\nare security-protected and that in such cases management takes place in accordance with security protection legislation;   \\nare collected in such a way that an ethical review needs to take place in accordance with the current Swedish Ethical Review Act (2003:460);   \\ncontain personal data and that in such cases processing takes place in accordance with data protection legislation and that processing is recorded in KTH’s personal data processing register;  \\n\\nhave a future research value and should be preserved in the long term in accordance with the Swedish National Archives’ regulations (RA-FS 1999:1).  \\n\\nThe regulatory framework for research data management with regard to preservation is described in KTH’s information management plan.

       " '1.2 Research data management in collaborations  \\n\\nWhen research takes place in collaboration with other actors, data management must be clarified in, or in connection with, the research collaboration agreement that should be concluded between the parties. This must specify who is responsible, whether there are any reasons for confidentiality and, in cases where intellectual property values arise, who has the access rights and ownership rights. If there is processing of personal data, responsibility for this must be clearly specified.  \\n\\nKTH strives to ensure that exclusive ownership rights to publish and reuse research data are not assigned to other actors, and that KTH retains access rights to use research data in future research and education.',\n",
       " '1.3 Publication of research data  \\n\\nAs a basic principle, research data that forms the basis of published research results should be made publicly available and be findable in such a way that data can be reused. When publishing research data or metadata about research data, KTH Royal Institute of Technology should be given as affiliation in the same way as for any other publication (see also Guidelines on Scientific Publications). It is also appropriate for the dataset to be assigned a persistent identifier and for there to be an opportunity for versioning when data is made available in connection with publication.  \\n\\nMetadata must state clearly what conditions apply for access and reproduction of the dataset. If there are legal, ethical or commercial obstacles to complete digital availability, it is recommended that metadata be published describing the dataset including the conditions for access. If the publication of metadata is also considered inappropriate with regard to the protection of critical infrastructure or with regard to Sweden’s national security or information security in general, publication must be avoided.',\n",

The person who is responsible for research data management should be sufficiently knowledgeable in the field of research to be able to make sure that the documentation of research data that is managed in the research process takes place in accordance with good research practice. If no responsible person has been appointed in the data management plan, the researcher responsible for the project is also the responsible for research data management. If the responsible person ceases to be employed at KTH, the head of school or the person delegated by the head of school assumes responsibility until a new person responsible for research data management is appointed.  \\n\\nThe person who is appointed is responsible for managing research data in accordance with good research practice, current legislation, commitments to research funding bodies and KTH’s policy document; drawing up necessary and adequate documentation of research data; ensuring that research data is made available in connection with publication with sufficient documentation to be findable and reusable.',\n",

       " 'Background  \\n\\n1. Management of data is an essential part of good research practice and all researchers in the University have an obligation to record, store and archive their data appropriately.  This brings with it the assurance that data supporting publications are available for analysis and will enable access by other researchers who could use the data, thus maximising the effectiveness of our research funding. The precise requirements of this and the procedures that should be used is a very complex issue when considering the wide range of information generated in research.  Thus the primary responsibility for research data management lies with individual researchers, and it is these staff who need to consider each individual project, whether it is appropriate to archive data and exactly what data should be stored.  However, this policy sets out our expectations, support and processes that are aimed at ensuring that research data from Lancaster is managed in the best possible way.  \\n\\nIT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THIS IS A RAPIDLY EVOLVING ENDEAVOUR SO THAT THE UNIVERSITY WILL BE CONTINUALLY AIMING TO DEVELOP THESE GUIDELINES.',\n",
       " 'What should researchers do?  \\n\\n2. Researchers at Lancaster University will identify which projects are appropriate and which data are to be archived.  In this context they will then manage their data in such a way that they:  \\n\\nensure research data and records are accurate, complete, authentic and reliable;   \\nmeet funding body grant requirements;   \\nensure that confidentiality and anonymisation requirements are achieved;   \\ncomply with the Data Protection Act and Freedom of Information legislation;   \\nmaximise research efficiency by enabling others to use the data;   \\nminimise the risk of data loss (e.g. by data backup).  \\n\\n3. More specifically, Lancaster University expects that:  \\n\\n(I) all research will be carried out according to the principles laid out in the University Research Ethics Code of Practice;   \\n(II) primary responsibility for research data management during any research project or programme lies with the principal investigator;   \\n(III) the principal investigator will be responsible for clarifying responsibilities where data ownership may be ambiguous (e.g. in a multi-partner collaboration).  If a PI leaves Lancaster their Head of Department should ensure that appropriate provision has been made for data access;   \\n(IV) every member of a research team should be familiar with the data requirements of the organisation funding their research and of this University policy;   \\n(V) each project will have a data management plan that is produced at funding application stage or at the beginning of the project.  Note that some funders will have more rigorous conditions than those described here;   \\n(VI) as a minimum, research data directly associated with publications should be archived;   \\n(VII) all research data to be archived must be associated with metadata which meets minimum standards set out in guidelines given on RSO website.  The metadata should be sufficient to enable other researchers to understand how it was created or acquired, and, if it is to be made openly available, to discover it and assess its reuse potential;   \\n(VIII) all research data will be stored in either electronic or paper form for a minimum of 10 years after the end of a project, unless ethical considerations, participant confidentiality, FOI requirements or external agencies e.g. NHS, specifically require otherwise;   \\n(IX) research data will be submitted to national or international data services and repositories where available or required by either funders or publishers and this will replace the need for local archiving;   \\n(X) exclusive rights to reuse or publish research data should not be handed over to commercial publishers or agents without retaining the rights to make the data openly available for re-use, unless this is a condition of the funding.',\n",
       " 'What will the University do?  \\n\\n4. In order to support researchers and satisfy the requirements of the funders the University will:  \\n\\n4.1 store research processes/governance information and research management documentation in accordance with the Record Retention and Disposal Schedule Guidance.  The Research Support Office will store the following information in accordance with the Schedule and funders’ requirements: funders’ award letters, contracts and collaboration agreements, financial statements, claims and their relevant evidential documentation, audit certificates and ethical approval documentation;  \\n\\n4.2 aim to provide mechanisms whereby research data that may be useful for other researchers but is not suitable for national repositories, can be archived appropriately.

       " 'Definitions  \\n\\nResearch:  The HEFCE definition of research in relation to the REF is:  ‘Research’ is understood as original investigation undertaken in order to gain knowledge and understanding.  It includes work of direct relevance to the needs of commerce, industry, and to the public and voluntary sectors; scholarship [\\\\*]; the invention and generation of ideas, images, performances, artefacts including design, where these lead to new or substantially improved insights; and the use of existing knowledge in experimental development to produce new or substantially improved materials, devices, products and processes, including design and construction.  It excludes routine testing and routine analysis of materials, components and processes such as for the maintenance of national standards, as distinct from the development of new analytical techniques.  It also excludes the development of teaching materials that do not embody original research.  \\n\\nResearch Data:   This is not easy to define in a comprehensive way it is therefore important for each researcher to consider this in detail in the context of their own project.  To give a broad view the University of Melbourne uses the following definition:  “Research Data are facts, observations or experiences on which an argument, theory or test is based.  Data may be numerical, descriptive or visual.  Data may be raw or analysed, experimental or observational.

       " \"# Guidelines for Handling Research Data at Leibniz University Hannover  \\n\\n## PREAMBLE  \\n\\nLeibniz University Hannover recognises the importance of research data in the process of scientific research.  \\n\\nThese guidelines and the principles outlined in them are based in particular on the Alliance of German Science Organisations’ “Principles for the Handling of Research Data”1 and on the German Research Foundation’s (DFG) “Guidelines on the Handling of Research Data”.2  \\n\\nThe reliable and responsible handling of research data is indispensable for the traceability of research and the dissemination of scientific findings. The production, processing, documentation, safeguarding, preservation and sustainable provision of research data should therefore take place in accordance with the recognised standards for each discipline and be based on the FAIR data principles.3 This guarantees that data and metadata are findable, accessible, interoperable and re-usable. At the same time, legal and ethical requirements, as well as the characteristics of and differences between scientific disciplines, should be observed.  \\n\\nLUH encourages the development of proper recognition for its researchers, who provide access to their high-quality research data in recognised repositories and archives in accordance with the FAIR principles.  \\n\\n## DEFINITION OF RESEARCH DATA AT LEIBNIZ UNIVERSITY HANNOVER  \\n\\nResearch data refers to all data that is collected and processed during the scientific research process. It forms the basis for scientific research findings. Depending on the scientific discipline, this can include very different types of data. Leibniz University Hannover adopts the DFG's definition of research data, which includes, among others, the following types of data: “measurement data, laboratory results, audiovisual information, texts, survey data, objects from collections, or samples […]. Methodical forms of testing such as questionnaires, software and simulations may also […] be categorised as research data.”4  \\n\\nResearch-data management ensures the accessibility, re-use, reproducibility and quality of research findings. It includes both the planning and the implementation of a process for the handling of research data. The cross-linking of research data with metadata throughout the research process ensures that data can be easily located and reused. An overview of subject-specific and cross-disciplinary metadata schemas is available in the RDA Metadata Directory.5  \\n\\n### PRINCIPLES\",\n",
       " 'Research project heads and independent researchers are obligated to observe the principles of good scientific practice in order to prevent data loss, prepare research data for sustainable use, and document and archive this data.6 They are responsible for data management for their research activities and projects and for the integrity of the data collected.',\n",
       " \"Leibniz University Hannover requests that its researchers store, archive and publish research data in subject-specific repositories or in the university's existing institutional infrastructure – provided that this complies with legal and ethical requirements. This ensures that research data is freely accessible to the public, in accordance with the Leibniz University Hannover Open Access Policy.7, 8 At a minimum, research data should be freely available for scientific use, and to ensure reusability it should be assigned an open licence.9 The citation should likewise be assigned a persistent identifier, e.g. DOI (digital object identifier). Leibniz University Hannover recommends that its researchers use CC0 or CC BY licences to enable the extensive reuse of their work. This is in accordance with the requirements of the funding bodies as well as the FAIR data principles.\",\n",
       " 'Leibniz University Hannover advises its researchers to develop internal institute and/or project guidelines which establish detailed rules for handling research data. Researchers should also systematically draft and implement data management plans within the scope of project planning.',\n",
       " \"Leibniz University Hannover recommends that its faculties and research schools integrate the subject-specific handling of research data into their teaching.  \\n\\n### SUPPORTING THE IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS  \\n\\nLeibniz University Hannover supports its researchers throughout the entire research-data management process, from project planning to publication, with an advising and training programme. It also provides an institutional data repository.10 The advisory and training offers also cover issues related to ethical and legal requirements. This service combines the expertise of the TIB – Leibniz Information Centre for Science and Technology, the Leibniz University IT Services, and the Research and Innovation Services department. Up-to-date information about research-data management at Leibniz University Hannover is available on the university's research-data management website: www.fdm.uni-hannover.de/en  \\n\\nThis version of the guidelines was approved by the Presidential Board and the Senate on 15 July\",\n",

       " '# Research Data Management Regulations Leiden University  \\n\\nFocal points and explanations of the various articles appear in italic.  \\n\\n## A. Definitions and basis',\n",
       " 'These regulations are intended as a framework for a University research data management policy and require further elaboration at disciplinary level. Each Faculty Board must decide how the regulations will be further elaborated upon within the faculty and which role the institutes will play.',\n",
       " 'Research data is understood to mean the following: all data that is gathered and generated during academic research. This also includes the data that is acquired by processing and analysing (raw) research data. We follow NWO here, which states, ‘we understand “data” to mean both gathered, unprocessed data and analysed, generated data.’ This does not mean that all data must also be preserved. The decision concerning which data to preserve is recorded at the disciplinary level (see article 16).',\n",
       " 'These regulations apply to all digital and non-digital research data.  \\n\\nWe follow NWO policy here. Non-digital data can mean, for instance, preserved bio-material, audio recordings, paper questionnaires and paper lab journals. NB: this stipulation does not mean that all non-digital data must be digitised per se, but it does mean that the same requirements apply to non-digital data concerning findability, reusability, long-term preservation, etc.  \\n\\n### Before the research',\n",
       " 'A data management plan (DMP) must be drawn up before data collection for a research project begins. The DMP elaborates upon the data management policy of the faculty/institute for the specific research project in question.  \\n\\n### During the research',\n",
       " 'During the research, research data must be securely preserved. This means that the integrity, availability and – if required – confidentiality of the data must be guaranteed. Please note: once the research has been completed, the research data must be preserved for the long term together with the metadata, software and other documentation required for reuse (Article 7). This must also be borne in mind during the research, for instance because it will generally be impossible to provide satisfactory metadata for all the data once the research has been completed.  \\n\\n### After the research',\n",
       " 'Research data must be managed in such a way that, at the latest, - at the point in time of the last publication arising from the research, or at the point in time of the formal completion of the research project it is preserved so that it is at least findable, accessible, comprehensible and reusable in the long term.  \\n\\nTwo instances are mentioned here because not all research culminates in a publication. However, it   \\nis then also important that the research data is preserved and is findable. Externally funded   \\nresearch projects will generally formally conclude upon their financial-administrative completion. n explanation of the criteria that are used: Findable The data must be findable for other researchers and involved parties. Its findability improves if it is deposited in a (discipline-specific) data archive or repository. The information about the data (metadata) is then registered in a standardised manner and is findable, also for search engines. Future findability is guaranteed by assigning a persistent identifier to the data. A commonly used identifier for data is DOI (digital object identifier). A DOI is assigned by a data archive or data publisher and is a unique number for a digital object, in this case a dataset. The DOI remains the same even if the location of the dataset (URL) changes. A DOI or other persistent identifier is used in citations or references to the dataset. Accessible: Data accessibility does not necessarily mean that the data must immediately be made fully open. The data will have to be made accessible in some instances, for example for verification by a grant provider or journal, but will remain inaccessible to the wider public. With sensitive data, full publication will never be an option. Research data can be retained under embargo; then only those who have deposited the data have access to it. The duration of the embargo is determined in consultation with the data archive. A further option is only to grant access if a request for access is submitted to the researcher. The researcher then knows who is consulting the data and can reach agreements about its use and reuse. NB: if the decision is made to limit access to the data, it is essential that the metadata (description of the data) is findable. Comprehensible Metadata and any supplementary documentation must describe the data in such a way that other researchers will also be able to understand and use it. Reusable This criterion is further elaborated upon in Article',\n",
       " 'Long-term retention This criterion is further elaborated upon in Article',\n",
       " 'Research data must be stored together with the metadata, other documentation and   \\npossibly the software and version of the software required for its potential reuse.  \\n\\nResearch data must be stored in such a way that it is independent of the underlying equipment/hardware, such as microscopes, scanners or recording equipment. Long-term data formats that are supported by data archives should be used if possible. Retention of hardware can be considered in certain cases, for instance in the case of software that is only compatible with an obsolete computer operating system. Close attention must be paid to the cost/benefit ratio here.',\n",
       " 'Once the research has been completed, the research data must be retained securely for the long term. This means that the integrity, availability and – if required – confidentiality of the data must be guaranteed. The data should be retained according to international guidelines. For digital data this can be achieved by preserving it in a Trusted Digital Repository (an online depot). Non-digital research data must be preserved according to the prevailing standards in the discipline.  \\n\\nA Trusted Digital Repository possesses equipment, hardware and software for the long term and reliable retention of digital information. This facility must be embedded in a reliable organisation that has a long-term mission and funding. There are three prevailing international standards for Trusted Digital Repositories and the manner in which they retain digital data for the long term. In ascending order of reliability requirements these are: the Data Seal of Approval1, the Nestor Seal2 (also known as DIN 31644) and the RAC standards3 (also known as ISO 16363). Data preservation at a repository with a Data Seal of Approval (the lowest category) currently suffices for NWO and Horizon',\n",
       " 'It is recommended to digitise non-digital data as far as possible for long-term retention.',\n",
       " 'The minimum retention term for research data is ten years.  \\n\\nHere we follow The Netherlands Code of Conduct for Scientific Practice of the VSNU (2014 version).  \\n\\n## B. Responsibilities',\n",
       " 'The Faculty Board is responsible for the further elaboration of these regulations and determines the level at which this takes place: at faculty and/or institute level. These regulations are a framework within which the faculty can determine its own policy. This will be sometimes only at faculty and sometimes only at institute level; sometimes a combination of both will be the most appropriate. With regard to the latter, this could mean general faculty regulations that have a specific appendix for each institute.',\n",
       " 'The academic director of the institute is responsible for the correct implementation of the policy. The DMPs for the research projects in the institute describe how the policy is implemented in practice (see below).',\n",
       " 'The DMP for a research project must record which data-management responsibilities are assigned to the various members of staff who are working on the project.  \\n\\nMany research projects involve several researchers, for instance PhD candidates, postdocs and members of the permanent staff. The DMP records which responsibilities have been assigned to whom. Projects in which researchers from multiple institutes and/or external parties are involved require special attention. It is also important to record what will happen to the data and the responsibility for it if one of the researchers leaves.',\n",
       " 'All DMPs must be stored centrally within the faculty or institute for at least 20 years.  \\n\\nPlease note: if a DMP is destroyed, the researcher or institute can no longer demonstrate how certain decisions concerning the destruction of data were made (with regard to academic integrity). The retention term is longer for a DMP than for the data, because the DMP can then be used in any instances that arise to demonstrate that the destruction of a certain dataset (for instance after the standard ten years) was in line with the DMP.',\n",
       " 'A data protection officer is appointed at university level who is responsible for adherence to the policy with regard to the security of research data.  \\n\\nIf research proposals are being granted funding within the Horizon 2020 framework, the data protection officer may be asked to provide a statement to the effect that the ‘technical data protection procedures’ will be adhered to within the project. The data protection officer is thus responsible for the protection of the research data during the project.',\n",
       " 'The Executive Board is responsible for providing the facilities and support that make reliable data management possible.  \\n\\nThis does not mean that all facilities and support must necessarily be offered within the University; if required and beneficial, agreements can be reached with national or international parties who offer facilities and/or support in the field of data management.  \\n\\n## C. Elaboration',\n",
       " 'In the elaboration of these University regulations, the following aspects at least must be addressed. Derogations from these regulations must be recorded and well-motivated. The elaboration of the regulations should correspond with the standards that currently prevail in the discipline. How data-management responsibilities are assigned within the institute; Which data needs to be retained, given the type of research conducted in the institute; What the policy is concerning data arising from bachelor’s, master’s and research master’s programmes (and theses in particular); How the requirement that the integrity, availability and confidentiality of the data must be guaranteed will be met during the research; How, once the research has been completed, the requirement will be met that at the time of the research’s publication the data must be retained in such a way that it remains findable, accessible, comprehensible and reusable in the long term. A possible maximum retention term for data and DMPs.',\n",
       " 'The following aspects at least must be covered in the DMP for a research project:  \\n\\nHow data-management responsibilities are assigned within the project and what will happen if the researcher, or one of the researchers, leaves;   \\nThe types of data that will be generated and collected (with format and scope);   \\nThe collection method(s) or origin of the data (including hardware and software);   \\nThe standards and metadata for the documentation of the data (discipline-focused and/or in line with standards set by the repository where the data is preserved);   \\nWhere the data will be preserved during the research and how security and access will be arranged;   \\nThe measures that will be taken for the long-time preservation of and access to the data; Who will have access to the data at which point;   \\nHow sensitive or otherwise confidential data is dealt with.   \\nResearchers can use the templates that grant providers such as NWO and the European   \\nCommission use to draw up a DMP. The University has also created such a template. In the DMP,  \\n\\nresearchers can in part refer to or draw upon the data management policy of their faculty or institute.',\n",
       " 'All the above articles have an implementation term of three years from the time of establishment, with the exception of the appointment of the data protection officer. The proposed policy has such an impact that it is not realistic to make it compulsory within the short term. Opting for an extended implementation period means that faculties and institutes each have the opportunity to apply their own phasing-in plan. This does not alter the fact that in particular researchers who wish to submit grant proposals will probably already need to follow the greater part of this policy in the short term.',\n",
       " 'These regulations do not have retroactive effect.  \\n\\nIn principle, data collected in research projects that have already been completed therefore does not fall under the regulations. There is a grey area here if a new project builds upon previously collected data; it will be necessary to examine on a case-by-case basis whether it is possible to preserve the old data for the long term.',\n",
       " 'If there is due cause, these regulations will be revised by the Executive Board during the implementation phase above. At least the Research Council, the ICT and Research Steering Group and the Information Managers Platform must be consulted for such a revision.  \\n\\nThe Research Data Management Regulations were established by the Executive Board on 19 April 2016.',\n",

It outlines how the researcher will address requirements that apply to the research and steps that will be taken to ensure it can be verified and reused.  \\n\\nLSHTM-led research projects working with research data must prepare a Data Management Plan (DMP) before the commencement of research, even if not required by their research funder.  \\n\\nA Data Management Plan should be written at the appropriate stage:  \\n\\nPublic/private funded research should prepare a Data Management Plan prior to submission of a research application or within the first 3 months of project funding, as required by the funder.   \\nPhD/DrPH students should agree a Data Management Plan with their Supervisor and submit it as part of their Upgrading or Review Report.   \\nResearchers that are unfunded, working with 3rd party data only, performing consultancy, undertaking an MSc project solely in pursuit of a qualification are encouraged to prepare Data Management Plan, but are not covered by this mandate.  \\n\\nIt is advisable to develop a Data Management Plan in conjunction with other relevant documents, such as the research plan/protocol and Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA), where appropriate.  \\n\\nAll researchers associated with a research project must be made aware of and abide by the Data Management Plan.  \\n\\nThe Data Management Plan should be reviewed and updated at appropriate stages during the research lifecycle.

As documents resulting from research at the Faculties of Humanities and Theology are increasingly digital, it is of the utmost importance to establish procedures to ensure that the data will remain available in a way that corresponds to the current paper documents.  \\n\\nThe long-term goal of introducing these new procedures is to promote:  \\n\\nopen research   \\ngood research practice and good data management in the research process good regulatory compliance   \\nfuture access to research data.  \\n\\nResearch data1 refers to all types of research documents defined in Lund University’s document management plan2, i.e. both those to be preserved and those to be disposed of after a specified retention period. Any disposal must be in accordance with the Swedish National Archives’ regulations. The rules that apply can be found in the document “Gallrings- och bevarandeplan för forskningshandlingar inom de Humanistiska och teologiska fakulteterna” (Disposal and preservation plan for research documents at the Faculties of Humanities and Theology), reg. no V 2019/',\n",
       " 'Storage of research data should also take into account current rules regarding e.g. information and IT security, personal data processing and ethical principles.  \\n\\nDoctoral students’ research documents are considered part of Lund University’s portfolio of public documents and are therefore also covered by these guidelines.  \\n\\nWhen the term “researcher” is used below, it refers all research staff, regardless of the type of employment, and thus also all research students.  \\n\\nThe short-term goal of introducing these procedures is to clarify the organisation’s requirements and expectations of researchers, and to:  \\n\\nsupport researchers in their data management by providing storage space   \\nfor research data during and after the project period   \\nensure that the faculty’s research data can always be found, without help   \\nfrom the researcher   \\nprepare for the possibility of somewhat automatically transferring data and   \\nmetadata to a planned e-archive at Lund University, without requiring each   \\nresearcher to participate in the process  \\n\\nIn addition to having a clearly identified location for research project data3, we need to be able to distinguish between active data and archived data. We also need to organise the data in a structured manner. Long-term preservation must take place in open file formats that make the data accessible even in the long term.  \\n\\nThe legal rights and obligations apply, irrespective of the choice of storage solution. The same rules apply as long as the document is stored with the public authority – regardless of where or how it is stored.  \\n\\nBear in mind that there are other requirements that apply to research data, in addition to these storage guidelines. If, for example, the project processes personal data, this must be reported via the PULU4 form. Ethical review may also be required, etc.  \\n\\nBy following the research data storage procedures below, we also:  \\n\\nsatisfy the Swedish Archives Act’s requirement to preserve and keep research documents organised   \\nare able to link research projects in LUCRIS to their research data   \\nenable secure storage during the project period and prepare for e-archiving ensure that research data remains at LU, even after the researcher’s employment has terminated   \\nenable responding, if necessary, to suspicions of research misconduct by being able to produce evidence in the form of preserved research data facilitate the creation of well-organised data sets that can easily be cited, shared and re-used by the researcher or others to answer new research questions, if needed.  \\n\\n### Research data storage procedures at the Faculties of Humanities and Theology  \\n\\nThe procedures apply to all researchers working at the Faculties of Humanities and Theology and to all research projects that have their main residence at one of the faculty organisations. In brief, this means that the research data during the project period should, and at the end of the project must:  \\n\\nbe stored in a project folder associated with the applicable storage solution be organised according to the standard structure   \\ncontain metadata about the project and its data   \\ncontain the necessary documentation   \\nbe stored in open file format   \\nbe given file names that facilitate understanding of the content   \\nbe disposed of5, if possible, at the end of the retention period.  \\n\\nThe research project manager in charge is also responsible for ensuring that the project’s research data is stored securely throughout the project period and that the right people have access to the project data. You must also ensure that the necessary decisions on disposal/preservation are taken no later than at the end of the project (see below).  \\n\\nBelow are more detailed descriptions of the requirements and related comments.  \\n\\nDuring the project period, the project data must be stored in a work folder specifically intended for the project, in the storage solution provided by the IT unit.  \\n\\nThis ensures secure storage of data during the project period. If another storage solution is chosen, for example, if an equivalent solution is provided by another IT provider, an assessment of information security must be made. In cases where the research data is of such a sensitive nature that the storage solution does not meet all the information security considerations or ethical principles, another storage solution must be chosen',\n",

The research project manager is free to determine the organisation of the data within these folders, but consideration should be given to making the structure understandable and logical for other researchers.  \\n\\nMetadata on the project and its data shall be stored in the Data folder.  \\n\\nAt least one README file shall be placed at the top of the folder. The text should explain what can be found in the folder, how different files relate to each other, etc. in order for other researchers to understand and possibly utilise the research data.  \\n\\nThe minimum requirement for project metadata is based on the “OpenAIRE guidelines for Data Archives”7, which in turn are based on the Dublin Core',\n",
       " 'Metadata is important for future indexing, searching and possibly also statistics. Text elements that are part of the metadata structure must be written in either Swedish or English. The libraries at the Faculties of Humanities and Theology provide a template for this.

The data to be preserved shall be kept separate from the data deemed eligible for disposal.  \\n\\nThe research project manager is responsible for archiving any documents in the project folder that are to be preserved and that a decision on possible disposal is taken no later than at the end of the project period – which does not necessarily coincide with the termination of funding. Decisions on disposal must always be taken in accordance with current regulations (see “Gallrings- och bevarandeplan för forskningshandlingar vid de Humanistiska och teologiska fakulteterna” (Disposal and preservation plan for research documents at the Faculties of Humanities and Theology), reg. no V 2019/2171)10, i.e. disposal of documents requires approval from the head of department.  \\n\\nFor research ethical reasons, research data shall be stored for at least 10 years after publication, in order to enable critical review of the research findings.  \\n\\nIf the project processes personal data, this must be reported to the data protection officer at the end of the project, as the register (the PULU system) must only contain ongoing processing of personal data.  \\n\\nData eligible for disposal are automatically disposed of at the end of the retention period.  \\n\\nAfter assessing the preservation value, which is done in consultation between researchers and the head of department (see above), the IT unit transfers the documents deemed disposable after the retention period by the head of department to the corresponding folder at the intermediate archive of the Faculties of Humanities and Theology. The documents will automatically be disposed of at the end of the retention period. The documents that are to be preserved remain in the project folder, which is then transferred in its entirety to the storage solution for archived material.  \\n\\n#### Further information in related instructions  \\n\\nFor more detailed instructions on how to apply these procedures in practice, for example, which files to store and which file formats are approved, see the Instructions for research data storage at the Faculties of Humanities and Theology (“Anvisningar för forskningsdatalagring vid HT-fakulteterna”).

       " 'Preamble  \\n\\nThe Medical University of Graz (Med Uni Graz) recognises the fundamental importance of research data management, including the importance of maintaining the accompanying records, to ensure high-quality research and scientific integrity. It strives to promote the highest standard in this regard in accordance with the FAIR principles. Accurate, easily retrievable and traceable research data are a fundamental and integral part of any scientific research activity. These data are also essential in that they allow research processes and results to be reviewed and defended, among other things. Research data are of lasting value to research and teaching, opening up the potential for their broad use by members of society.  \\n\\nResearch data shall be handled exclusively in accordance with the applicable national and international legal provisions.  \\n\\nDue to the diversity of research data and processes, it is not possible to define uniform guidelines for the management of research data in detail (e.g. with regard to file structures, repositories, software, metadata). In addition, both the requirements and data management systems develop differently and extremely dynamically in specific research areas. For these reasons, this policy establishes general principles that are independent of research topics and will be continuously adapted as a living document to take into account current developments.',\n",
       " '1. Scope  \\n\\nThis research data management policy refers to the collection, documentation, processing, utilisation, storage and further use of data and applies to all persons working at Med Uni Graz (e.g. researchers, non-scientific employees involved in the research process, students, doctors and employees of the University Hospital Graz and guest researchers) and their research activities. In principle, the policy also applies to those research activities that are promoted, financed, or materially supported by a third party and should be reflected in the corresponding contracts insofar as possible. If questions arise, the provisions established in the specific contract take precedence over the provisions of this policy.',\n",
       " '2. Usage rights  \\n\\nMed Uni Graz is entitled to exercise the unrestricted right to use data generated on behalf of or in the interest of Med Uni Graz for commercial and non-commercial purposes of exploitation with regard to all types of exploitation, including the right to edit these data, without any restrictions in terms of time and place. Section 106 (2) and (3) of the UG (Universities Act, in German: Universitätsgesetz) and the applicable provisions of the Patent Act (in German: Patentgesetz) apply to service inventions. The authors or inventors retain the legally reserved right to be named, the right to receive remuneration for service inventions, the right of university staff to independently publish scientific work and the right to be named as a (co-)author in the publication of research results.',\n",
       " 'MU Medizinische Universitat Graz  \\n\\nInsofar as the primary right to use the data is contractually granted to third legal entities (e.g. in the case of contract research agreements), it must be ensured that Med Uni Graz is in any case granted those rights of disposal over the data that are necessary to fulfil its data storage obligations to support good scientific practice. Furthermore, Med Uni Graz should be granted the right to use the results generated over the course of research activities for non-commercial research, teaching and, if possible, patient care.',\n",
       " 'MU Medizinische Universitat Graz  \\n\\nIn order to comply with data protection regulations, the transfer of personal data to third parties is only permissible if the consent of a data clearing house is provided and with respect to legally compliant contractual agreements. The personal data to be reviewed should also include genetic and biometric data as well as data derived from biological material. The legality of the transfer of personal, pseudonymised, or anonymised data to third parties must be reviewed during the contractual review as part of the third-party funding process. If a data transfer is planned that is not regulated by a project contract, the research management must be informed in order to initiate a separate review, decision and, if necessary, contractual regulation process. The research management also represents the liaison to the Med Uni Graz data protection officer.  \\n\\nWhere possible and appropriate, research data must be provided with a corresponding licence to use the work in order to enable the re-use of these data, provided that no third-party rights, legal obligations, or disposal rights conflict with this re-use. In any case, compliance with any specifications issued by funding agencies regarding the type of licence to be granted must be ensured.',\n",

Basic information  \\n\\nResearch data and their metadata must be kept accurately, completely and reliably in accordance with good scientific practice to ensure the traceability of these data. Furthermore, efforts must be made to ensure the identifiability, findability, availability and, wherever possible, re-usability and interoperability of these data. If possible, the data should be given permanent identifiers.  \\n\\nRecords need to be kept of the methodology used to obtain the data, their processing (such as corrections, calculations, transformations, statistical analyses) and quality control measures. These records are considered as part of the data and should be archived together with these (metadata).  \\n\\nThe retention period for research data and records is – unless other legal regulations apply - dated least ten years either from the date of publishing the research results or, if no publication takes place, from the date of completing the relevant research activity. Justified deviations may result from the legal regulations (e.g. patent law, pharmaceutical law, requirements for the documentation of patient care), the requirements of third-party funding providers, or specific guidelines issued by the Rectorate.  \\n\\nIf research data and records are deleted or destroyed, this must be done in accordance with all legal and internal university requirements and in consideration of the aspect of traceability. The interests of other stakeholders (e.g. funding bodies) as well as aspects of confidentiality and security must be taken into account.  \\n\\nResearch data management must be organised at each organisational unit to ensure that individual persons can find and access certain data but also to guarantee the findability and accessibility of the data, even in the absence of individual persons involved in the research process. In justified cases and in accordance with good scientific practice, it must be ensured that direct access (e.g. for managers, project leaders) or indirect access (e.g. for co-authors of joint manuscripts/publications, project partners, research-supporting institutions, authorities) can be granted to relevant original data.

Data management plans for funded research projects should be deposited in the Research Portal (in German: Forschungsportal). The use of external repositories must be indicated in the data management plan.  \\n\\nIf third parties (e.g. funding bodies or journal editors) make requirements in this regard, research data must be stored and made accessible in a suitable repository, taking aspects of data protection into account.',\n",

This shall not affect patent rights or other rights (of disposal). The authors or inventors retain the legally reserved right to be named, the right to service inventor remuneration, the right of university members to independent publication of scientific work as well as the right to be named as co-author in the publication of research results.  \\n\\nIf the primary right to use the data is contractually granted to a legal entity other than MedUni Vienna (e.g. in the case of contract research agreements), it must be ensured that MedUni Vienna is in any case granted those rights of disposal over the data that are necessary to fulfill its obligation of storing the data. Furthermore, it must be ensured that MedUni Vienna is granted the right to use the results generated in the course of the research activity for non-commercial research and teaching.  \\n\\nIn order to comply with data protection, the transfer of personal data to third parties is only permitted with the consent of the MedUni Vienna's Data Clearing House and in compliance with contractual agreements in compliance with the law. The personal data to be reviewed by the Data Clearing House also include genetic and biometric data as well as data derived from biological material. Furthermore, the Data Clearing House reviews data that has already been anonymized or pseudonymized before it may be passed on to third parties.  \\n\\nIf required by the funding body, research data must be provided with a free license and made openly available for reuse, unless third-party rights, legal obligations or rights of disposal require otherwise.\",\n",

       " \"4.1 General Principles  \\n\\nResearch data must be maintained in an accurate, complete, unaltered and reliable manner. Furthermore, identifiability, retrievability, availability and, wherever possible, reusability and interoperability must be ensured. If possible, the data must be provided with persistent identifiers.  \\n\\nRecords must be kept of the methodology used to obtain the data, its processing (such as corrections, calculations, transformations, statistical analyses), and quality control methods.  \\n\\nThe retention period for research data and records shall be at least ten years either from the publication of the research results or from the completion of the relevant research activity, unless provided otherwise by law. Justified deviations may result from legal provisions (e.g. patent law), requirements of third-party funding bodies or guidelines of the Rectorate.  \\n\\nIf research data and records are deleted or destroyed, this must be done in accordance with all legal and internal university requirements and under the aspect of traceability. The interests of other involved parties (e.g. funding bodies) as well as aspects of confidentiality and security must be taken into account.  \\n\\nResearch data must be made accessible within the MedUni Vienna's area of disposition. If required by third parties (e.g. funding bodies or journal editors), research data must be stored and made accessible in a suitable repository, taking into account data protection. The use of an external repository must be reported to MedUni Vienna by means of a data management plan (DMP).  \\n\\nPersons working at MedUni Vienna (e.g. researchers, staff and students) and other authorized persons (e.g. institutions funding research; authorities) must have access to the original data in order to be able to answer questions that may arise (e.g. for validation, reproducibility and quality assurance).\",\n",
       " '4.2 Handling of Personal Data  \\n\\nPersonal data are also processed in the course of research activities at MedUni Vienna (e.g. data of patients, test persons and employees). Personal data are specially protected by data protection regulations. They must therefore be properly processed and used with due care in accordance with the legal provisions. When dealing with health data, the increased requirements of data protection must be met.  \\n\\nThe Austrian Data Protection Act (Dsg) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDpR) must be obeyed at all times. This applies to the processing of electronic data as well as to information that is not processed automatically (e.g. on paper).  \\n\\nAware of its responsibility, MedUni Vienna has central facilities and internal guidelines (e.g. Good Scientific Practice) that aim to ensure the uniform handling of research data.',\n",

The guidelines are a document that, through support and guidance, facilitates good and effective research data management, in line with the increased demands of different actors. The guidelines complement Mid Sweden University’s policy for research data management (DNR: MIUN 2020/1906). See also our web resource about research data for more information.1',\n",
       " 'Definition of research data  \\n\\nResearch data in this document refers to digital information that has been collected for analysis for a scientific purpose. Examples of research data are statistics and measurement data, transcribed interviews and survey responses, results from experiments, observations from fieldwork, recorded interviews (video/audio) and images.',\n",
       " 'Definition of metadata  \\n\\nMetadata is structured information used to describe and categorise digital information, i.e., “information/data about data”. There are different types of metadata: descriptive, administrative, or structural. Descriptive metadata can be, for example, title or author, administrative metadata can be file formats, licenses, and rights, while structural metadata may be, for example, a static link such as a Digital Object Identifier (DOI).',\n",
       " 'FAIR principles  \\n\\nAt EU and national level, there are requirements for publicly funded research to be made freely available. It includes both scientific publications and related research data. As a result, all research data funded in whole or in part from public funds shall be handled in accordance with the internationally accepted FAIR principles.  \\n\\nManaging research data according to the FAIR principles means making data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable. One benefit of managing data FAIR is that machine readability is considered. FAIR does not automatically mean that data should be made open access, but it should be described and made findable. FAIR data should be “as open as possible, as closed as necessary”.',\n",
       " 'Data Management Plans  \\n\\nMid Sweden University recommends a data management plan for research projects containing research data. Several research funders require data management plans for projects that have been granted funding.  \\n\\nA data management plan is a document that aims to describe in a structured way the management of research data in a project. The data management plan should cover all phases of the project from planning and collecting, creating, or generating data, to analysis, publishing and archiving. The plan makes it easier to keep track of your data during the project and can also make it easier to comply with the FAIR principles. In addition, the data management plan may facilitate the preparation of an ethical review application.  \\n\\nDMPonline is a tool for creating data management plans recommended by research funders, including the Swedish Research Council. Mid Sweden University advises researchers to use DMPonline to create data management plans and offer support, review of data management plans and guidance.2',\n",
       " 'Research data in collaboration with others  \\n\\nThe question of principality and who is responsible for research data can be complicated in collaborative research with other higher education institutions, organisations, private companies or healthcare.  \\n\\nWhen creating a data management plan, agreements should be established between the parties, which govern how the collaboration will work and how research data will be managed within the framework of the project. Agreements in that section may, for example, relate to who is responsible for which data, the handling of sensitive data or the costs associated with the data management.',\n",
       " 'Responsibility for research data  \\n\\nAccording to the definition in the Ethics Review Act (Act on Ethics Review of Human Research (SFS 2003:460)), research principal is a government agency or a natural or legal person in whose activities the research is carried out. It is the research principal who, together with the individual researcher, is legally responsible for ensuring that the activities comply with the rules of the Ethics Review Act. In addition to the responsibility for data management Mid Sweden University is a public authority with archival responsibility.  \\n\\nArchiving legislation constitutes a mandatory legal framework and deals with issues relating to the preservation and deletion of documents at a public authority. It is also the higher education institution that assesses whether certain data should be disclosed upon request in accordance with the principle of public access to official records. Data protection legislation means additional responsibility for the higher education institution in the handling of research data containing personal data.  \\n\\nResearch data collected at Mid Sweden University belongs, as a general rule, to the university and the university therefore has the principal responsibility for data.  \\n\\nThere may be exceptions to the university´s property rights as a result of copyright rules. A document containing data relating to a work protected by copyright may nevertheless be subject to archiving liability, while at the same time subject to copyright protection. The university must consider copyright when applicable.',\n",
       " 'Research data and results  \\n\\nThe Swedish “lärarundantaget” means that patentable inventions produced by university teachers are owned by the inventor. In addition, there are so-called “upphovsrättsliga lärarundantag”, which means that the teacher has the copyright in works produced in the service, such as publications and educational material. Mid Sweden University does not claim patent rights or any other intellectual property rights relating to the results of the research. The researcher is not expected to make research data available until the results of the research are published.  \\n\\nWhat is considered to be research data and research results should in most cases be clear. If questions arise regarding the demarcation between research data and research results, these issues should be addressed in consultation with Mid Sweden University’s support function DAU (Data Access Unit).',\n",
       " 'Making research data accessible according to FAIR  \\n\\nIn what degree research data can be made open access or not is a case-bycase assessment. The assessment may be influenced by provisions in law and by research ethical considerations and carried out in consultation with the DAU function. Such an assessment is made before data have been collected and should be documented in a data management plan for each project.  \\n\\nA funder may require that research data be published openly available to grant applications for research funding, a funder may also have requested that data be treated confidentially. If such an agreement exists, data cannot be made open until any time embargo has expired. Such an agreement does not necessarily affect the possibility for someone to request data based on the principle of public access. In order to deny disclosure of a document or part of a document (data) upon request, the information must be protected by secrecy according in the Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act (SFS 2009:400).  \\n\\nData can be made accessible to varying degrees and still considered to be handled according to the FAIR principles. When data is confidential under the Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act, only metadata can be made available during the period of confidentiality. In other projects, aggregated data may be published openly, while raw data may only be released upon request. There are also projects where all data can and should be open access. It is possible to choose between different levels of accessibility for sharing data. The researcher, in consultation with the project leader, is responsible together with the DAU to indicate the appropriate level. Some examples of reasons why research data cannot be made open access are that it contains personal data, is subject to confidentiality under the Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act, is security protected or that there are ethical aspects that prevent open access to data.',\n",
       " 'Scientific Ethical Consents  \\n\\nWhen research data consists of data from persons participating in a research study, the individuals have normally given their consent for participation in the research. This consent is in some cases limited to the individual research study. Such limited consent constitutes an obstacle to open sharing. If the research participant has consented to the use of research data in other research, it may be made open provided that it does not contain confidential information. Such data may, for example, be sensitive personal data.',\n",
       " 'Research data as a public document  \\n\\nResearch data within the University’s activities is archived and can then be requested by everyone as a public document. The right of access to official documents is restricted by secrecy. It is therefore the secrecy rules that limit what can be kept confidential if someone requests access to stored research data. The question whether or not to make research data open access is relevant for dissemination and re-use, but it does not affect the question whether research data is public or confidential.',\n",
       " 'Information security  \\n\\nInformation security is about protecting information from various types of threats, such as transparency from unauthorised persons or distortion of information. In accordance with the FAIR principles, research data shall be as open as possible but as closed as necessary while protecting all data from leaking, distorting or destroying. A security system for data protection consists of three different parts: a technical, a physical and an organizational. The three parts shall complement each other and create a secure system.  \\n\\nResearch data shall be handled in such a way as to ensure that the information is protected against unauthorised access (confidentiality), inaccurate changes (property), and that the information is accessible when needed (accessibility). It is also important to ensure that the information is not altered, sought, or disclosed to anyone who is not authorised to consult it.  \\n\\nInformation classification is an important part of achieving good information security for your research data. The information classification is crucial for which storage space can be used for the management of research data. At Mid Sweden University there are guidelines for how information classification should be done, see Modell för klassificering av information DNR: MIUN 2020/2488.',\n",
       " 'Preservation and deletion of research data  \\n\\nResearch data shall be preserved and archived for as long as possible, but in some cases, it may be allowed to delete data earlier. Current information and valid deletion decisions can be found on Mid Sweden University’s web.',\n",

Early notification is through the ethical review process; it is from this that the institution is able to ensure proper data governance and oversight.  \\n\\n### Ethical Review  \\n\\nThe University is clear that research involving the access, collection and use of securitysensitive materials carries a risk to researchers as well as the general public and therefore any such research should go through full ethical review.  \\n\\nThe University operates a two stage ethical review process for all its research. Within the preliminary stage, section six relates to data. The researcher should answer ‘Yes’ to the question.',\n",

Before beginning the research, a member of NUITs Information Security Team should be contacted, they will arrange for the set-up of an appropriately secure project drive. Material within this drive will be easy to access but in some cases there will may restrictions preventing its exchange.  \\n\\nLikewise if the research involves visiting security-sensitive websites, the researcher should be aware that many of these sites are under surveillance by the authorities. It is strongly recommended that their University profile (IP address) is used to access these sites, thereby ensuring that their activities are flagged as being a legitimate part of their research and ensure that enquiries come to the institution in the first instance.  \\n\\nPhysical data, e.g. manuals / reports should be scanned and a copy uploaded to the secure project file store.  \\n\\nBy using a secure file store (along with appropriate ethics approval) the researcher will ensure that, should the University be asked, it can confirm that the materials within it are for research.

       " 'Research Data Management Policy',\n",
       " '1 Introduction/Context  \\n\\nThe effective management of research data is becoming increasingly important.  UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) has affirmed that making research data available to users is a core part of its remit.  UKRI’s Common Principles on Data Policy1 states that ‘Publicly funded research data are a public good, produced in the public interest, which should be made openly available with as few restrictions as possible in a timely and responsible manner that does not harm intellectual property.’  \\n\\nNorthumbria University recognises that data from its research should be wellmanaged to benefit the researcher, the University and the wider community.  As such, there is an obligation to record, store and archive research data appropriately, in a way that is proportionate in terms of security and retention, and allows for sharing of data to contribute to the impact of the research.  It is recognised that types of data used, collected and generated will vary between different disciplines. The approach taken in this policy is to be sensitive to these differences while ensuring that good practice is promoted and funder requirements are met.  \\n\\nThis policy should be read in conjunction with other University policies, notably the Records Management Policy2, the Research Ethics and Governance Handbook3, and the Data Protection Policy4.',\n",
       " '2 Scope  \\n\\nThe policy applies to all research conducted by staff and postgraduate research students at the University, regardless of whether it is funded or unfunded.  The policy does not normally apply to activities such as surveys used to improve service provision, conducted by Students’ Union or Service Departments, or to undergraduate work, unless it is included in scholarly publications.',\n",
       " '3 Definition of Research  \\n\\nResearch in the context of this policy is based on the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) Research Excellence Framework (REF) 2014 definition, contained in Annex C of the ‘Assessment Framework and Guidance on Submissions’5, which defines research as ‘a process of investigation leading to new insights, effectively shared.’  It includes work of direct relevance to the needs of commerce, industry, and to the public and voluntary sectors; scholarship; the invention and generation of ideas, images, performances, artefacts including design, where these lead to new or substantially improved insights; and the use of existing knowledge in experimental development to produce new or substantially improved materials, devices, products and processes, including design and construction. It excludes routine testing and routine analysis of materials, components and processes such as for the maintenance of national standards, as distinct from the development of new analytical techniques. It also excludes the development of teaching materials that do not embody original research.',\n",
       " '4 Definition of Research Data  \\n\\nFor the purposes of this policy, research data refers to any material collected, observed or created for the purpose of analysis and on which research conclusions are based.  Research data may be numerical, descriptive or visual, and can be digital, paper-based or in other forms.',\n",
       " '5 Definition of Researcher  \\n\\nFor the purposes of this policy, researchers are defined as members of the University, including all staff and postgraduate research (PGR) students, and those conducting research on University premises or using University facilities.  \\n\\nThe policy excludes Postgraduate Taught and Undergraduate students, unless their research findings are included in scholarly publications.',\n",
       " '6 Governance  \\n\\ni) The policy is approved by Research and Knowledge Exchange Committee, and monitored through the Research Data Management Working Group. ii) The policy will be reviewed annually.',\n",
       " '7 Principles  \\n\\nThe principles which underpin the use and management of research data by University staff and students are set out below. These principles are consistent with the principles of data protection set out in Article 5 of the General Data Protection Regulation6 and satisfy the requirements in Schedule 1, Part 4, 39 of the UK Data Protection Act 2018:  \\n\\ni) Research data will be managed throughout the research data lifecycle7 in accordance with the University’s policies, guidelines and standards, and funder, legislative and ethical requirements.   \\nii) Research data shall in most cases be collected for the purposes of creating new knowledge which is shared with others through publication and dissemination. In these cases, research is normally deemed to be ‘a task in the public interest’ (principles of lawfulness and purpose limitation Art.6 GDPR). In cases where special category data are being processed, then an additional condition will apply. For most research carried out by the University  \\n\\nthis will normally be that processing is necessary for ‘scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes’ (GDPR Art.9).  \\n\\niii) Data management plans should be written for all new research projects, regardless of whether submission of such plans is required when applying for research funding.  The plan must address how the data will be captured, managed, stored, retained, shared, published, and how any confidentiality and data protection issues will be addressed.8 See also Section 10 for further guidance on data management plans.  \\n\\niv) Personally identifiable data should be anonymised or pseudonymised where possible as soon after collection as possible. Where researchers can undertake some or all of their research activities without using identifiable personal data, they should make arrangements to do so (principle of data minimisation). Where research requires the processing of personal data, and where the University is the data controller, then there must be a clear legal basis for processing and this must be communicated to the data subject (principle of lawfulness, fairness and transparency).9  \\n\\nv) Where personal data are stored and processed for research purposes by University staff this must be carried out in accordance with the University’s information security policy (principle of integrity and confidentiality).10  \\n\\nvi) Data should be made available for access and re-use where legally, ethically and commercially appropriate.  \\n\\nvii) Researchers must provide sufficient metadata and explanatory documentation about their research data to ensure that data are discoverable, understandable and re-useable.  Such metadata will be published by the University, normally within 12 months of the data being generated.  If access to data is restricted, the metadata should outline the reasons for this and the conditions which need to be met for access to be granted.  \\n\\nviii) Data must be retained in an appropriate format for a period of at least 1 year from the end of the project for low risk projects, 3 years for moderate risk projects and 7 years for high risk projects, in accordance with the University’s Research Records Retention Schedule (principle of storage limitation)11, unless other funder regulations apply (for example, EPSRC stipulates a retention period of 10 years, plus an additional 10 from the last date at which access to the data was requested by a third party).  Where possible and applicable, research data that are not in a digital format will be digitised to facilitate access.  \\n\\nix) Where possible, or if mandated by the funder, retained data must be submitted to an appropriate archive or database for long-term preservation.  \\n\\nResearchers should avoid retaining data using methods that might not persist for 10 years, such as project websites.  \\n\\nx) All data which are created as part of research at Northumbria University must be registered with the University, even if the data are hosted elsewhere.  All reasonable steps must be taken to ensure that research data are not stored in a jurisdiction that offers lower levels of protection than are available in the UK.  \\n\\nxi) Published papers should include a statement describing how, and on what terms, supporting research data may be accessed.',\n",
       " '8 Data Management Responsibilities  \\n\\ni) The most senior Northumbria researcher associated with a research project (whether funded or unfunded) is the Data Lead for that project and is ultimately responsible and accountable for research data management within that project.  \\n\\nii) For funded projects, the Data Lead will normally be the Principal Investigator.  \\n\\niii) For Postgraduate Research Students, the Data Lead will normally be the Principal Supervisor.  \\n\\niv) The Data Lead is responsible for ensuring that all research staff and students working on a project are aware of the University’s data management policy and supporting guidelines and procedures, and for reviewing data management plans annually.  The Data Lead may assign specific data management responsibilities to other researchers on a project.  \\n\\nv) In the absence of the Data Lead, responsibility for research data management devolves to the department Research and Innovation Lead.  \\n\\nvi) Stakeholders and Services across the University will work together to create a robust infrastructure for the research data lifecycle.',\n",
       " '9 Implementation and Communication  \\n\\ni) The University will provide training, support, advice and guidance regarding research data management through the researcher development training programme (including the PGR training programme) and web-based guidance.  \\n\\nii) The University will provide mechanisms and services for storage, backup, registration and retention of research data during a research project and after its completion.',\n",

This includes tools to ensure the stored Research Data is discoverable and accessible. Once a project has closed, the Research Data should be offered and assessed for preservation in NTU supported repository.   \\n3.4.2 On project completion, the Principal Investigator is responsible for data transformation or format conversion required to archive and access the Research Data.   \\n3.4.3 On project completion, the Principal Investigator should ensure all relevant Research Data is made available in the location specified in the data management plan.  \\n\\n3.5 Any Research Data which is to be retained elsewhere, for example in an international data service or domain repository should be registered with NTU. The registration must include the retention and access policy of the relevant data service to help determine compliance with this Policy.  \\n\\n3.6 Principal Investigators are responsible for ensuring that any external Research Data to be incorporated into their research is registered with NTU. The registration must include the retention and access policy governing the Research Data to help determine compliance with this Policy.  \\n\\n3.7 Research data management plans must ensure that research Data are available for access and re-use where appropriate and under appropriate safeguards.  \\n\\n3.8 Principal Investigators are responsible for deciding, subject to legal, ethical and commercial constraints, which Research Data are to be released to meet their obligations. Research Data shall be released for access and re-use as soon as practicable after research activity is completed and results published.  \\n\\n3.9 The privacy and other legitimate interests of the subjects of Research Data must be protected.  \\n\\n3.10 Research Data of future historical interest, and all Research Data that represent records of NTU, including data that substantiate research findings, will be offered and assessed for deposit and retention in an appropriate national or international data service or domain repository, or an NTU repository.  \\n\\n3.11 As a basic principle NTU should retain the right to use its Research Data and outputs for its own teaching and non-commercial research purposes.  Exclusive rights to reuse or publish Research Data should not be granted to commercial publishers or agents without retaining the rights to make the data openly available for re-use. Where the granting of such exclusive rights is a requirement of the funder, advice should be sought from NTU’S Legal Services Team to ensure that NTU can comply with its obligations under charity law.  \\n\\n3.12 If Research Data is to be deleted or destroyed, either because the agreed retention period has expired or for legal or ethical reasons, this should be done so in accordance with all legal, ethical, research funder and collaborator requirements with particular attention to confidentiality and security.  \\n\\nNTU has a range of policy documents and guidance which offers advice and sets out the regulations pertaining to a number of areas, some of which may impact on the Research Data Management Policy:  \\n\\nCode of Practice for Research Professional Standards in research Legal Agreements and Intellectual Property IT Security policy Staff Disciplinary Procedures  \\n\\n# 5 DOCUMENT GOVERNANCE  \\n\\n5.1 Responsibilities  \\n\\nPolicy Owner Pro-Vice Chancellor for Research  \\n\\n5.2 Version Control and Change History  \\n\\n Version ApprovalDate Approved By Amendment \\n1.0 30/06/2014 26/03/2015 SeniorManagement tTeam University NewPolicy \\n1.1 ResearchCommittee 3.3.Additionofdateof adoption.',\n",

       " \"Data Management Principles  \\n\\nResearch data must be retained and disposed of securely according to the relevant retention and disposal schedule.  This can be found at:  \\n\\nRecords Retention Policy  \\n\\n7.2 Research data that underpins published results or is considered to have long-term value should be retained.  The default period for research data retention is 10 years from date of last requested access. However, retention periods should, as a minimum, conform to the requirements of a funding agency or body.  \\n\\n7.3 Retained data must be deposited in an appropriate data service, or as mandated by the funder or otherwise directed.  \\n\\nA statement describing how and on what terms any supporting data may be accessed must be included in research outputs.  \\n\\n7.5 Where research is undertaken in partnership or under contract with a third party, a collaboration agreement must be signed before the start of the research that clearly addresses data ownership and partner responsibility for data storage.  \\n\\n7.6 Data placed on temporary storage must be transferred back onto the approved storage platform as detailed in the DMP as soon as the requirement for temporary storage has ended.  \\n\\n7.7 Research proposals should consider whether storage requirements may exceed those currently offered by the University.  Any such potential requirement should be discussed in advance of the application with both IT and the RDM Working Group.  \\n\\n7.8 Before staff leave the university, data of long-term value produced using University resources must remain accessible to the University.  Ownership of the data should be transferred to another member of staff on agreement of the Head of Division.  \\n\\n7.9 At the completion of a project, the PI must assess what data are of long-term value, and whether the data can be made openly available in a manner consistent with relevant legal, ethical and regulatory frameworks.  \\n\\n7.10 If research data are to be deleted or destroyed, this should be done in accordance with all legal, ethical and funder requirements and only after the written approval of the Head of Division.  \\n\\n7.11 Retained data suitable for external access should be stored on QMU's institutional data repository, eData unless an alternative is mandated by the funder.  \\n\\nLibrary Services manages QMU's open-access data repository, eData.  It exists to preserve datasets that support research outputs published by QMU researchers, as required by funder or publisher mandates, and to maximise their sharing and reuse.  \\n\\nDatasets shared in eData should be used in accordance with the Terms in the QMU  \\n\\nRepositories Policy.   \\n7.12 After a project, a metadata record describing retained data must be made publicly available within 12 months of the project completion.   \\n7.13 Metadata and documentation about research data should provide sufficient contextual information to enable the data to be discovered, accessed, understood, interpreted and reused by future users.   \\n7.14 If access to the data is restricted, the published metadata should provide the reasons for the restrictions and summarise the conditions that must be satisfied for access to be granted.   \\n7.15 All users of research datasets should acknowledge the sources of their data and abide by the terms and conditions under which they were accessed, in order to recognise the intellectual contributions of research teams and supporting organisations.   \\n7.16 Research data must be managed throughout its lifecycle in compliance with relevant legislation.   \\n7.17 Unless there are ethically and legally justified reasons for doing otherwise, researchers working with human subjects must ensure that they have an auditable record of each study participant’s explicit informed consent. to obtain, hold and use their personal data as per research ethics guidance.   \\n8 Cloud Storage   \\n8.1 For the purposes of this policy, ‘Cloud’ storage refers to third party web-based data storage such as Microsoft OneDrive, Google Drive, Dropbox etc.   \\n8.1 No cloud storage services should be used to store research data other than the University provided OneDrive account, unless mandated by the funder or statutory body.   \\n8.2 Personal OneDrive accounts should not be used to store or access research data. Only accounts linked to QMU credentials should be used.   \\n8.3 Prior to research staff leaving the employment of QMU, data stored in their OneDrive account should be transferred to an existing member of staff’s account as directed by the Head of Division.  This is to avoid loss of access to data.  \\n\\nAdvice can be sought from IT if required via the Helpdesk assist@qmu.ac.uk.  \\n\\n8.4 Care must be taken when sharing data via OneDrive to ensure continuation of data security and privacy.  \\n\\n8.5 Multi Factor Authentication should be enabled for access to the OneDrive folder on any connected device.

       " '# Research Data Access and Management Policy  \\n\\n## 1  Background  \\n\\nA 2008 HEFCE-funded report defines research data as “the evidence base on which academic researchers build their analytic or other work.” Data management, including planning for long-term storage and sharing, is an increasingly important aspect of the UK Research funding environment. Most grant applications for research which will generate digital data sets require a data management plan that meets the 2011 Research Councils UK (RCUK) policy; this states that: ‘Publicly funded research data are a public good, produced in the public interest, which should be made openly available with as few restrictions as possible in a timely and responsible manner that does not harm intellectual property:’   \\n   \\n\\nAs of May 2012, RCUK required all funded universities to have a data management policy and road map in place, that will be fully implemented by 2015 to meet their expectations for data sharing, as follows:  \\n\\npublicly funded research data should be made openly available in a timely manner;   \\ndata with acknowledged long term value should be made accessible;   \\nRCUK recognises that there are legal, ethical and commercial constraints on release of research data. To ensure that the research process is not damaged by inappropriate release of data, research organisation policies and practices should ensure that these are considered at all stages in the research process;   \\nResearch Council funded work may be entitled to a limited period of privileged use of the data.  \\n\\nA summary of funder data management/sharing requirements can be found here:    \\n\\n## 2  Guidelines for researchers on Open Data',\n",

       "['Aalto University Research Data Management Policy  \\n\\nThe research data management policy aims to make data management easier for the individual researcher. Managing and curating data creates competitive edge, and allocating resources for that is a strategic choice of the university. The purposes of this policy are to (1) encourage to informed decision making in research data management and (2) define the principles used in the opening of publicly funded scientific research data to achieve wide societal impact and the strategic goals of Aalto University.  \\n\\nThe data management policy shall be implemented through conscious and strategic decisions. Open access publishing of research data aims to make research data easily discoverable, assessable, intelligible, usable and interoperable. Where applicable, these requirements can also be applied to data other than open access published research data, and to the software needed to handle the open data. The decisions to publish software, other than the software explicitly needed to handle the data, are done using the same conscious and strategic grounds as opening of the research data.  \\n\\nOwnership of copyright protected research data is transferred to Aalto University if the data is created in an externally funded research project of Aalto University.  Strategic decisions about opening such data are done by the principal investigators. These decisions are done following the guidelines for ethical principles of research as well as the guidelines for responsible conduct of research, project agreements and guidelines for processing of personal data in scientific research,   \\n   \\n\\nResearch data is not opened if the opening would violate privacy, safety, security, terms of project agreements or legitimate concerns of private partners. Researchers shall follow the \"Guideline on nondisclosure of information and information security classification at Aalto University\" and its appendix \"Rules on the handling of information materials\".    \\n\\nWhen deciding on the opening of research data, the possibilities for commercially exploiting the research results and data are taken into consideration. Aalto University will make agreements about the user rights of third parties according to the strategic goals of the university. Aalto University may also charge a fee from third parties for the use of research data.  \\n\\nOpenness of scientific research data will increase the scientific impact of the research, speed up the adoption of research findings and the creation of innovations, enable transparency in science, as well as ensure that research data has wide societal impact and usability in solving global challenges.  \\n\\nOpening access to research data shall be made easy for researchers and implemented in a cost-effective manner so that the resources invested are proportioned to the benefits attainable.

       " '# Brunel University Research Data Management Policy  \\n\\nResearchers and the University have obligations to preserve, store and provide access to research outputs, including research data. Demonstrable good practice in research data management and a commitment to data sharing are increasingly required by funding organisations and research partners. There are also benefits for the University and individual researchers: increased research impact and profile; wider benefits for the research community and the public; advancement of knowledge; opportunities for growth.  \\n\\nThe following policy supports the Brunel University Research Data Management Vision, which was approved by Senate in March 2012 and forms part of the University’s research integrity code of practice.  \\n\\n## Vision  \\n\\nResearch data management is the planning, capture, review, publication, storage, preservation and re-use of data produced by research, irrespective of format.  \\n\\nThe University views effective research data management as an essential ingredient of a high quality research culture.   \\nIt assumes that all data produced by University researchers will be made available to the wider academic community, except where the right of individual researchers, or the subjects of the research, would be compromised by such release.   \\nThe University provides training, support, advice and information to support effective research data management.   \\nResearch data management is a shared responsibility. Individual researchers, academic units and central departments work together to develop research data management plans and implement them throughout the research life cycle.   \\nAll research proposals include an integral research data management plan.   \\nThe University actively supports the collection, storage, retention and cataloguing of all its research data (both raw and published) and promotes its re-use by other researchers where appropriate and with due safeguards.   \\nResearch data management policies safeguard the interests of participants in the research, the researchers and the University by facilitating compliance with relevant legislation.   \\nAll research data is stored securely and is registered with the University. Data is stored in the data centres of higher educational institutions or in subject-specific data services.   \\nAll University policies, including those on Intellectual Property, Good Research Practice and the Procedures for Investigation of Research Misconduct, support good practice in research data management.  \\n\\n   \\n\\nThis policy will continue to evolve in line with the changing research environment, in consultation with the research community.  \\n\\n# Policy  \\n\\n## Scope of applicability  \\n\\nResearch data is defined as the evidence base on which academic researchers build their analytic or other work (HEFCE, 2008).  \\n\\nThis policy applies in the first instance to academic staff and postgraduate research students (PGRs). It is expected that data generated by undergraduate (UG), postgraduate taught students (PGTs) and non-academic staff in the normal course of study or administration will normally be exempt from this policy, except where any of the following applies:  \\n\\na. data is generated in connection with an eligible research project, eg funded in whole or in part by Research Councils UK (RCUK), or other public body;   \\nb. the data is generated under a contract of employment with the University, or other agreement (such as a Non-Disclosure/Confidentiality Agreement with a research sponsor / partner;   \\nc. the individual staff member or student has formally published research outputs (conference proceedings, articles, monographs) from the data, in affiliation with Brunel University or jointly-authored with Brunel University staff.  \\n\\nThe terms of this policy will apply in this instance. Staff and students who are uncertain as to whether the policy applies to their situation can contact researchdata@brunel.ac.uk for guidance.  \\n\\n## Managing research data  ',\n",
       " 'The University will develop and provide guidance, training and support regarding research  \\n\\ndata management: researchdata@brunel.ac.uk See also information on the Library website and RSDO ata ownership 8. Researchers should clarify the ownership of any datasets which are used or generated and of derivative IP for all research projects or ventures generated in collaborations or partnerships, at the proposal stage or by the start of a project.  Researchers are invited to seek advice from: researchdata@brunel.ac.uk 9. Where research data is generated wholly by the researcher, data ownership will normally belong to the University and/or the research funder.  Researchers are invited to seek advice at the proposal stage or by the start of a project from: researchdata@brunel.ac.uk 10. Where all the researchers working on a publicly funded research project are from HE institutions, it is expected that institutional policies will be derived from RCUK policy and expectations and will be similar in principle. While the lead institution and Principal Investigator (PI)will have overall responsibility for ensuring that research data is made available appropriately, and will do so in line with the relevant institutional policy, where this is not Brunel, no conflict with University policy is expected. 11. Where research data is generated in cross-sector collaborations or where third party data is used, data ownership and management can be very complex.  Researchers working within cross-sector collaborations with industry partners should pay particular attention to data ownership and derivative IP generated to ensure that as a minimum, data which underpins a research publication they produce may be published or deposited in an open access data archive.  Researchers are invited to seek advice from University research support services and should contact researchdata@brunel.ac.uk in the first instance. 12. Researchers should abide by the conditions set by the data owner/s, in particular relating to data confidentiality and sharing. Where this is in conflict with University and/or funder policy on data sharing, they should seek guidance from RSDO and/or the Library who will advise further. 13. Ownership information for all data generated or modified should be recorded in the metadata or embedded within datasets as appropriate. 14. Where data ownership must be transferred to a third party, researchers must retain sufficient rights to make research data openly available for reuse, unless this contravenes funder requirements or conditions of data owners. 15. Researchers must not give away exclusive rights to publish, reuse or store research data to third parties, unless doing so is a condition of funding (eg for reasons of confidentiality, research  ethics). If so, researchers should seek advice in the first instance. 16. Researchers who leave the University to work at another HEI while a research project is ongoing may generally expect to retain access to datasets for the duration of the project: each case may need individual consideration as to the most appropriate way to achieve this. RCUK policy takes precedence, and data must be made available alongside any research publications which are published in affiliation with the University.  In some instances, it may be appropriate for data to be transferred, such as where the research project will be moving to another institution. Researchers should seek advice from researchdata@brunel.ac.uk.  \\n\\nData storage and sharing   ',\n",
       " 'Responsibilities of the Researchers  \\n\\n11 Researchers are responsible for ensuring that all research data is managed in compliance with this policy and the UK GDPR requirements. This includes the proper documentation, storage, and sharing of data, as well as ensuring that the legitimate interests of research participants are protected at all times. This includes, but is not limited to, seeking informed consent for the recording of personal data and ensuring that data is not shared with an individual or organisation not bound by the UK GDPR or equivalent legislation.  Researchers should seek advice from the Research and  \\n\\nEnterprise Directorate, Digital Technical Services and University Research Ethics Panel when uncertainties arise.  \\n\\n2 The responsibility for data management for any research project lies with the most senior researcher associated with the project.  \\n\\n13 Researchers must also:  \\n\\nProtect confidential, personal, and/or sensitive research data in accordance with the legal and ethical requirements related to the research they conduct. Ensure that ownership of research data and any intellectual property is in accordance with the BNU Intellectual Property Policy and that said ownership is properly established before the start of a project.   \\nCreate and adhere to Data Management Plans (DMPs) for research projects in line with funders’ requirements. All plans should address data capture, documentation and metadata, ethical and legal compliance, storage and backup, and selection of data for long term storage. DMP Online provides an online tool to support the creation of Data Management Plans.   \\nDeposit their data in an appropriate data repository and provide sufficient information (such as a metadata record) to ensure that it can be found, understood, and cited. Where data is deposited somewhere other than BNU’s institutional repository (BNU Knowledge Archive), a metadata record should also be created in the BNU repository which describes and points to the data. External repositories, where used, should support the use of Open Researcher and Contributor IDs (ORCIDs) and Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs).   \\nShare data in accordance with the principles of open access (see BNU’s Open Access Policy).   \\nWhere possible, researchers should seek to recover any cost associated with research data management from the funding body.  \\n\\n14 All research data must be registered with the University whether it is hosted by the University or retained elsewhere. Researchers are responsible for informing the Research and Enterprise Directorate of the location of the data and who will have access to it. BNU retains the right to store a copy of the data for an acceptable period to ensure regulatory or contractual compliance. Guidance on how to register data with BNU, is available on the Research Data Management pages of the staff intranet.  \\n\\n15 Data should be preserved in accordance with the project specific Data Management Plan, which will outline specific retention periods. These periods may vary depending on the nature of the data and the requirements of specific research projects, as discussed in section 8. The Records Retention Schedule provides guidance on the preservation of data.  \\n\\n16 Not all research data is suitable for long term preservation, for example data which contains highly sensitive personal information that cannot be adequately anonymised, when consent has been withdrawn, or when legal or ethical constraints dictate otherwise. The Classifying Information section on the staff intranet provides guidance on this. Staff can also consult with the University Ethics Panel and the Research and Enterprise Directorate to determine appropriate actions in these cases.',\n",
       " '4. Storage, retention and sharing of data: expectations  \\n\\n4.1 The production of open research data is acknowledged as a legitimate output of the research process. This being the case, research data produced by Cardiff Metropolitan University will be accurate, complete and reliable and every effort will be taken to ensure data are identifiable and retrievable, and openly available where appropriate.  Data shall be stored in a manner compliant with legal and ethical obligations as well as any requirements specific to the funder of the research.  Where issues of confidentiality and/or anonymity arise, these shall be of paramount importance when considering how and where data will be stored and made available.  \\n\\n4.2 Data will be stored in a secure repository suited to the data set concerned. Where data are stored in an external repository, full details of the location of the data will be registered with the institution and details will be attached to any relevant publications by the Library.  \\n\\n4.3 Data supporting and underlying published research outputs will, wherever possible, be made available upon publication of the output and will be preserved for an appropriate period.  To enable this, sufficient metadata will be recorded and made available to enable others to understand the research and re-use potential of the data. Published outputs will include information on how to access the supporting data.  \\n\\n4.4 The minimum period for retention of research data will be ten years from the date of publication.  However where the funder of the research requires a longer retention period, this will be adhered to.  \\n\\n4.5 Retention periods will be decided as part of the Data Management planning exercise. Once the initial retention period as stated in the Data Management Plan has lapsed, a review will take place to assess whether the data should be retained for a further period.  Data with acknowledged long-term value will be preserved and remain accessible and usable for future research.  Conversely, data which has attracted little interest for more than ten years will not be expected to be retained.  \\n\\n4.6 The storage of outputs and data derived from undergraduate or taught post graduate research projects will be subject to the expectations of this policy where it is the intention to publish the results of the research.  In cases where there is no intention to publish, the storage of the outputs and data will be governed by the regulatory arrangements of the relevant award.  \\n\\n4.7 It is recognised that there are instances where it is necessary to restrict access to research data however, any access restrictions placed on data must be justified and justifiable.  It is anticipated that such restrictions will be related to the maintenance of confidentiality, the protection of the privacy of research participants, commercial sensitivity or issues related to IP.  \\n\\n4.8 Where confidentiality provisions apply, data will be kept in a way that reference to them by third parties can occur without breaching such confidentiality.  Confidentiality agreements to protect intellectual property rights may be agreed between the institution, the researcher and a sponsor of the research. Where such agreements limit free publication and discussion, limitations and restrictions must be explicitly agreed.',\n",
       " 'Obtaining Consent  \\n\\nResearchers should normally carry out investigations with the valid consent of participants having taken all reasonable and practicable steps to ensure that they, or their authorized representatives, have adequately understood the nature of the research and any anticipated consequences. Under no circumstances must coercion be used to obtain a person’s consent to participate in research. Ideally consent should be obtained in writing but where this is not possible oral consent should be obtained.  \\n\\n#### 5.1 Informed Consent  \\n\\n5.1.1 Informed consent is a process by which a prospective participant, prior to participating in research:  \\n\\n(i) Is fully informed about all aspects of the research project, which might reasonably be expected to influence willingness to participate. In addition, the researcher must explain all other aspects of the research about which the prospective participants enquire. Such aspects will include some or all of the following:  \\n\\n• the nature and objectives of the project   \\n• the methodology of the project and conditions under which it is to be conducted   \\n• the persons/institutions that will have access to personally identifiable information about participants   \\n• the form in which research results will be published/communicated (e.g. aggregate statistical form)   \\n• who is undertaking and who is sponsoring the project   \\n• the potential risks and inconveniences that may arise   \\n• the potential benefits that may result • what participation in the research will require   \\n• whether it will be possible, and if yes, until what point, to withdraw from participation (ii) Freely and voluntarily gives consent to participating.  \\n\\n5.1.2 In case where, due to the nature of the research, informed consent is possible only after the researched situation is over, the researchers should obtain the consent as soon as the situation is over and when the participants do not consent the records of the situation should be destroyed in the presence of the participants.  \\n\\n5.1.3 Giving and obtaining consent can be a process, not always a one-off event and participants have the right to change their minds and withdraw consent at any time. However, if the withdrawal of consent occurs at the time when it affects the possibility of the finalization of the research (for instance, shortly before publication or thesis defense), the withdrawal should result only in the deletion of all personally identifiable data of the participant both in published materials and in stored and processed research data. If a researcher doubts whether a person participating in research still consents to participating s/he must clarify this with the person in question.  \\n\\n5.1.4 If the prospective participant is, for any reason, unable to understand the implications of participation, then the researcher is responsible for obtaining the informed consent of the parents/legal guardians of the prospective participant.  \\n\\n#### 5.2 Coercion  \\n\\n5.2.1 Where a relationship exists between the researcher and participant (e.g. employees, patients, students or anyone in a dependence relation) careful consideration as to the nature of consent is required. Willingness to volunteer may be unduly influenced by the expectation of benefits or rewards. When research is being conducted with detained persons (e.g. prisoners) particular care must be taken over informed consent, paying particular attention to the special circumstances that may affect the person’s ability to freely and voluntarily give informed consent.  \\n\\n5.2.2 People volunteering to participate in research may be paid for their inconvenience and time (taking into account the practices of a given academic discipline). Payments made to individuals must not be so large as to induce the individuals to risk harm beyond that which they would usually undertake. Financial payments might cover reimbursement for travel expenses and / or time. Risks resulting from participation must be acceptable to participants even in the absence of inducement.  \\n\\n5.2.3 The promise of compensation and care for damage, injury or loss of income as a result of participating in research activities to participants should not be considered coercion by inducement.  \\n\\n#### 5.3 Research Involving Incompetent Adults  \\n\\n5.3.1 Where a prospective participant is unable to give informed consent to participate a ‘legal representative’ may give assent on his/her behalf (in case of uncertainty the researchers should seek professional advice on the competence of participants). The person unable to give consent should still receive information according to their capacity to understand, setting out the risks and benefits of participating in the research.  \\n\\n5.3.2 In the case of an adult this could be a person designated by the adult, a relative or an independent person nominated by, for example, the hospital at which the research is being undertaken. If the adult has appointed a representative who is available, then this person must be used to give assent. A relative can only be used if the person has not appointed a representative or if the representative is not available. An independent person should only be used if both the adult’s representative and a relative are not available.  \\n\\n#### 5.4 Research Involving Children  \\n\\n5.4.1 Research involving children exists within both a legal framework and a more traditional context. The following guidance seeks to facilitate research involving children within a legal environment whilst respecting and taking into consideration the traditional and sometimes more formal guidance/procedures many settings may have. Laws of the country where the research takes place should be applied in determining whether participants in the research are children.  \\n\\n5.4.2 Parents (and others with parental responsibility) may agree to their children taking part in research, but where a child is able to understand sufficiently to give informed consent, their consent should be obtained in addition to parents’.  \\n\\n5.4.3 It is the researcher\\'s responsibility to assess whether the child has sufficient understanding to consent to the research. Children’s capacity to consent to research depends on their understanding of the research to be undertaken. Where information about the research and study can be given clearly and simply, it is possible for quite young children to consent to take part in research.  \\n\\n5.4.4 For a child to give valid consent they would need to understand the nature of the engagement with the researcher and understand that it is different to other interactions with those who may seek information from the child. Particularly, the child must be able to understand that the researcher is not able to make decisions about their life, and will use the information the child provides, but not in a way which would allow others to identify the child.  \\n\\n5.4.5 Where a researcher wishes to include children in a study whom he/she considers is not mature enough to decide about participation he/she must obtain the agreement of at least one person who has parental responsibility for the child before engaging them in any research activity.  \\n\\n5.4.6 Where children are considered competent by a researcher to participate they should be accorded the confidentiality as would an adult. There are however two areas of concern where the same level of confidentially cannot be promised to a child: where a child discloses that they are being seriously harmed or ill-treated, or where the researcher discovers a condition about which the parents could take action to benefit the child. In these instances researchers could be seen to have a duty of care to disclose such information to relevant third parties.  \\n\\n5.4.7 In the case of research in educational settings, any special school policies or procedures must be followed and efforts made to fully inform those responsible for children in these settings of the purpose and benefits of any proposed research with children.  \\n\\n#### 5.5 Research in Public Contexts and With Groups  \\n\\n5.5.1 In certain types of research obtaining consent from every individual participating is impractical or unfeasible (e.g. observing a large crowd or observing discussions on the internet). In such types of research researchers must ensure the following:  \\n\\n(i) That such research is only carried out in public contexts;   \\n(ii) That no details that could identify specific individuals are given in any reports on the research unless reporting on public figures acting in their public capacity (e.g. reporting a speech by a named individual);   \\n(iii) That unless those observed give their consent to be observed, observational research should only occur where those observed would expect to be observed by strangers.  \\n\\n5.5.2 The privacy and psychological well-being of people participating in observational research and people participating in research activities in which a researcher may actually be acting as a fellow  \\n\\nparticipant, for example as part of a wider group, must be respected. In such group based, participatory research activities the usual effort should be made to ensure that the group leader(s), or others in positions of responsibility, as well as other individuals of a group, are made aware that they participate in their activities with research purposes. If this \"open strategy\" is not pursued, the researcher must be able to make an explicit and convincing case why this was not done.  \\n\\n5.5.3 It is recognized that in certain types of observational research or organizational settings it may be more difficult to explain to people participating their right to withdraw at any stage. However, in such types of research, researchers are expected to make a reasonable attempt to do so.  \\n\\n#### 5.6 Research Involving Deception  \\n\\n5.6.1 In certain research disciplines (e.g. psychology), to ensure the viability of a piece of research, it is sometimes necessary to withhold information on the true objectives of the research from the people participating in it. In such types of research it is impossible to obtain informed consent from the participants. Wherever possible such research should be avoided and the Ethical Research Committee will pay particular attention to research involving deception. Where deception or the misleading of participants is considered necessary, the central principle to consider when deciding the ethical soundness of deception is the anticipated reaction of the participant once debriefed. If it is likely that the participant will be angry, or show unease once debriefed the research is likely to be deemed unacceptable.  \\n\\n5.6.2 However, when such research, requiring consent but not informed consent from participants, is judged to be necessary for the results of the research to be valid, researchers must exercise particular caution. In such circumstances the lead researcher has a special responsibility to: (i) Justify that alternative procedures to avoid the withholding of information or deliberate deception are not available and, if available, are not feasible for the research; (ii) Justify why the withholding of information, or an element of concealment or deception, is integral to the viability of the research.  \\n\\n#### 5.7 Research Involving Personal Data  \\n\\nIn all cases where personal data is collected, recorded, used, or managed in any other way during research, the relevant privacy rules of CEU’s Data Protection Policy shall be followed, as applicable.  ',\n",
       " 'Confidentiality, Anonymity and Privacy  \\n\\n8.1 The collection, storage, disclosure and use of personal data by researchers must comply with all legislation relating to data protection and arrangements must be put in place by researchers to carefully protect the confidentiality of participants and their data. Details that would allow individuals to be identified must not be published or made available to anybody not involved in the research unless explicit consent is given by the individuals concerned.  \\n\\n8.2 Before consent is obtained, researchers must inform prospective participants of:   \\n(i) Risks regarding the confidentiality of personal data and data revealed during research when the information is gathered in the presence of other participants (e.g. focus groups);   \\n(ii) Any potential risks that might mean that the confidentiality or anonymity of personal data may not be guaranteed;   \\n(iii) Which individuals and organizations, if any, will be permitted access to personal data, and under what circumstances such access will be granted;   \\n(iv) The purpose for which personal information provided is to be used (e.g. if video material might be used for teaching purposes).  \\n\\n8.3 If it is necessary, in undertaking research, to identify participants explicitly, then the researchers must explain why this is the case and how confidentiality will be protected. Researchers must be aware of the risks to anonymity, confidentiality and privacy posed by all kinds of personal information storage and processing which directly identify a person (e.g. audio and videotapes, electronic and paper-based files, e-mail records). 3 Measures to prevent accidental breaches of confidentiality must be taken, and in cases where confidentiality is threatened, relevant records should be destroyed. Provisions for data security at the end of a project must be made.  \\n\\n8.4 Guarantees of confidentiality and anonymity given to research participants must be honored, unless there are clear and overriding reasons to inform appropriate third parties (e.g. cases of child abuse, where an uninvolved 3rd party may be at risk through the participant’s actions or where a possibility of the participant’s self-harm is revealed during the research). All participants have the right to access personal information, whether or not it is confidential, that relates to them, and to be provided with a copy of the information on request (all participants have to be made aware of the process and researcher(s) responsible for providing the information). People should have the right, following the completion of their period of involvement in the research and following discussions with the researcher, to withdraw their consent and to require that their own data be destroyed, if practicable and unless the withdrawal jeopardizes the research at its final stages (see also: 5.1.2).  ',\n",
       " 'Identification of ethical research issues and the need for a review  \\n\\n(a) The Checklist on Ethical Issues in Research is the basic instrument in identifying ethical issues. It is strongly advised that researchers use the Checklist as a guide for the research already in its designing/planning stage, so that possible violations of Ethical Research Policy and Ethical Research Guidelines are avoided.  \\n\\n(b) Every researcher at CEU should, before signing a contract with CEU, receive all the relevant documents relating to ethical issues in research (Ethical Research Policy, Ethical Research Guidelines, Operational Rules of the ERC, the Checklist on Ethical Issues in Research). All contracts signed with CEU should contain a clause: “I have received all the relevant documents related to the ethical issues in research and will abide by the rules laid down in these documents”.  \\n\\n#### 4.1 Master’s/PhD Dissertations  \\n\\n(a) Identification of ethical research issues in Master’s thesis/PhD dissertation projects is the responsibility of the student and his/her supervisor(s).  \\n\\nThe following are applicable only if any ethical research issue is identified in the thesis/: (b) Unless there is another well-established disciplinary practice of addressing ethical issues in research, students and supervisors are advised to consult and use the Checklist on Ethical Issues in Research as a basis of identifying and addressing ethical issues.  \\n\\n(c) If there are research ethics issues involved in the student’s work, supervisors should make sure that the student receives some form of training in this field. The training could be a component of research or methods courses which are part of the curriculum.  Supervisors or Academic Unit Heads may wish to ask students to complete the online ethical research training module described in Point 2 in lieu of ethical research training in the Unit.  .  \\n\\n(d) Departments/Programs may decide to make the submission and discussion of a completed Checklist a Prospectus Seminar requirement for thesis/dissertations/research proposals in which ethical issues were identified. It is within the authority of Departmental/Programs’ authorities to make the Checklist on Ethical Issues in Research an integral part of the dissertation.  \\n\\n(e) Departmental/Program Committees may conduct random checks of dissertations and student work in progress with regards to the identification of ethical issues and reviews with regards to the compliance with Ethical Research Guidelines.  \\n\\n#### 4.2 Research conducted by academic staff  \\n\\n(a) Identification of ethical research issues in research projects is the responsibility of the principal researcher(s) of the project. If potential issues are identified, the Checklist on Ethical Issues in Research should be completed and filed so that it can be produced upon request by the ERC. If there are no ethical issues, there is no need to fill in the Checklist.  \\n\\n(b) Researchers may request consultations with other persons/bodies at CEU on ethical research issues in the order indicated in ‘Research by Academic Staff Members’ of section 3.2 above  \\n\\n(c) The ERC may conduct random ethical reviews of research projects. In those cases, the principal investigator(s) should produce the Checklist and all other relevant material for review as required. The specialised Committees appointed can also conduct random reviews in their field.  \\n\\n(d) All research projects by the CEU academic staff which receive either external funding or targeted funding from CEU should file a completed Checklist with the ACRO if ethical issues are identified in the project. In accordance with Point (c) above, the ERC may conduct random checks on these projects.  \\n\\n(e) If a research proposal fails to meet ethical standards required, the funding of the project may be refused or suspended.

       " 'Review process  \\n\\n(a) For review purposes, ERC maintains a list of potential reviewers, updated at the beginning of every academic year, both from among CEU academic staff members and academics not affiliated with CEU, with expertise relevant for determining issues in research ethics.  \\n\\n(b) Researchers applying for the ethical research review by ERC should submit the research proposal, the Checklist on Ethical Issues in Research, with the section on requesting a review filled in as appropriate, to the Chair of the ERC at least two months before the commencement of the research. The results of the review should be communicated to the researcher(s) in time for the start of the research.  \\n\\n(c) The Chair of the ERC will ask a member of the Committee to recommend reviewers for the proposal. The Committee member proposes two persons from the list of reviewers and/or from among the members of the ERC to serve as reviewers. The reviewers are asked to check the compliance of the research project with ethical standards.  \\n\\n(d) The review reports are submitted to the Chair of the ERC, and if amendments are proposed by the reviewers, these are conveyed to the applicant. Research proposals can be amended twice, and if necessary, reviewers are asked to check if amendments sufficiently address the concerns raised.  \\n\\n(e) The Chair of the ERC makes a decision about the acceptance or refusal of proposals, taking into account the reviewers’ opinion and the compliance of the applicants with suggestions to amend the project.  \\n\\n(f) If continued supervision of the project is needed then, when possible, one of the reviewers is appointed and when not, the Chair of the ERC appoints a supervisor from the list of potential reviewers.  \\n\\n(g) In the case that an ethical research review is carried out by another Committee, to which such responsibilities had been delegated by the ERC in line with Point 10 of the Ethical Research Policy, the researchers have a responsibility to notify the Chair of the ERC and file the review results with ACRO.  \\n\\n## Annex 3 to the Ethical Research Policy  \\n\\n### Checklist on Ethical Issues in Research  \\n\\nThis Checklist is intended as a guide for CEU students/researchers in planning, designing and carrying out research, and for applying approval to the Ethical Research Committee.

       " '# Edinburgh Napier University Research Data Management Policy  \\n\\n## Introduction/Rationale  \\n\\nEdinburgh Napier University (the University) is committed to delivering excellent research and, as research data is at the very core of evidencing research quality and integrity, it is vital that robust research data management,  open data policies and procedures are in place to ensure that research conducted by, and under the auspices of, Edinburgh Napier University meets the highest standards to comply with legislative, regulatory, audit, funding body, partner (stakeholder) and internal requirements.  \\n\\nThis policy underlines the University’s commitment to the Universities UK Concordats on open research data and research integrity, by highlighting the importance of the management of research data to good governance and best practice.  \\n\\nFurther to this, in line with the UK and Scottish Government’ research funders (such as UK Research and Innovation, Horizon Europe and UK research charities) commitment to open data and to ensuring that the outputs from research are freely accessible, the University requires research data to be managed efficiently and effectively to facilitate such use, sharing and publication as appropriate to ensure the maximum benefit is derived from any research undertaken under its auspices.  \\n\\n# Scope of Policy  \\n\\nThis policy applies to all researchers and support staff employed to conduct research and innovation activities under the auspices of the University and to all research data regardless of how it is funded. It includes research undertaken by research postgraduate students.  \\n\\nThis policy covers all data, information and records created, received, and maintained during research activities, in any format whether physical and electronic. These might be quantitative information or qualitative statements collected by researchers in the course of their work by experimentation, observation, modelling, interview or other methods, or information derived from existing evidence. Data may be raw or primary (e.g. direct from measurement or collection) or derived from primary data for subsequent analysis or interpretation (e.g. cleaned up or as an extract from a larger data set) or derived from existing sources where the rights may be held by others.  \\n\\nThey may include statistics, instrument measurements, collections of digital images, sound or video recordings, transcripts of interviews, survey data and fieldwork observations with appropriate annotations, an interpretation, an artwork, archives, found objects, published texts or manuscripts, simulation data, models & software, slides, physical artefacts, specimens, samples, questionnaires, sketches, diaries, lab notebooks, social media data, etc.  \\n\\n## Policy Aims and Objectives  \\n\\n• To ensure that all colleagues dealing with research data recognise their responsibilities and the obligations placed on them and the University by stakeholders;  \\n\\n• To promote open access to research data to support collaboration;  \\n\\n• To ensure that the University fully complies with the requirements of specific funding bodies.  \\n\\n## Policy Statement  \\n\\nAll research data created during research and innovation activities, whether internally, unfunded, or externally funded, must be created, received, and maintained in accordance with associated policies and procedures and as defined in ENU’s Responsibilities guidelines.  \\n\\nA Research Data Management plan (DMP) or a declaration stating no data will be generated must be submitted as part of the project proposal for ALL research projects. The DMP must adhere to the requirements of the University using templates and guidance provided by the University, whether or not required by external funding bodies. Where specifically required by funding bodies, the Research Data Management Plan must meet the requirements of both the University and funding bodies.  \\n\\nIntellectual property, copyright and/or rights to re-use/share the data remain with the University (as per the Intellectual Property policy) unless otherwise dictated by the funding body and agreed by the University.  \\n\\nIf researchers/employees leave the University, data and records relating to any research conducted under the auspices of the University remain the property of the University. Remaining data files should be assigned a data custodian responsible for the management or the data.  \\n\\nWhere the Principal Investigator and the grant transfer to another institution during a project, the University will normally accord the rights for the data and records generated up to that time to transfer as an integral part of the research but will retain a copy as part of its own research record.  \\n\\nNew employees bringing with them existing research contracts are required to comply with the University’s policy on research data and records from the commencement of their employment.  \\n\\nEdinburgh Napier University Research Data Management Policy April 2015, Revision March 2022  \\n\\n## Responsibilities  \\n\\nThe most senior Edinburgh Napier University researcher associated with a research project is the Principal Investigator, unless specified otherwise on the funding application, for that project and is ultimately responsible for research data management and planning including making research data open.  \\n\\nIn the case of a PhD project, the Director of Studies is responsible. It is their duty to ensure that all members of the research team with access to the research data adhere to good research data management practice.  \\n\\nIn the case of collaborative projects, if the Principal Investigator is based elsewhere, the lead researcher at Edinburgh Napier University must take responsibility for all data generated here.  \\n\\nThroughout the lifecycle of the research data, researchers and support staff involved in the management of the data must ensure that the following principles are adhered to in order to achieve the objective of the capture and maintenance of authentic, reliable, open and re-useable data:  ',\n",
       " 'Ensure exclusive rights to re-use or publish research data are not handed over to commercial publishers or agents without retaining the rights to make the data openly available for re-use unless this is a condition of funding.  \\n\\n### Principal Investigators (PIs)  \\n\\nPIs have primary responsibility for:  \\n\\n• Ensuring that a robust DMP plan is in place, prior to the start of the project (ideally at project planning/application stage) which is implemented and maintained throughout the course of the research project.  \\n\\n• Maintaining appropriate metadata and documentation throughout the lifecycle of the data as prescribed by the University.  \\n\\n• Ensuring staff designated with research data management duties have clearly defined and documented responsibilities which adhere to university guidance. • Ensuring that they and staff with designated data management responsibilities adhere to the requirements for capturing and maintaining research data. • Ultimate responsibility to ensure effective data curation throughout the lifecycle of the research data.  \\n\\n### Deans of Schools  \\n\\n• Have overall responsibility for the management of research data generated by their School’s research activities; • Responsibility for appointing a replacement should the Principal Investigator leave the University before their duties relating to data management have been discharged;  \\n\\n## The University  \\n\\nEdinburgh Napier University recognises its obligations to:  \\n\\n• Ensure that appropriate training, support and guidance is available to enable   \\nresearchers to comply with this policy;   \\n• Establish a register of research records as per the University guidance;   \\n• Ensure that the necessary central support is available to researchers to facilitate consistent, compliant and best practice research data management; Central support will be provided across Research Innovation and Enterprise, Library Services and IT and Governance Services;   \\n• Provide an institutional repository and appropriate services for the management of research data which will facilitate and enable the capture, storage, maintenance, use, re-use/ sharing/ publication and continuity of the data.   \\n• Maximise the impact and public benefit of research by enabling publication of research data and its metadata via appropriate data repositories and data centres.   \\n• Ensure that this Policy is communicated through publication, promotion, induction and review processes.  \\n\\n## Implementation, Compliance and Monitoring  \\n\\nThe University will monitor compliance with the DMP policy on an ongoing basis by random sampling. The University may take internal disciplinary action in the event of a breach of this Policy or of the associated legislation and regulation.  \\n\\n## Links  \\n\\n• Research Data Management   \\n• Data Protection Policy and Code of Practice   \\n• Information Security Policy   \\n• Records Management Policy   \\nAccess to Information Policy   \\nIntellectual Property policy  \\n\\n# Contact  \\n\\nJob Title: Head of Research Governance Team: Research, Innovation and Enterprise Contact details: rdm@napier.ac.uk  \\n\\nV2.0  \\n\\nVersion control:   \\n\\n\\n section change \\nV2.0 Introduction Added references to concordat on open data, updated RCUK to UK Research and Innovation, added other funders - Horizon Europe and UK research charities \\nV2.0 Scope Added more details on types of research data as defined in sector documents \\nV2.0 Policy statement Minor changes to wording, addition of link to IP policy \\nV2.0 Responsibilities summary Some working and formatting changes \\nV2.0 Responsibilities point 1 Added examples and links related to legal responsibilities \\nV2.0 Responsibilities point 2, 4 Added links to university guidance \\nV2.0 Responsibilities points 5-14 Reordered and added links.

       " 'Art. 3   Definitions  \\n\\n1 Research Data are all data that the relevant scientific community accepts as necessary for validating research findings (based on Article 10 of the Integrity Guidelines).14  \\n\\n2 Metadata are data that provide information about data.  \\n\\n3 Programming Code signifies machine-readable instructions created in the context of a research project, for example, to analyse Research Data, to reproduce research findings from a given data set or to perform experiments.  \\n\\n4 FAIR Principles are internationally recognised guidelines to improve the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse of digital assets. The principles emphasise machine-actionability (for details see Annex A).15  \\n\\n5 Open Research Data (ORD) are Research Data that are FAIR and, in addition, publicly available, accessible and reusable at no cost. These guidelines understand ORD as an ideal to be strived for that might not be achievable in all cases (for justified exceptions see Art. 6.3).  \\n\\n6 Research Data Management (hereinafter “RDM”) is the systematic, transparent, and adequate handling of data across the complete data lifecycle using recognised services and infrastructures. Research Data Management planning includes measures to be undertaken at every step of the data lifecycle16 to ensure transparency and reproducibility of research. Data management planning starts from the creation and/or collection of data, followed by their analysis, publication, storage, sharing, preservation and reuse. Together, all these steps are continuously documented in a Data Management Plan (hereinafter “DMP”). In addition, RDM can support fulfilling the FAIR Principles by distinguishing data of temporary or permanent relevance according to accepted Community Standards and thus providing a reliable basis for informed decisions on data deletion, temporary retention (usually a minimum of 10 years), or unlimited preservation.  \\n\\n7 Community Standards are understood as both explicit, formalised standards and informal, but well established and widely accepted best practices within a community. A community can, e.g. comprise researchers sharing an interest in the same object of research or working with the same methods. Common Community Standards address, e.g. identification, citation and reporting of Research Data and Metadata. They reflect a community’s consensus, at a certain point in time, on how reproducible and reusable research should be implemented.  \\n\\n8 Data Availability Statements provide a statement about where data necessary for validating the research findings reported in a result publication can be found — including, where applicable, hyperlinks to publicly archived additional datasets analysed or generated during the research activity.  \\n\\n9 Research Group Leaders are professors or heads of platforms and scientific facilities who hold budget and the overall responsibility for a research group, platform, or facility.',\n",
       " \"Regulations  \\n\\nStorage of data packages  \\n\\nResearch data must be managed in accordance with the applicable university requirements relating to information security, privacy protection and transparency.   \\nDuring the research project, data must be stored in an environment with an access restrictions option and back-up facilities. The standard environment provided by the faculty for this purpose is YODA. Other options are the O: drive or SURFdrive. Researchers can consult the Research Data Management Support website to identify a suitable storage environment.5 Researchers may propose using a different environment and should first submit a proposal to the faculty data manager.   \\nIf the data contain personal data, the use of YODA as a storage environment is obligatory. It is possible to derogate from this obligation but only with the permission of the Information Security Officer. Local storage is temporarily permitted, for example, because data have been recorded on a peripheral device. However, the data must be encrypted for local storage, and transferred to YODA as soon as possible and destroyed locally. Further guidelines for the storage of data containing personal data follow below.  \\n\\nHandling data containing personal data  \\n\\nLegal requirements laid down in the GDPR apply to the processing of personal data. Researchers attached to the Faculty of Humanities must therefore process personal data in accordance with the requirements laid down in the GDPR, and in accordance with the requirements laid down by Utrecht University and the Faculty of Humanities. In general, this means that6:  \\n\\no Before creating a data collection, the researcher must carry out data classification and a DPIA, supported by the faculty data manager or otherwise.7   \\no Limit: only the personal data required for the research are collected. If, prior to the research, the purpose for which personal data are used to answer a research question is not clear, those personal data should not be collected.   \\no Separate: directly identifiable personal data must be separated from the other data and replaced by pseudo codes as soon as possible. Files in which the directly identifiable personal data and the corresponding pseudo codes are recorded, the ‘key files’, must be separated from the other research data.   \\no Inform: as far as is possible, the persons concerned will be informed of the research and requested to grant permission for use of their data.   \\no Provide control: as far as is possible and/or reasonable, research subjects will be given the opportunity to inspect their data, correct their data or withdraw from the research.   \\no Render unidentifiable: data containing personal data are archived only after anonymisation so that the data cannot be directly traced back to individuals. Anonymisation can be carried out using aggregations, or pseudo codes to replace the personal data.   \\no Hide: data containing personal data must be stored in locations with encryption.   \\no The storage or transmission of such data outside the European Economic Area is not permitted.   \\no Data containing personal data may only be exchanged with third parties provided that explicit agreements (transfer or processing agreements)8 have been concluded for that purpose. As soon as (a version of) the data form the basis for a scientific claim expressed in a scientific publication, for instance, the data concerned are packaged together in a data package, archived and published.   \\nThe data package contains, to the extent possible, all the necessary data, descriptions, scripts and images in order to: o reproduce the research results;   \\no retrieve the origin of the data;   \\no understand the collection method;   \\no identify the staff involved in creating the data package;   \\no understand the objective of the research;   \\no know the conditions for reusing the data;   \\no know the minimum storage duration.  \\n\\nDepending on the archive, repository or storage environment selected, the researcher can include most of the above information in the standard metadata forms currently available. All the information the researcher is unable to include in the metadata forms should be recorded in a text file that is added to the data package.  \\n\\nAs stated earlier, YODA is the faculty's preferred digital archive and publication platform.9 Other data archives, repositories or storage environments may be used. Researchers should consult the Research Data Management Support website to identify a suitable archive environment. Researchers may propose using a different environment and should first submit a proposal to the faculty data manager.   \\nIn principle, data must be anonymised before being archived. Data that cannot be anonymised are archived and published as a data package referenced as ‘Closed Access’. Closed Access data packages can only be accessed by the data owners.   \\nData to which rights apply, such as copyrights, and therefore cannot be archived for a prolonged period or included in the publication of a data package, must be deleted prior to archiving.   \\nData packages are made available as Open Access data to the public, provided that there are no compelling reasons for providing the data under Restricted Access or Closed Access. The Faculty of Humanities’ preferred user licence is Creative Commons Attribution/Share Alike 4.0.10 Where possible, the original (primary/rough) data must be archived, together with the scripts used to transform and analyse the data.   \\nFor maintenance purposes and to ensure long-term accessibility, data files should be archived in ‘sustainable’ file formats, where possible. The Faculty of Humanities uses the DANS list for this purpose.11   \\nAll individuals whose names are recorded in the data package are also identified by a persistent identifier in addition to their first and surname. The Faculty of Humanities uses ORCID as the identifier for individuals12.   \\nIn principle, data are archived for a period (the retention period) of at least ten years in a data package.   \\nIf data have been archived in YODA, the faculty independently decides at the end of the retention period whether the data should be archived for a longer period and at which location.   \\nAfter the data have been archived in a data package, the metadata of the package are published (in other words the metadata are distributed) and the data package is assigned a unique identifier. This occurs automatically in most repositories at the time of archiving. The Faculty of Humanities uses DOI as the persistent identifier for data packages.13\",\n",
       " '4.2\\t Publishing, Licensing, Storing, and Archiving Research Data  \\n\\nMachine-readable, processable research data can be deposited, referenced, and made accessible in different repositories. Depending on the project, researchers might choose a domain-specific repository, a subject-specific repository, or Freie Universität’s own institutional repository, “Refubium.”17  \\n\\nWhere intellectual property or data protection legislation or the principles of ethical research require restricting access to research data, Freie Universität offers technical archiving solutions.\\u200918 If there are reasons why research-relevant data are not to be stored, this should be documented in accordance with the recommendations on good scientific practice. If the research data are archived but not published, Freie Universität recommends that the metadata are deposited in Refubium to ensure the maximum visibility and long-term citability of research outcomes.  \\n\\nThe University Library assists members of the university in documenting and cataloguing their data for publication\\u200919 and in using sustainable and/or open standard formats\\u200920.  \\n\\nIf usage or publication rights are to be transferred, use of the data for academic purposes should be guaranteed on a perpetual basis. Freie Universität Berlin therefore recommends granting open licenses for use when data (including their metadata) are published, e.g., CC0 or CC BY\\u200921 for data, GNU General Public License\\u200922 or MIT License\\u200923 for source code. Data should be assigned persistent identifiers, e.g., Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs).  \\n\\nThe University Library offers this service free of charge.\\u200924 For the citation and/or referencing of data\\u200925 and software\\u200926, researchers should refer to established standards.  \\n\\nResearch data must be stored and made accessible for as long as required and possible according to the recommendations and rules of research funders within the framework of statutory and legal provisions (e.g., the EU regulations on personal data [GDPR], intellectual property law). The minimum time for which research data should be stored is usually ten years from the date of publication of the data or the relevant work and/or the end of the project.\\u200927 Freie Universität’s institutional storage systems (ZEDAT; Refubium) ensure that data are stored for at least this long.  \\n\\nIf research data are to be deleted from the institutional storage systems, then this must be done in agreement with the relevant researchers as well as the infrastructure providers (i.e., the University Library and ZEDAT) following the expiry of the required archiving period and in compliance with all legal and ethical requirements. The decision as to whether to retain or delete the data should take into account the interests and contractual obligations of external funders and/or other stakeholders, such as cooperation partners, participating research institutions, etc.',\n",

       " 'III. Final phase: after completion of the research project  \\n\\nAccording to good scientific practice, research data must be archived and made available by the end of a project. In particular, public access has become a necessity in recent years in order to facilitate the traceability of research results as well as subsequent reuse of the data. It is recommended to publish research data following the principle \"as open as possible, as restricted as necessary\".  \\n\\nThere are various ways to publish research data. In addition to domain-agnostic repositories, a large number of discipline-specific repositories exist. To find a suitable repository for your research data, the portal re3data.org 6  provides extensive search and filter capabilities. In addition, there are special data journals for publishing research data. In some disciplines it is common practice to publish data as a supplement to the respective article. However, this form of data publication has the disadvantage that the data can only be found via the article and does not form an independent, citable publication object  \\n\\nWhen selecting a publication method, the following criteria should be taken into account: long-term availability (at least 10 years), allocation of persistent identifiers (e.g. DOI, URN), licensing and usage terms of the data, visibility and cost.  \\n\\nAs a member of the FSU, you may publish and archive research data with the Digital Library of Thuringia (DBT)7.  \\n\\nIf you published research data with an external repository, you are requested to register this publication with the Digital Library Thuringia, too.  \\n\\nIndividual websites (e.g. of projects, departments, employees) are generally not suitable for the publication of research data. The long-term availability of such websites is often not guaranteed and non-ambiguous identification (keyword: PID) and cross-referencing is limited.  \\n\\nWhen selecting the data to be published, the DFG (2015) recommends, \"Data should be made accessible at a stage of processing that allows it to be usefully reused by third parties (raw data or structured data).\" In particular, data that served as the foundation of a scientific article should be made public.  \\n\\nAs with scientific articles, research data should also receive a unique, persistent identifier (PID). A PID (e.g. DOI, URN) is typically provided by the repository or data journal at the time of publication. In order to mandate usage and exploitation rights of your research data, data should always be published with a corresponding license. The selected license should allow at least open access for scientific purposes. Specific requirements of the funding organisation or repositories may apply and need to be considered. Suitable data licenses are available from Open Data Commons8 or the Creative Commons9. In general, research data should be published as soon as possible. However, there may be reasons to publish research data with an embargo period. In this case, the data is submitted to the repository for archiving, but it is only accessible after the end of the embargo period. The researchers who are responsible for the data determine the length of the embargo period, unless otherwise requested by the policies and guidelines of funding organisations or the repositories. Embargo periods should not exceed 1-2 years after the end of the project.  \\n\\nVorstehende Handlungsempfehlung wurde am 20.

       " '1. Terminology  \\n\\nResearcher: refers to any natural person who is conducting scholarly and/or academic research and is registered at Hasselt University, both paid and unpaid, and including doctoral students.  \\n\\nStudent: refers to any student who is attending a bachelor or master programme, a preparatory or bridging course, an advanced master, a teacher training or postgraduate certificate programme, an internship, an exchange study programme or credit contract at Hasselt University.  \\n\\nHierarchical responsible: depends on the statute of the researcher and his/her position within the research and organizational structure of Hasselt University. The hierarchy can be described as follows:  \\n\\nAcademic staff members (AAP, BAP [PhD], ZAP) < PI research group / director research institute < Dean < Vice-Rector Research < Rector   \\nAdministrative and technical staff members (ATP) < Coordinator unit < Director < ViceRector or Administrator < Rector   \\nStudent < (co-)Supervisor < PI research group / director research institute < Dean < ViceRector Research < Rector  \\n\\nResearch data: refers to all data and objects – whatever their form or method – that are generated, collected or used in the context of any research project. As a result, this broad definition includes a wide array of types and formats of data, ranging from raw data to processed and even published data. It may refer to both digital and physical data, and to data generated by the researcher himself /herself (primary data) as well as to data obtained from third parties (secondary data).  \\n\\nExamples may include, but are not limited to: notes, surveys, figures, objects, audio-visual files, spreadsheets, databases, statistical data, geographical data, research software, simulations, samples (including biological material, personal data, patient data, etc.).  \\n\\nMetadata: refers to data that describe the characteristics of the actual research data as to be able to identify and retrieve the latter more efficiently, that reflect the structure and composition of the research data and that facilitate the management of research data.  \\n\\nFor example, the title of a dataset, the names and affiliations of the researchers involved, a persistent identifier, version number, the relationship with an existing research project or scholarly publication, the date of creation, the file format, the access rights, etc.  \\n\\nHigh-quality research data: research data are deemed to be high-quality, when they are accurate, complete, authentic, reliable, understandable, identifiable, documented, findable, accessible, securely stored and secured.  \\n\\nAnonymous (anonymized) research data: refers to research data that don’t relate to an identified or identifiable natural person or to personal data rendered anonymous in such a manner that the data subject is not or no longer identifiable.  \\n\\nPseudonymous (pseudonymized) research data: refers to personal data that are processed in such a manner that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organizational measures to ensure that the personal data are not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person.  \\n\\nPersonal data: refers to any information relating to an identified or (in)directly identifiable natural person. Examples include, without being limited to: name, address, telephone number, chassis number, email address, IP address, age, gender, origin, image, way of life, personal opinions, etc. Each researcher collecting and/or processing personal data, must comply with the regulations concerning the protection of personal data.  \\n\\nSpecial categories of personal data: refers to particular personal data that are more sensitive by nature. Examples include, without being limited to: personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health (including medical information), data concerning a natural person’s sex life or sexual orientation, and data relating to criminal convictions and offences.  \\n\\nRecord of processing activities: each controller and, where applicable, the controller’s representative, shall maintain a record of processing activities under its responsibility. Art. 30 GDPR lays down the information that this record should contain.  \\n\\nData minimization: refers to the fact that personal data shall be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed. As a result, researchers should, as far as possible, only process personal data that are necessary for their specified research purposes.  \\n\\nData Protection Officer (DPO): (s)he is a staff member of Hasselt University and is designated to supervise the processing of personal data on behalf of Hasselt University. The Data Protection Officer (DPO) monitors implementation of and compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation within Hasselt University.  \\n\\nConfidential research data: refers to research data that need to be treated confidentially on account of a third party (internal/external) agreement.  \\n\\nInventions: refers to research results, as described in article IV.48.§1 of the Codex Hoger Onderwijs. That is to say potentially patentable findings, breeding products, designs and models, topographies of solid-state products, computer programmes and databases that could be used for commercial purposes when being applied in industry or agriculture.  \\n\\nOpen data: refers to research data that can be freely (re)used and shared by anyone, subject to the requirements of attribution and share-alike.  \\n\\nStorage: refers to the recording of research data during the research (project).  \\n\\nPreservation: refers to the recording of research data after the end of the research (project). Longterm preservation, in addition, refers to the recording of research data beyond a certain period (e.g. five years) after the end of a research (project).',\n",
       " '3. PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES  \\n\\n3.1 Principal Investigators have overall responsibility for the effective management of research data generated within or obtained for their research, including by their research groups. The Library and ICT will provide training, guidance and services to support PIs in the following roles and responsibilities.  \\n\\n3.2 Principal Investigators will provide a data management plan (DMP) for all research grant and contract proposals from the date mandated by the funder where applicable, and in any case by 1st January 2016. This should be in the DMP format provided by the funder if one has been defined, and otherwise the College standard format2 should be used. See 5.1 and 5.2 for details of the support provided by the Library for this task.  \\n\\n3.3 During the course of a research project, the PI must ensure their own and their group’s data (and use reasonable endeavours to ensure their collaborators’ research data) are stored and described in ways that will minimise the risk of loss and maximise the likelihood of future discoverability and re-use.  \\n\\n3.3.1 Minimum standards of data safety to be followed are published by ICT3.  \\n\\n3.3.2 ICT will provide shared network storage that complies with these standards (see 6.1).  \\n\\n3.3.3 Research data are to be accompanied by adequate metadata and/or documentation to facilitate its identification and re-use. See 5.1 and 5.6 for details of the support provided by the Library for this task.  \\n\\nPrincipal Investigators are responsible for identifying and preserving all their research data (whether shareable or not) that would be required to validate published research findings in the future.  \\n\\nPrincipal Investigators are responsible for determining what their shareable research data comprises in view of the considerations in 3.6. The minimum requirement is to share all relevant data to support and underpin published findings including e-theses.  Any funder requirements must also be met.  \\n\\n.6 Principal Investigators must deposit their shareable research data in a publicly-available repository of their choosing no later than the time of publication of the findings.  Where the funder requires deposit earlier, the timeframes specified by the funder take precedence.  Where the funder requires the data to be deposited in a different repository, the funder’s requirements must also be followed although deposit in multiple repositories is acceptable.  \\n\\n3.6.1 Publication – the PI’s entitlement to be the first to publish based on data they have generated must be preserved.  If the PI will not be able to publish their findings by the funder’s deadline for data sharing, the PI should request an extension of the embargo period from the funder.   \\n3.6.2 Copyright – the PI will not share any data that would infringe any right of title or copyright. Where third party research data are used, access conditions should be sought and followed and the source of that data will be acknowledged where required.',\n",
       " 'RESEARCH DATA MANAGEMENT POLICY  \\n\\n3.6.3 Licences – the PI is entitled to select the licence under which they publish their data provided the chosen licence permits sharing and re-use in accordance with the appropriate funder’s terms and conditions (if any exist) and this policy.  \\n\\n3.6.3 Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) – the PI will not share any data that would infringe the IPR of others.  \\n\\n3.6.4 Commercial Interests – the PI is entitled to delay sharing of their data where early release may harm commercialisation opportunities arising from their research until appropriate protection is in place.  \\n\\n3.6.5 Privacy – the PI will take all appropriate steps to ensure the anonymity of any personal data prior to sharing.  For patient data, further requirements are detailed in “Data Protection Policy – Code of Practice 2: Handling of Patient Data”4 and must be met.  \\n\\n3.6.6 Ethical Concerns – the PI should bear in mind potential ethical considerations in making the decision to share their data.  \\n\\n3.6.7 Cost Effectiveness – where computer-generated data may be reliably recreated at a cost less than that of storing raw output data, then the inputs and human-readable outputs of the relevant programme may be stored instead along with a reference to or copy of the software version used.  \\n\\n3.6.8 Legal Safeguards – where data are shared with restrictions, e.g. if they identify human subjects, they would normally be stored in repositories located in the EU to prevent their full disclosure via Freedom of Information and Data Protection safeguards.  See 5.6 for details of the support provided by the Library for this task.  \\n\\n3.7 If software is developed as part of a research project, Principal Investigators must archive the particular version of the software used to generate or analyse the data in a repository and inform the Library of its location, taking account of the points raised in 3.5 above. Principal Investigators are encouraged to follow the Sustainability and Preservation Framework of the Software Sustainability Institute.5.  \\n\\nPrincipal Investigators will inform the Library of the location of their shared research data and specified metadata including the Digital Object Identifier (DOI) for that data package at the time of deposit.  \\n\\nPrincipal Investigators will ensure that all journal articles include a means to obtain the supporting data by referencing the appropriate DOI.  \\n\\n3.10 Appropriate funding for RDM should be requested at application stage where this is an eligible cost item allowed by the funder [TBC based on most effective means of covering these costs under FEC methodology].  \\n\\n.11 Principal Investigators will ensure that shareable research data are made publicly available for 10 years after publication or for the minimum period required by the funder if longer than 10 years.  \\n\\n3.12 If the PI leaves Imperial College or circumstances (such as death, incapacitation or leaving academia) mean the PI is no longer able to fulfil their responsibilities then:  \\n\\n3.12.1 If there is an Imperial College Co-Investigator, they inherit the responsibilities of the PI;  \\n\\n3.12.2 Otherwise, if the PI and the award move to another institution, the responsibilities follow the PI;  \\n\\n3.12.3 Otherwise, whom so ever is appointed by the department to complete any of the PI’s requirements for the research project will become the PI from an Imperial College perspective and as such inherit the responsibilities outlined in this section.',\n",
       " '3. Definitions  \\n\\nResearch data: the term ‘research data’ refers to all forms of information, commonly accepted in the academic community, that is collected, observed, generated, or created as necessary to validate research findings and conclusions. Examples include geospatial and remote sensing data, statistics, field and laboratory measurements, experimental and observational data, surveys, interviews, video and audio recordings, photos and images, analysis scripts, etc. (Kruse & Thestrup, 2018). Research data also include secondary documents such as policy reports and data obtained from literature review. Research data do not include the following materials: drafts of academic papers, plans for future research, peer reviews, or communication with colleagues.  \\n\\nResearch project: In this policy, a research project refers to a detailed study of a subject aimed to solve specific research questions or objectives. It involves the collection, analysis, and interpretation of data in order to discover new facts or develop new concepts, generate new findings, and instigate progress. Research projects explicitly include research carried out by master students and academic researchers (PhD candidates, postdoctoral fellows, researchers and senior academic staff, i.e. assistant professors, associate professors, and full professors).  \\n\\nData management plan (DMP): A DMP is a formal document that describes all data that are to be used in the project, the documentation and organisation of data, data storage during the research process, preservation of data after the project is completed, and finally, the future availability of data for sharing and re-use. The DMP should also provide information on the planned measures to safeguard and protect sensitive data such as personal data (Berez-Kroeker et al., 2022).  \\n\\nMetadata: the term ‘metadata’ refers to structured information about data. Such information makes it easier to understand, discover, use, or manage data. It includes information such as the description of said data, their origin, temporal coverage, geographic location, creator, access conditions, and other descriptive elements (Riley, 2017).  \\n\\nPersonal data: In accordance with GDPR, the term ‘personal data’ refers to any information that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person, such as a name, an identification number, a geographical location, an online identifier, or one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person (European Union, 2016).  \\n\\nClassified data: the term ‘classified data’ refers to data that have been classified to a certain level of sensitivity, considering properties such as availability, integrity, and confidentiality, in order to decide the related level of security and protection measures.',\n",
       " \"5.5 Data Preservation  \\n\\nData preservation refers to the long-time storage of research data to enable the verification and reproduction of research and the re-use of data. Publishing and archiving data are the two most practical ways to preserve data after research.  \\n\\nDigital research data needed for verification and reproduction (at least those underlying all types of academic publications, such as journal articles, reports, theses, etc.) have to be preserved in one of ITC’s approved data repositories or archive facilities for at least ten years after completion of the project (in accordance with The Netherlands Code of Conduct for Academic Practice).   \\nPreserved in a repository, research data can be published publicly, with restricted access, or embargoed. In accordance with the ITC’s Open Science Strategic Plan, the data should be published as open as possible and as closed as necessary, i.e., in case of legitimate reasons, such as ethical reasons, reasons concerning privacy protection and national security reasons, knowledge safety and export control, confidentiality, commercial interest, legal and contractual obligations reasons. However, the metadata must always be made available publicly.   \\nDigital research data that cannot be shared with third parties, including trusted data repositories, must be archived in UT’s archive facility.   \\nResearch data underlying master's and PhD research projects must be preserved before graduation. Research data underlying other types of research projects must be preserved no later than one month after completion of the research project. Non-digital research data, wherever possible and appropriate, should be digitised. If the data is to be preserved in non-digital format, they should be stored securely in accordance with the respective department’s common practices.   \\nThe primary author and co-authors of academic publications share the responsibility of controlling access and making any decision with respect to the data and, therefore, should all be acknowledged in the metadata of the archived or published datasets as contact persons.   \\nFor research projects run by ITC researchers, access to the data with restricted access is controlled by the principal investigator. In situations where the original researchers are not available or no longer affiliated with ITC, access to the data is determined and granted by the department chair.   \\nArchived or published digital and non-digital research data require sufficient documentation to enable proper interpretation and re-use, as described in the section on Data Documentation.  \\n\\nFor publishing research data, UT and ITC recommend two trusted research data repositories: DANS and 4TU.ResearchData.  \\n\\nTrusted repositories are the repositories that have received a Core Trust Seal Certification, which warrants the reliability and durability of data repositories and, hence, the potential for storing data over a long period of time.  \\n\\nFor archiving research data, UT has a certified facility for long-term research data archiving known as AREDA. It is required to contact the Faculty Data Steward before archiving data in AREDA.   \\nFor archiving research data from master research projects, ITC has a separate archive facility.\",\n",
       " '5.7 Personal, Confidential, and Classified Research Data Management  \\n\\nWarranting the protection of confidential data, privacy, and the rights of research subjects is paramount in all research activities conducted within ITC. This section outlines key principles, ctices, and compliance measures related to the handling of personal and confidential data in research:  \\n\\nAll research activities involving personal data must adhere to the principles and requirements outlined in the GDPR;   \\nResearchers should only collect the minimum amount of personal data necessary for research purposes. Collecting unnecessary or excessive personal data should be avoided; Researchers and students must report any processing of personal data through GDPR registration using the online UT DMP+GDPR tool;   \\nA Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA), i.e, risk assessment, should be carried out prior to processing any personal data likely to result in high risks to the rights and freedom of data subjects;   \\nPersonal data, confidential and classified data must be protected against unauthorised access and loss as much as possible. More particularly, personal data should be stored in a GDPR-compliant data storage facility and, where needed, additional security measures such as encryption should be applied;   \\nPersonal data should be anonymised or pseudonymised as soon as possible, preferably immediately after collecting those data. Similarly, secondary datasets containing personal data should be pseudonymised or anonymised immediately after receiving them. Note that unlike anonymised data, pseudonymised data are still personal data;   \\nPrior to sharing research data containing personal data, a data processing agreement should be drawn up in consultation with the Faculty Privacy Contact Person and should be signed by the Faculty Dean. A non-disclosure agreement is required in the case of sharing confidential and classified data; see more details under the “Data Sharing and Transferring” section in this policy;   \\nPersonal data needed for verification and reproduction (at least those underlying all types of academic publications, such as journal articles, reports, theses, etc.) have to be preserved in one of ITC’s approved data repositories or archive facilities for at least ten years after completion of the project (in accordance with The Netherlands Code of Conduct for Academic Practice);   \\nInformed consent forms used to collect personal data, either in digital or non-digital form, have to be archived for at least ten years after completion of the research project; Researchers must report any data breaches immediately. Examples of potential data breach include devices containing personal, confidential and classified data being lost or stolen, sharing these data with the unauthorised persons, etc. For more information on data breach, see Cyber Safety at UT;   \\nResearch involving human subjects or potentially sensitive data about or from individuals, groups or organisations must be reviewed by the ITC Ethics Committee before the work commences. For other types of research, it is strongly recommended to identify potential ethical issues related to, for instance, the environment, dual-use aspects, low-income countries, or artificial intelligence, through an ethics review.  \\n\\nMore information on the appropriate use of personal data in research, including a flowchart and practical guidance, can be found on the UT Cyber Safety Website.  \\n\\nThis  pre-DPIA assessment form should be used to find out whether a full DPIA is required.  \\n\\nUT network storage facilities (e.g., P-drive, Unishare,) are ISO 27001-certified, NEN 7510-certified and GDPR-compliant; therefore, they guarantee maximum security for storing and sharing personal data, confidential and classified data during research.  \\n\\nFor personal data stored in non-UT cloud storage (e.g., MS Teams, OneDrive, etc.) or on portable devices (e.g., USB sticks, external hard drives, tablets, etc.), encryption is required.  \\n\\nPersonal data stored on portable devices must be deleted as soon as possible and no later than at the end of the part of research for which the data are needed (e.g., after fieldwork).  \\n\\nThe encryption key must be kept safe and stored in a separate location. Furthermore, it should be shared with at least one other employee in the research group. Generally, this person will be the principal researcher or the chair of the research group.  \\n\\nNon-digital informed consent forms should be digitised where possible. However, UT has an archive service for non-digital informed consent forms. Please contact the Faculty Data Steward for support.  \\n\\nTo submit your application for ethics review, visit the ITC Ethics Committee website or contact the Faculty’s Research Support Officer.  \\n\\nFor support regarding the handling of personal data in research contact the Faculty’s Privacy Contact Person (PCP).',\n",
       " '# iscte INSTITUTO UNIVERSITARIO DE LISBOA  \\n\\n## RESEARCH DATA MANAGEMENT AND SHARING POLICY OF ISCTEINSTITUTO UNIVERSITÁRIO DE LISBOA  \\n\\n(approved by order of the Rector on 16 November 2023)  \\n\\nIn the current research panorama, under constant evolution, the effective management of research data is of extreme importance for higher education institutions. Iscte - Instituto Universitário de Lisboa (Iscte) acknowledges the relevance of research data as a valuable resource sustaining the integrity and quality of its academic activities. In conformity with global best practice and committed to the guiding principles of Open Science of the European Commission and Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, I.P. (FCT), Iscte fully endeavours to foster a research environment that empowers its academic community to stand out in the generation, preservation and sharing of research data.  \\n\\nThis Research Data Management and Sharing Policy reflects Iscte’s commitment to research integrity, innovation and social impact, while simultaneously contributing to the global dialogue on the responsible and effective management of research data.  \\n\\nThis policy complements the Iscte Open Access Policy and all the other institutional documents, including the Guidelines for Researchers on Personal Data Protection in Scientific Research Activities at Iscte, the Data Protection Policy of Iscte and the Code of Ethical Conduct in Research.1  \\n\\n## Contents  \\n\\nIntroduction.. 3   \\nPrinciples. 5   \\nScope. .5   \\nRequirements.. 5   \\nLiabilities. 7   \\nAdoption, implementation, evaluation. 9   \\nGlossary.. 10   \\nBibliographic references. 11  \\n\\n### Introduction  \\n\\n### Brief context  \\n\\nThe policy proposed in this document aims to be in line with the various initiatives that have been published by the European Commission, namely the Recommendation of 2012 on access to and preservation of scientific information and its update in 2018.  \\n\\nThis document also took into account the Horizon 2020 guidelines on rules of open access to scientific publications; Regulation (EU) 2021/695 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing Horizon Europe – the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation, laying down its rules for participation and dissemination, and Council Decision (EU) 2021/764 establishing the specific programme implementing Horizon Europe – the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation.  \\n\\nIt also takes into consideration important developments at a European level related to Open Science and Open Access, such as the EU Council Conclusions of 2016 on the transition towards an Open Science system, the ‘Plan S’ and ‘cOAlition S’, the developments of the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) and in particular the Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda, the action lines of the EU Open Science Policy, the Resolution on “A new ERA for Research and Innovation” and EU Directive 2019 on open data and the reuse of public-sector information and the Report \"Towards a 2030 Vision on the Future of Universities in Europe”.  \\n\\nFinally, it considers other relevant reports such as: “Perspectives on the new European Research Area from the university sector”, “Universities without walls: A vision for 2030” of the  European University Association, “Looking to the Future: the Guild’s Vision for Europe’s Universities” of The Guild of European Research-Intensive Universities, and Science Europe’s practical guide “International Alignment of Research Data Management.”  \\n\\n### Benefits and advantages of Open Science  \\n\\nOpen Science is a scientific activity conducted in an open, collaborative and transparent manner, in all fields of knowledge, from the basic sciences to the social sciences and humanities.2,3 It has the potential to increase the quality and efficiency of research and fast-track the advancement of knowledge and innovation through the sharing of results, making them more reusable and improving their reproducibility. It is based on the following principles:  \\n\\ntransparency in practices, methodology, observation and data collection;   \\nthe provision, public access, reuse and replicability of research results and methods;   \\ntransparency in scientific communication;   \\nthe use of web-based tools to facilitate scientific collaboration.  \\n\\n### Requirements of the funders  \\n\\nThe table below lists the main requirements of the Horizon Europe framework programme:4  \\n\\n Requirements Horizon Europe \\nCompliancewith theFAiRprinciples Yes \\nCompliancewith theprincipleof“asopenas possible,as closed asnecessary\" Yes \\nSubmissionofaResearchDataManagementPlan (DMP) BeneficiariesshouldsubmitthefirstversionoftheirDMP,asa deliverable,withinsixmonthsaftertheofficialprojectstarting date.

In all other respects, the provisions of article 106 in Austrian university law and Austrian copyright law in their respective valid versions shall apply.  \\n\\nIn accordance with section 106(1) sentence 1 of Austrian university law, scientific members of staff at the university shall be entitled to publish their own academic research work and results; this shall also apply to doctors during medical specialist training in accordance with section 96 of Austrian university law as well as to academic staff working on externally funded projects (project staff).9  \\n\\nIn addition, in accordance with section 106(1) sentence 2 in conjunction with sections 11 and 20 of Austrian copyright law, academic members of staff at the university who have made their own academic contribution to a research project shall have the right to be named as co-authors. Scientific members of staff who independently create copy-righted works are therefore entitled to be named as the sole author.10 If a computer program or a database (section 40f paragraph 3 Austrian copyright law) is created by an employee in fulfilment of tasks for which they are employed, the right to copyright designation according to section 40b Austrian copyright law - unless agreed otherwise - belongs to the employer.11  \\n\\nIn the case of an employee invention in accordance with section 7 paragraph 3 of Austrian patent law, the rectorate must be informed of the invention and the JKU has a right of access to it in accordance with section 106 paragraph 3 Austrian university law. In accordance with section 8 paragraph 1 Austrian patent law, the researcher is entitled to special remuneration for transferring their invention to the employer and for granting right of use with regard to such an invention (cf. SOP 8209). According to Section 20 paragraph 1 Austrian patent law, the inventor is entitled to be named as the inventor.  \\n\\n#### 4.2  Special provisions relating to the Faculty of Medicine  \\n\\nIn the case of employee inventions made by employees of the JKU or Kepler Universitätsklinikum GmbH (KUK) and the JKU, the cooperation agreement between the JKU and KUK stipulates in sections 23.1. and 28.1. that both KUK and the JKU will ensure that inventions made by their employees in the course of their work for the clinical department of the medical faculty are directly or indirectly adopted and, depending on cost bearing capacity, can be utilised for the benefit of KUK or the JKU. The costs of the special remuneration for the invention to be paid by the employer in accordance with Austrian patent law are borne by the contracting parties in proportion to the exploitation revenues they earn.

       " 'Principles of research data management  \\n\\nResearch data are stored and made available in a suitable repository or archiving system and are referenced using persistent identifiers.  \\n\\nWhen depositing data in a repository, researchers are required to declare their affiliation to the JKU in accordance with the provisions of the \"Guideline for the declaration of affiliation for publications and research projects\"12. In order to maintain the integrity of research data, it must be stored correctly, completely, unaltered and reliably, and must be findable, accessible, traceable, interoperable and, where possible, made available for re-use in accordance with FAIR principles. To enable the re-use of research data or research results by citing the original sources, the currently valid citation rules must be applied.  The storage must be dated, and subsequent changes must be stored as separately as possible from the original data. When dealing with clinical research data, it is recommended that the ALCOA+ principle of good clinical practice be applied.  \\n\\nWhenever personal data is handled, it must be in compliance with the applicable data protection regulations. When handling health data, the increased data protection requirements must be met. According to article 2 paragraph 1 of the GDPR in conjunction with article 4 paragraph 1 of Austrian privacy law, the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation and the Austrian privacy law apply to the fully and partially automated processing of personal data. If data are not processed automatically, but manually instead, the GDPR only applies if the data are stored or are to be stored in a structured file system that is organised according to specific criteria, so that access to the personal data it contains is not only possible by sequentially going through the entire collection, but there is a simplified method of indexing and locating its contents.13 Files and collections of files and their cover sheets which are not arranged according to specific criteria - and are therefore unstructured - are not covered by the GDPR; paper files, for example, such as court files in particular, are not covered.14 Also excluded are data obtained purely orally, acoustically or visually, provided they are not to be stored.15  \\n\\nIn the absence of any particular creative achievement (since the implementation and display of results is usually the task of a computer program) - individual data, raw data or results of the mere evaluation or analysis results are in principle not works in accordance with section 1 paragraph 1 of Austrian copyright law and are therefore not protected by copyright, so there is also no provision for licensing.16  \\n\\nHowever, data collections may constitute databases protected by copyright in accordance with section 40f paragraph 1 of Austrian copyright law (database works). But, if the collection of data does not achieve the necessary level of creativity (simple database), it is not protected as a collective work (section 6 Austrian copyright law); in this case ancillary copyright in accordance with section 76c onwards of Austrian copyright law applies if a substantial investment was required for the procurement, verification and presentation of the contents of the database.17 Whether or what kind of protectability applies to research data requires verification in each individual case by the department responsible for data clearing.  \\n\\nProvided that there are no third-party rights, legal obligations, ethical aspects or property regulations to the contrary, research data should be freely licensed and made openly available for re-use, while respecting intellectual property rights.  \\n\\nIn accordance with section 2f paragraph 3 of Austrian research organisation law, the minimum archiving period for research data is 10 years from publication of the research results or completion of the research activity. The administrative documents accompanying the research activities must also be archived. If research data and records are to be (or have to be) erased or destroyed, this may only be performed using a standardised process, taking into account all legal regulations, especially internal university regulations and ethical aspects. Principal investigators or their legal successors must be informed and offered the opportunity for the research data to be handed over. All measures taken must be documented and be accessible for possible later assessment.  ',\n",
       " 'What should researchers do?  \\n\\n2. Researchers at Lancaster University will identify which projects are appropriate and which data are to be archived.  In this context they will then manage their data in such a way that they:  \\n\\nensure research data and records are accurate, complete, authentic and reliable;   \\nmeet funding body grant requirements;   \\nensure that confidentiality and anonymisation requirements are achieved;   \\ncomply with the Data Protection Act and Freedom of Information legislation;   \\nmaximise research efficiency by enabling others to use the data;   \\nminimise the risk of data loss (e.g. by data backup).  \\n\\n3. More specifically, Lancaster University expects that:  \\n\\n(I) all research will be carried out according to the principles laid out in the University Research Ethics Code of Practice;   \\n(II) primary responsibility for research data management during any research project or programme lies with the principal investigator;   \\n(III) the principal investigator will be responsible for clarifying responsibilities where data ownership may be ambiguous (e.g. in a multi-partner collaboration).  If a PI leaves Lancaster their Head of Department should ensure that appropriate provision has been made for data access;   \\n(IV) every member of a research team should be familiar with the data requirements of the organisation funding their research and of this University policy;   \\n(V) each project will have a data management plan that is produced at funding application stage or at the beginning of the project.  Note that some funders will have more rigorous conditions than those described here;   \\n(VI) as a minimum, research data directly associated with publications should be archived;   \\n(VII) all research data to be archived must be associated with metadata which meets minimum standards set out in guidelines given on RSO website.  The metadata should be sufficient to enable other researchers to understand how it was created or acquired, and, if it is to be made openly available, to discover it and assess its reuse potential;   \\n(VIII) all research data will be stored in either electronic or paper form for a minimum of 10 years after the end of a project, unless ethical considerations, participant confidentiality, FOI requirements or external agencies e.g. NHS, specifically require otherwise;   \\n(IX) research data will be submitted to national or international data services and repositories where available or required by either funders or publishers and this will replace the need for local archiving;   \\n(X) exclusive rights to reuse or publish research data should not be handed over to commercial publishers or agents without retaining the rights to make the data openly available for re-use, unless this is a condition of the funding.',\n",
       " 'Research data must be managed in such a way that, at the latest, - at the point in time of the last publication arising from the research, or at the point in time of the formal completion of the research project it is preserved so that it is at least findable, accessible, comprehensible and reusable in the long term.  \\n\\nTwo instances are mentioned here because not all research culminates in a publication. However, it   \\nis then also important that the research data is preserved and is findable. Externally funded   \\nresearch projects will generally formally conclude upon their financial-administrative completion. n explanation of the criteria that are used: Findable The data must be findable for other researchers and involved parties. Its findability improves if it is deposited in a (discipline-specific) data archive or repository. The information about the data (metadata) is then registered in a standardised manner and is findable, also for search engines. Future findability is guaranteed by assigning a persistent identifier to the data. A commonly used identifier for data is DOI (digital object identifier). A DOI is assigned by a data archive or data publisher and is a unique number for a digital object, in this case a dataset. The DOI remains the same even if the location of the dataset (URL) changes. A DOI or other persistent identifier is used in citations or references to the dataset. Accessible: Data accessibility does not necessarily mean that the data must immediately be made fully open. The data will have to be made accessible in some instances, for example for verification by a grant provider or journal, but will remain inaccessible to the wider public. With sensitive data, full publication will never be an option. Research data can be retained under embargo; then only those who have deposited the data have access to it. The duration of the embargo is determined in consultation with the data archive. A further option is only to grant access if a request for access is submitted to the researcher. The researcher then knows who is consulting the data and can reach agreements about its use and reuse. NB: if the decision is made to limit access to the data, it is essential that the metadata (description of the data) is findable. Comprehensible Metadata and any supplementary documentation must describe the data in such a way that other researchers will also be able to understand and use it. Reusable This criterion is further elaborated upon in Article 7. Long-term retention This criterion is further elaborated upon in Article 8. Research data must be stored together with the metadata, other documentation and   \\npossibly the software and version of the software required for its potential reuse.  \\n\\nResearch data must be stored in such a way that it is independent of the underlying equipment/hardware, such as microscopes, scanners or recording equipment. Long-term data formats that are supported by data archives should be used if possible. Retention of hardware can be considered in certain cases, for instance in the case of software that is only compatible with an obsolete computer operating system. Close attention must be paid to the cost/benefit ratio here. 8. Once the research has been completed, the research data must be retained securely for the long term. This means that the integrity, availability and – if required – confidentiality of the data must be guaranteed. The data should be retained according to international guidelines. For digital data this can be achieved by preserving it in a Trusted Digital Repository (an online depot). Non-digital research data must be preserved according to the prevailing standards in the discipline.  \\n\\nA Trusted Digital Repository possesses equipment, hardware and software for the long term and reliable retention of digital information. This facility must be embedded in a reliable organisation that has a long-term mission and funding. There are three prevailing international standards for Trusted Digital Repositories and the manner in which they retain digital data for the long term. In ascending order of reliability requirements these are: the Data Seal of Approval1, the Nestor Seal2 (also known as DIN 31644) and the RAC standards3 (also known as ISO 16363). Data preservation at a repository with a Data Seal of Approval (the lowest category) currently suffices for NWO and Horizon 2020. It is recommended to digitise non-digital data as far as possible for long-term retention.  ',\n",
       " 'Guidelines concerning research data storage at the Faculties of Humanities and Theology  \\n\\nLund University is a public authority and is therefore obliged to preserve, organise and maintain all public documents from the University’s activities (Swedish Archives Act 1990:782, section 3). As documents resulting from research at the Faculties of Humanities and Theology are increasingly digital, it is of the utmost importance to establish procedures to ensure that the data will remain available in a way that corresponds to the current paper documents.  \\n\\nThe long-term goal of introducing these new procedures is to promote:  \\n\\nopen research   \\ngood research practice and good data management in the research process good regulatory compliance   \\nfuture access to research data.  \\n\\nResearch data1 refers to all types of research documents defined in Lund University’s document management plan2, i.e. both those to be preserved and those to be disposed of after a specified retention period. Any disposal must be in accordance with the Swedish National Archives’ regulations. The rules that apply can be found in the document “Gallrings- och bevarandeplan för forskningshandlingar inom de Humanistiska och teologiska fakulteterna” (Disposal and preservation plan for research documents at the Faculties of Humanities and Theology), reg. no V 2019/2171. Storage of research data should also take into account current rules regarding e.g. information and IT security, personal data processing and ethical principles.  \\n\\nDoctoral students’ research documents are considered part of Lund University’s portfolio of public documents and are therefore also covered by these guidelines.  \\n\\nWhen the term “researcher” is used below, it refers all research staff, regardless of the type of employment, and thus also all research students.  \\n\\nThe short-term goal of introducing these procedures is to clarify the organisation’s requirements and expectations of researchers, and to:  \\n\\nsupport researchers in their data management by providing storage space   \\nfor research data during and after the project period   \\nensure that the faculty’s research data can always be found, without help   \\nfrom the researcher   \\nprepare for the possibility of somewhat automatically transferring data and   \\nmetadata to a planned e-archive at Lund University, without requiring each   \\nresearcher to participate in the process  \\n\\nIn addition to having a clearly identified location for research project data3, we need to be able to distinguish between active data and archived data. We also need to organise the data in a structured manner. Long-term preservation must take place in open file formats that make the data accessible even in the long term.  \\n\\nThe legal rights and obligations apply, irrespective of the choice of storage solution. The same rules apply as long as the document is stored with the public authority – regardless of where or how it is stored.  \\n\\nBear in mind that there are other requirements that apply to research data, in addition to these storage guidelines. If, for example, the project processes personal data, this must be reported via the PULU4 form. Ethical review may also be required, etc.  \\n\\nBy following the research data storage procedures below, we also:  \\n\\nsatisfy the Swedish Archives Act’s requirement to preserve and keep research documents organised   \\nare able to link research projects in LUCRIS to their research data   \\nenable secure storage during the project period and prepare for e-archiving ensure that research data remains at LU, even after the researcher’s employment has terminated   \\nenable responding, if necessary, to suspicions of research misconduct by being able to produce evidence in the form of preserved research data facilitate the creation of well-organised data sets that can easily be cited, shared and re-used by the researcher or others to answer new research questions, if needed.',\n",
       " 'Research data storage procedures at the Faculties of Humanities and Theology  \\n\\nThe procedures apply to all researchers working at the Faculties of Humanities and Theology and to all research projects that have their main residence at one of the faculty organisations. In brief, this means that the research data during the project period should, and at the end of the project must:  \\n\\nbe stored in a project folder associated with the applicable storage solution be organised according to the standard structure   \\ncontain metadata about the project and its data   \\ncontain the necessary documentation   \\nbe stored in open file format   \\nbe given file names that facilitate understanding of the content   \\nbe disposed of5, if possible, at the end of the retention period.  \\n\\nThe research project manager in charge is also responsible for ensuring that the project’s research data is stored securely throughout the project period and that the right people have access to the project data. You must also ensure that the necessary decisions on disposal/preservation are taken no later than at the end of the project (see below).  \\n\\nBelow are more detailed descriptions of the requirements and related comments.  \\n\\nDuring the project period, the project data must be stored in a work folder specifically intended for the project, in the storage solution provided by the IT unit.  \\n\\nThis ensures secure storage of data during the project period. If another storage solution is chosen, for example, if an equivalent solution is provided by another IT provider, an assessment of information security must be made. In cases where the research data is of such a sensitive nature that the storage solution does not meet all the information security considerations or ethical principles, another storage solution must be chosen6.  \\n\\nThe project folder shall contain the following four main subfolders:  \\n\\nAdministration Method   \\nData   \\nResearch output  \\n\\nOnly research documents that are not suitable for LUCRIS may be added to the Research output folder.  \\n\\nThe requirement applies primarily to the archived project folder, but in order to avoid further work in connection with the archiving process, we recommend that you apply this structure in the project folder already during the project period. The research project manager is free to determine the organisation of the data within these folders, but consideration should be given to making the structure understandable and logical for other researchers.  \\n\\nMetadata on the project and its data shall be stored in the Data folder.  \\n\\nAt least one README file shall be placed at the top of the folder. The text should explain what can be found in the folder, how different files relate to each other, etc. in order for other researchers to understand and possibly utilise the research data.  \\n\\nThe minimum requirement for project metadata is based on the “OpenAIRE guidelines for Data Archives”7, which in turn are based on the Dublin Core8. Metadata is important for future indexing, searching and possibly also statistics. Text elements that are part of the metadata structure must be written in either Swedish or English. The libraries at the Faculties of Humanities and Theology provide a template for this. The template includes requirements for a link to the project in LUCRIS.  \\n\\nIf necessary, additional README files or other information documents may be added to the structure if deemed necessary by the research project manager.  \\n\\nRequired documentation in addition to metadata.   \\nOther documentation that is necessary for an outside researcher to understand and interpret the contents of the folder may be e.g. method descriptions, field journals and manuals for applied software or hardware. The files in the folder must be stored in open file format.   \\nThe choice of file format for digital documents is very important in order to ensure that the data will remain accessible in the future. Non-proprietary open formats shall be used as far as possible.

Decisions on disposal must always be taken in accordance with current regulations (see “Gallrings- och bevarandeplan för forskningshandlingar vid de Humanistiska och teologiska fakulteterna” (Disposal and preservation plan for research documents at the Faculties of Humanities and Theology), reg. no V 2019/2171)10, i.e. disposal of documents requires approval from the head of department.  \\n\\nFor research ethical reasons, research data shall be stored for at least 10 years after publication, in order to enable critical review of the research findings.  \\n\\nIf the project processes personal data, this must be reported to the data protection officer at the end of the project, as the register (the PULU system) must only contain ongoing processing of personal data.  \\n\\nData eligible for disposal are automatically disposed of at the end of the retention period.  \\n\\nAfter assessing the preservation value, which is done in consultation between researchers and the head of department (see above), the IT unit transfers the documents deemed disposable after the retention period by the head of department to the corresponding folder at the intermediate archive of the Faculties of Humanities and Theology. The documents will automatically be disposed of at the end of the retention period. The documents that are to be preserved remain in the project folder, which is then transferred in its entirety to the storage solution for archived material.',\n",

       " '7 Principles  \\n\\nThe principles which underpin the use and management of research data by University staff and students are set out below. These principles are consistent with the principles of data protection set out in Article 5 of the General Data Protection Regulation6 and satisfy the requirements in Schedule 1, Part 4, 39 of the UK Data Protection Act 2018:  \\n\\ni) Research data will be managed throughout the research data lifecycle7 in accordance with the University’s policies, guidelines and standards, and funder, legislative and ethical requirements.   \\nii) Research data shall in most cases be collected for the purposes of creating new knowledge which is shared with others through publication and dissemination. In these cases, research is normally deemed to be ‘a task in the public interest’ (principles of lawfulness and purpose limitation Art.6 GDPR). In cases where special category data are being processed, then an additional condition will apply. For most research carried out by the University  \\n\\nthis will normally be that processing is necessary for ‘scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes’ (GDPR Art.9).  \\n\\niii) Data management plans should be written for all new research projects, regardless of whether submission of such plans is required when applying for research funding.  The plan must address how the data will be captured, managed, stored, retained, shared, published, and how any confidentiality and data protection issues will be addressed.8 See also Section 10 for further guidance on data management plans.  \\n\\niv) Personally identifiable data should be anonymised or pseudonymised where possible as soon after collection as possible. Where researchers can undertake some or all of their research activities without using identifiable personal data, they should make arrangements to do so (principle of data minimisation). Where research requires the processing of personal data, and where the University is the data controller, then there must be a clear legal basis for processing and this must be communicated to the data subject (principle of lawfulness, fairness and transparency).9  \\n\\nv) Where personal data are stored and processed for research purposes by University staff this must be carried out in accordance with the University’s information security policy (principle of integrity and confidentiality).10  \\n\\nvi) Data should be made available for access and re-use where legally, ethically and commercially appropriate.  \\n\\nvii) Researchers must provide sufficient metadata and explanatory documentation about their research data to ensure that data are discoverable, understandable and re-useable.  Such metadata will be published by the University, normally within 12 months of the data being generated.  If access to data is restricted, the metadata should outline the reasons for this and the conditions which need to be met for access to be granted.  \\n\\nviii) Data must be retained in an appropriate format for a period of at least 1 year from the end of the project for low risk projects, 3 years for moderate risk projects and 7 years for high risk projects, in accordance with the University’s Research Records Retention Schedule (principle of storage limitation)11, unless other funder regulations apply (for example, EPSRC stipulates a retention period of 10 years, plus an additional 10 from the last date at which access to the data was requested by a third party).  Where possible and applicable, research data that are not in a digital format will be digitised to facilitate access.  \\n\\nix) Where possible, or if mandated by the funder, retained data must be submitted to an appropriate archive or database for long-term preservation.  \\n\\nResearchers should avoid retaining data using methods that might not persist for 10 years, such as project websites.  \\n\\nx) All data which are created as part of research at Northumbria University must be registered with the University, even if the data are hosted elsewhere.  All reasonable steps must be taken to ensure that research data are not stored in a jurisdiction that offers lower levels of protection than are available in the UK.  \\n\\nxi) Published papers should include a statement describing how, and on what terms, supporting research data may be accessed.',\n",
       " '3 UNIVERSITY POLICY  \\n\\n3.1 Research data will be managed to the highest standards throughout the research data lifecycle as part of the NTU’s commitment to research excellence.   \\n3.2 Responsibility for research data management through a sound research data management plan during any research project or programme lies primarily with the Principal Investigators (PIs).  \\n\\n3.3 All new research proposals, from 30 June 2014, must include research data management plans or protocols that explicitly address data capture, management, integrity, confidentiality, retention, access, sharing and publication.  \\n\\n3.3.1 A data plan should be made for each proposed research project or funding application.   \\n3.3.2 Sufficient metadata should be created and stored to assist with discovery and reuse.   \\n3.3.3 The data plan should comply with relevant legislative frameworks such as (but not limited to) data protection, intellectual property, ethics and human rights.   \\n3.3.4 The data plan should evolve and be version controlled as the project develops.   \\n3.3.5 The final data plan should be retained within NTU alongside the project data outputs (in accordance with the Retention Policy).  \\n\\n3.4 NTU will provide training, support, advice and where appropriate guidelines and templates for research data management and research data management plans.  \\n\\n3.4.1 NTU will provide mechanisms and services for storage, backup, registration, deposit, retention and access of research data assets in support of current and future access, during and after completion of research projects. This includes tools to ensure the stored Research Data is discoverable and accessible. Once a project has closed, the Research Data should be offered and assessed for preservation in NTU supported repository.   \\n3.4.2 On project completion, the Principal Investigator is responsible for data transformation or format conversion required to archive and access the Research Data.   \\n3.4.3 On project completion, the Principal Investigator should ensure all relevant Research Data is made available in the location specified in the data management plan.  \\n\\n3.5 Any Research Data which is to be retained elsewhere, for example in an international data service or domain repository should be registered with NTU. The registration must include the retention and access policy of the relevant data service to help determine compliance with this Policy.  \\n\\n3.6 Principal Investigators are responsible for ensuring that any external Research Data to be incorporated into their research is registered with NTU. The registration must include the retention and access policy governing the Research Data to help determine compliance with this Policy.  \\n\\n3.7 Research data management plans must ensure that research Data are available for access and re-use where appropriate and under appropriate safeguards.  \\n\\n3.8 Principal Investigators are responsible for deciding, subject to legal, ethical and commercial constraints, which Research Data are to be released to meet their obligations. Research Data shall be released for access and re-use as soon as practicable after research activity is completed and results published.  \\n\\n3.9 The privacy and other legitimate interests of the subjects of Research Data must be protected.  \\n\\n3.10 Research Data of future historical interest, and all Research Data that represent records of NTU, including data that substantiate research findings, will be offered and assessed for deposit and retention in an appropriate national or international data service or domain repository, or an NTU repository.  \\n\\n3.11 As a basic principle NTU should retain the right to use its Research Data and outputs for its own teaching and non-commercial research purposes.  Exclusive rights to reuse or publish Research Data should not be granted to commercial publishers or agents without retaining the rights to make the data openly available for re-use. Where the granting of such exclusive rights is a requirement of the funder, advice should be sought from NTU’S Legal Services Team to ensure that NTU can comply with its obligations under charity law.  \\n\\n3.12 If Research Data is to be deleted or destroyed, either because the agreed retention period has expired or for legal or ethical reasons, this should be done so in accordance with all legal, ethical, research funder and collaborator requirements with particular attention to confidentiality and security.  \\n\\nNTU has a range of policy documents and guidance which offers advice and sets out the regulations pertaining to a number of areas, some of which may impact on the Research Data Management Policy:  \\n\\nCode of Practice for Research Professional Standards in research Legal Agreements and Intellectual Property IT Security policy Staff Disciplinary Procedures',\n",
       " \"Data Management Principles  \\n\\nResearch data must be retained and disposed of securely according to the relevant retention and disposal schedule.  This can be found at:  \\n\\nRecords Retention Policy  \\n\\n7.2 Research data that underpins published results or is considered to have long-term value should be retained.  The default period for research data retention is 10 years from date of last requested access. However, retention periods should, as a minimum, conform to the requirements of a funding agency or body.  \\n\\n7.3 Retained data must be deposited in an appropriate data service, or as mandated by the funder or otherwise directed.  \\n\\nA statement describing how and on what terms any supporting data may be accessed must be included in research outputs.  \\n\\n7.5 Where research is undertaken in partnership or under contract with a third party, a collaboration agreement must be signed before the start of the research that clearly addresses data ownership and partner responsibility for data storage.  \\n\\n7.6 Data placed on temporary storage must be transferred back onto the approved storage platform as detailed in the DMP as soon as the requirement for temporary storage has ended.  \\n\\n7.7 Research proposals should consider whether storage requirements may exceed those currently offered by the University.  Any such potential requirement should be discussed in advance of the application with both IT and the RDM Working Group.  \\n\\n7.8 Before staff leave the university, data of long-term value produced using University resources must remain accessible to the University.  Ownership of the data should be transferred to another member of staff on agreement of the Head of Division.  \\n\\n7.9 At the completion of a project, the PI must assess what data are of long-term value, and whether the data can be made openly available in a manner consistent with relevant legal, ethical and regulatory frameworks.  \\n\\n7.10 If research data are to be deleted or destroyed, this should be done in accordance with all legal, ethical and funder requirements and only after the written approval of the Head of Division.  \\n\\n7.11 Retained data suitable for external access should be stored on QMU's institutional data repository, eData unless an alternative is mandated by the funder.  \\n\\nLibrary Services manages QMU's open-access data repository, eData.  It exists to preserve datasets that support research outputs published by QMU researchers, as required by funder or publisher mandates, and to maximise their sharing and reuse.  \\n\\nDatasets shared in eData should be used in accordance with the Terms in the QMU  \\n\\nRepositories Policy.   \\n7.12 After a project, a metadata record describing retained data must be made publicly available within 12 months of the project completion.   \\n7.13 Metadata and documentation about research data should provide sufficient contextual information to enable the data to be discovered, accessed, understood, interpreted and reused by future users.   \\n7.14 If access to the data is restricted, the published metadata should provide the reasons for the restrictions and summarise the conditions that must be satisfied for access to be granted.   \\n7.15 All users of research datasets should acknowledge the sources of their data and abide by the terms and conditions under which they were accessed, in order to recognise the intellectual contributions of research teams and supporting organisations.   \\n7.16 Research data must be managed throughout its lifecycle in compliance with relevant legislation.   \\n7.17 Unless there are ethically and legally justified reasons for doing otherwise, researchers working with human subjects must ensure that they have an auditable record of each study participant’s explicit informed consent. to obtain, hold and use their personal data as per research ethics guidance.   \\n8 Cloud Storage   \\n8.1 For the purposes of this policy, ‘Cloud’ storage refers to third party web-based data storage such as Microsoft OneDrive, Google Drive, Dropbox etc.   \\n8.1 No cloud storage services should be used to store research data other than the University provided OneDrive account, unless mandated by the funder or statutory body.   \\n8.2 Personal OneDrive accounts should not be used to store or access research data. Only accounts linked to QMU credentials should be used.   \\n8.3 Prior to research staff leaving the employment of QMU, data stored in their OneDrive account should be transferred to an existing member of staff’s account as directed by the Head of Division.  This is to avoid loss of access to data.  \\n\\nAdvice can be sought from IT if required via the Helpdesk assist@qmu.ac.uk.  \\n\\n8.4 Care must be taken when sharing data via OneDrive to ensure continuation of data security and privacy.  \\n\\n8.5 Multi Factor Authentication should be enabled for access to the OneDrive folder on any connected device.  Assistance on this can be provided by the IT team via the Helpdesk, assist@qmu.ac.uk.\",\n",
       " 'Preface  \\n\\nThe QuTech Research Data Management Policy is part of the central TU Delft Research Data Framework Policy (which outlines the roles of the Library, ICT Department, University Services and the Executive Board at TU Delft).1 This policy helps create effective practices for working with research data at the research institute, and defines data management roles and responsibilities of the different stakeholders within QuTech from the 1st of April 2022 onwards.  \\n\\nThe principles outlined in this policy are elaborated in more detail, with supporting information available in the online guidance.  \\n\\nThis policy is motivated by the belief that good data management is an essential research skill, leads to research that is more time- and cost-efficient as it prevents data and information loss and duplication of efforts and is required to guarantee the quality, reproducibility and impact of research. This policy is inspired by the FAIR principles: research data should be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) by archiving the data with proper documentation.  \\n\\nThis policy cultivates:  \\n\\nBest practice for ensuring that scientific arguments and results are reproducible in the long term.   \\nBetter exposure of academic work of researchers at QuTech and TU Delft leading to recognition of the quality of the research process.   \\nResponsible management of research data, including the protection of intellectual property rights and export control of data   \\nImproved practices for meeting the demands of funders and publishers with respect to research data management and sharing.   \\nLong term preservation of the data underlying publications for future researchers within and outside the research group. This cannot be guaranteed by publishing the data in supplementary materials or by only making the data available upon request.  \\n\\nThis policy recognises that:  \\n\\nIndividual divisions and research groups have different working practices and processes and will therefore require dedicated guidelines.   \\nResearch Data Management covers the entire process of managing research data from its creation to its re-use and preservation, which is not equal to Open Science. While it is beneficial to publish research data openly, there might be valid ethical, legal, security or commercial implications, which will make data unsuitable for open sharing.   \\nResearch data is the evidence that underpins answers to research questions, and which is necessary to validate research findings, and includes but is not limited to measurement data, source code, algorithms, simulations and models and other forms of information supporting traditional publications.  \\n\\nThe term raw data is not always uniquely defined. Moreover, this policy recognizes that not necessarily all binary data generated (e.g., by a physical measurement or simulation run) is or was useful for scientific studies or was accessible to the researcher. Therefore, in this policy the term raw data should be interpreted as a sufficient set of data necessary to fully verify and/or replicate the experimental, theoretical or computational results presented as research findings. There is a limit on the amount of information on reproducing research data that is possible to convey by publishing data, and there always remains know-how and expertise (e.g. operating measurements, sample preparation, etc) which is not easy to document and is not usually made public. Some researchers of QuTech are also affiliated with faculties of TU Delft with their own research data policy. If a policy point is not noted here, they should follow the research data policy of their faculty, but otherwise the most stringent requirement needs to be followed.  \\n\\nThe key points of this policy are:  \\n\\nAll individuals involved in research follow the research data management strategy of QuTech and their research group.   \\nAll individuals involved in research attend data management training when required or needed.   \\nResearch data and code needed to reproduce research findings are appropriately documented, stored and shared in a suitable repository. More specifically, the raw and derived data, as well as software scripts used for the full data processing chain, that produce the final figures or tables of a research article are to be published in a trusted data repository (e.g. 4TU.ResearchData or Zenodo.org)   \\nData Stewards can assist researchers in these activities.',\n",
       " 'Research data management in education  \\n\\nResearch data pertaining to Bachelor’s or Master’s theses are stored at a facility that is adequate in terms of availability (the data may not inadvertently be lost), integrity (the data may not inadvertently be modified) and confidentiality (the data may not inadvertently be made available to unauthorised persons). Radboud University provides a system that is suitable for this purpose. Education institutes are free to use this system at their own discretion.  \\n\\nThe retention period for research data pertaining to Bachelor’s and Master’s theses is equivalent to the legal retention period for theses, i.e., seven years.  \\n\\nWithin the Bachelor’s and Master’s programmes, attention is paid to RDM in a manner that is appropriate to the discipline and the phase of the study programme. Bachelor’s and Master’s theses include a statement on the management of the research data pertaining to the thesis.  \\n\\nThe Director of Education is responsible for implementing and enforcing the RDM policy, insofar as it relates to academic higher education.  \\n\\nIt is also possible that research data pertaining to Bachelor’s or Master’s theses are part of the research that has been carried out by a researcher or Project Manager. In this case, the general principles for research data management within scientific research, as described in the previous sections, apply.  \\n\\n## Appendix 1: Findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability (FAIR)  \\n\\nThe findability and accessibility of research data are requirements in Radboud University’s research data management (RDM) policy. The definitions of these requirements are based on the common definitions of the FAIR principles (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable). These can be found in the influential paper by Wilkinson and colleagues (2016)1 and on the GO FAIR initiative website2. An explanation of FAIR can also be found on Radboud University’s RDM website.  \\n\\nFindability means that research data can be found in a simple, unambiguous and sustainable manner, both within and outside the organisation, also by persons other than the researcher him or herself. Internal findability refers to the idea that data can be found by colleagues, for instance, and that data can be found for the purpose of gathering management information on RDM and research output. External findability refers to the idea that data can be found by peers who are interested in research data associated with a publication, for instance, and that datasets can be found by search engines. This is made possible in the following way:  \\n\\nDatasets are assigned a persistent identifier (PID). A PID is a permanent and unique reference that is independent of the data storage location. A well-known example of a PID is a DOI (Digital Object Identifier).   \\nData are accompanied by rich metadata. Metadata is defined as the data that describe the properties of data or a dataset, e.g., title, author, date, descriptive notes and applicable access restrictions. Comprehensive and detailed metadata enhance the findability of a dataset. Rich metadata also include descriptions of the context, content and properties of the data, as part of the documentation of a dataset.   \\nThe PID of the dataset is part of the metadata that describe the data.   \\nData and/or metadata are registered or indexed in a searchable information source. Th registration or indexing makes it possible to find the chosen archive and its subsequent content via common search engines such as Google Scholar.  \\n\\nAccessibility is not about making research data accessible to everyone at all times, but about the proper regulation and registration of the conditions under which it is possible to access the data and how this can be done (effective access management). This is made possible in the following way:  \\n\\nAccess to data and/or metadata is regulated through a standardised protocol and, if necessary, an access procedure is also used.   \\nThe metadata are preserved, even when the full dataset is no longer available.3 This makes it possible to find researchers, organisations and publications that relate to the original research, even at a later date.  \\n\\nRadboud University seeks to ensure the interoperability and reusability of research data. However, these are not current requirements in Radboud University’s RDM policy. Interoperability requires that data can be interpreted and combined, both by people and through automation. Reusability requires that data and metadata are accompanied by explanatory information and that they are accurately described to the point that it is possible to reuse, replicate and combine the data in different contexts and situations.  \\n\\n## Appendix 2: Tasks and responsibilities of the data stewards  \\n\\nEach of Radboud University’s research institutes has one or more data stewards. The summary shown below outlines their work activities, distinguishing between their essential tasks and responsibilities and optional activities. The essential tasks and responsibilities apply to all Radboud University data stewards, while optional tasks or responsibilities may be carried out or borne by some data stewards.  \\n\\nEssential tasks: What do Radboud University data stewards at any rate?  \\n\\nAdvise researchers on the management and storage of research data during a research study and for the longer term, which includes the possible publication of data.   \\nActively contribute to the implementation and subsequent improvement of RDM within their own institute.   \\nActively contribute to the implementation of the institute’s RDM policy and, if necessary, make suggestions for updating this policy.   \\nAssist in the compliance with the RDM policy within the institute and have a basic understanding of such compliance.   \\nAre familiar with the ethical and legal issues that relate to the research data within their own discipline, and are able to refer researchers to the relevant advisors and committees in this field.   \\nInform the research institute’s board about the implementation of and compliance with the research institute’s RDM policy.   \\nStay abreast of new developments and take part in the activities and initiatives within Radboud University that pertain to RDM.  \\n\\nOptional tasks: Which tasks may be part of a data steward’s job, but are not part of the standard range of tasks?  \\n\\nProvide feedback on data management plans and sections on data management.

       " 'Responsibilities\\n\\nThis section presents the key roles and responsibilities of the RCA and its researchers. The RCA is fully committed to excellence in research data management and will thus provide support to researchers so that they may fulfil their responsibilities, set out in this section. Key support will be provided by RCA’s Schools and Centres, Research Support Office, Library and IT as outlined here.\\n\\n### 5.1 The Royal College of Art\\n\\n5.1.1 Schools and research centres 5.1.1.1 RCA Schools and Research Centres are responsible for promoting this policy to their researchers and ensuring that they adhere to their obligations listed in section 5.2.\\n\\n5.1.2 Research and Knowledge Exchange Office\\n\\n5.1.2.1 As part of grant application review and approval process Research and Knowledge Exchange staff are responsible for ensuring that all applications include a Data Management Plan.\\n\\n5.1.2.3. Research and Knowledge Exchange Office will advise researchers on any ethical or legal issues that may hinder data sharing/openness.\\n\\n#### 5.1.3 Library\\n\\n5.1.3.1 The Scholarly Communications Librarian, with the support of IT, will provide advice on all aspects of RDM. This includes advising researchers on data repositories, metadata standards, data formats, PDIs, data citation, copyright and data licences.\\n\\n5.1.2.2 The Scholarly Communications Librarian, in consultation with the Research and Knowledge Exchange Office as needed, will advise on the development of generic and funder-specific DMPs.\\n\\n5.1.3.2 The Library will maintain a collection of latest versions of funder DMP templates and the RCA generic template.\\n\\n5.1.3.3 The Library maintains a publicly available RCA research data catalogue in ePrints based on the information provided to them by PIs. The Library will facilitate the discovery and re-use of research data through publishing sufficient metadata and description of each dataset. Formats that aid re-use should also be used as far as possible.\\n\\n#### 5.1.4 IT\\n\\n5.1.4.1 IT will provide secure storage for research data throughout the research project lifecycle.\\n\\n5.1.4.2 IT will provide technical advice on data storage, backup and archiving of data.\\n\\n5.1.4.3 IT will contribute technical support and advice to researchers on RDM.\\n\\n5.1.4.4 IT, more specifically Information Management, will provide support on support and advice to researchers on legal issues relevant to research data and RDM, e.g. Data Protection (GDPR), and Intellectual Property Rights (IPR).\\n\\n5.2 Principal Investigators\\n\\n5.2.1 Principal Investigators (PIs) have overall responsibility for management of data created or used within their research. This extends also to data used within their research groups. RCA Research and Knowledge Exchange, Library and IT will provide guidance and services to support PIs in the responsibilities outlined here.\\n\\n5.2.2 PIs are responsible for providing Data Management Plans (DMPs) for all research conducted within the RCA. Funder- specific DMP templates should be used where these are available, otherwise the RCA specific templates should be used. Support for this task will be provided to PIs by RCA Library and the Research and Knowledge Exchange Office (refer to Section 5.1 of this policy).\\n\\n5.2.3 During the research process, PIs are responsible for ensuring that their research data is stored securely, to minimize risk of loss or unauthorised access, through using RCA provided services.\\n\\n5.2.4 PIs are responsible for ensuring that research data from completed projects, and that of their group, are preserved and described in ways that maximise the opportunity for discoverability and re-use. This includes the responsibility for supplying adequate metadata and documentation so that data can be found and easily understood, as well as choosing an appropriate data format/s to aid re-usability. Library staff will provide support for both these tasks (refer to clause 5.1.3.1 of this policy).\\n\\n5.2.5 PIs are responsible for identifying and preserving all research data that can be used to validate published research findings in the future, irrespective of whether this data can be shared or opened.\\n\\n5.2.6 PIs are responsible for identifying which data can be shared. The minimum is all data that is relevant to supporting published findings. If this is data from human subjects, PIs are responsible for conducting any data sharing in a legal and ethical manner. PIs also have responsibility to know, and comply with, funder requirements in this respect.\\n\\n5.2.7 PIs shall publish their sharable research data in a publicly available repository, no later than at the point of publication of findings. Should funder requirements differ, with respect to timing of deposit, or which repository should be used5, these take precedence. Before publishing data in a repository, PIs should consider the following:\\n\\n5.2.7.1 The use of embargoes: If the PI is not able to publish data before the funder’s deadline, they should request an extension of the embargo period from the funder. This means that the data remains available only to the researcher for a set period of time.\\n\\n5.2.7.2 Copyright and Intellectual Property Rights: PIs should not share data that infringes on copyright and IPR. Where third-party data is used, access conditions should be understood and followed and any data used should be cited appropriately. Researchers should also refer to the RCA Policy on Ownership, Protection and Exploitation of Intellectual Property Rights for further guidance.\\n\\n5.2.7.3 Commercialisation: PIs engaged in collaborative research with commercial partners must acknowledge that data provided by these may be restricted for commercial reasons. In the case of funded research, PIs should familiarise themselves with funder requirements regarding data management and sharing from commercial research.\\n\\n5.2.7.4 Licencing: PIs should select a licence under which to publish their data and aim for licences that permit sharing and reuse.\\n\\n5.2.7.5 Ethical concerns: PIs should take into consideration any ethical issues that may prevent data from being shared. Researchers should refer to the RCA Research Ethics Policy for further guidance.\\n\\n5.2.7.6 Privacy: PIs should take all measures to protect privacy of research subjects and should thus anonymise personal data before sharing it. Researchers must understand how some data may not be anonymised to a sufficient standard, which may prevent data from being shared. Researchers should refer to the RCA Research Ethics Policy and the RCA Data Protection Policy for further guidance.\\n\\n5.2.8 Any software developed as part of a research project, should also be managed under this policy.\\n\\n5.2.9 PIs should ensure that all published data has a Persistent Digital Identifier (PDI) and inform the Library of the location of the data, the PDI and the relevant metadata. Repositories, such as the RCA research repository (ePrints), generally issue a PDI for each dataset.\\n\\n5.2.10 Funding for RDM should be requested at application stage where this is an eligible cost allowed by the research funder. Research and Knowledge Exchange Office will assist researchers with the calculation and estimation of costs.\\n\\n5.2.11 PIs will ensure that shareable research data is made publicly available in line with funder requirements or for 10 years, whichever is longer.',\n",
       " \"Recommendations for the opening of research data within the Sorbonne University Alliance\\n\\nTo implement the policy of opening up research data, the institutions of the Sorbonne University Alliance have set themselves the following objectives:\\n\\nto raise awareness of open data among research staff in different communities and disciplines and promote the dissemination of good practice;\\nto advise them on compliance with contractual requirements requested by funding agencies, drafting of data management plans, storage/archiving solutions and their cost, allocation of identifiers, and data curation, including for sensitive data;\\nto work to facilitate the exchange of data and metadata between information systems according to the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles.\\n\\nIn this perspective of opening up and sharing data, the members of the Sorbonne University Alliance recommend setting up a Research Data Helpdesk  in the form of a portal for access to available resources, making it possible in particular:\\n\\nto identify and promote standards, infrastructure, software and IT services for data storage, access and analysis;\\nto direct users to repositories where data can be deposited and described;\\nto put users in touch with experts on technical, legal or innovation-related issues;\\nto ensure pre-publication referencing of datasets;\\nand to promote and use tools and services that support collaboration.\\n\\nIt will be up to the institutions of the Sorbonne University Alliance to co-lead a working group for the construction, steering and management of this helpdesk.\\n\\nEach institution will be able to integrate the services of this helpdesk into its own technical environment.\\n\\nA sharing of resources is clearly desirable and beneficial, subject to prior agreement between the partners concerned.\\n\\nIn the longer term, this helpdesk should also :\\n\\nallow secure access to sensitive or confidential data;\\nsupport the management of 'long tail' data from disciplines that do not have their own research data management infrastructure;\\npropose a solution to link researchers, publications, organisations and funding to the whole output, so as to provide opportunities for 'research in context'.\\n\\nIn order to implement the proposed recommendations and come up with operational solutions, staff and financial resources will be needed in each of the institutions of the Sorbonne University Alliance.\\n\\nIn addition to the initial funding that may be obtained with the PIA allocation, the institutions of the Sorbonne University Alliance undertake to :\\n\\nrespond to regional, national or international calls for projects concerning the opening up of data, either individually or jointly, with the institutions keeping each other informed of any responses to calls for projects that they may make individually;\\nensure the sustainability of the services offered in terms of access to data and metadata, whether shared, stored or archived.\",\n",
       " '1. Definition\\n\\n1.1. Research is any creative work undertaken on a systematic basis in order to increase the stock of knowledge, including knowledge of man, culture and society, and the use of this stock of knowledge to devise new applications.\\n\\n1.2. Researchers are all members of TU Wien, specifically employees and doctoral candidates, who conduct research. Persons not directly affiliated to TU Wien who are conducting research on TU Wien premises or using TU Wien facilities are also included in the term. Visiting researchers or collaborators are also expected to comply with the policy.\\n\\n1.3. Third parties are natural or legal persons, public authorities, institutions or other entities that are not affiliated to TU Wien.\\n\\n1.4. Research data refer to all information (regardless of form or presentation) needed to support or validate the development, results, observations or findings of research work, including contextual information. Research data include all materials created in the course of academic work, e.g. through digitisation, records, source research, experiments, measurements, surveys and interviews. This includes software and code. Research data can be classified as\\n\\nraw or primary data: information recorded as notes, images, video footage, paper surveys, computer files etc., processed data: analyses, descriptions and conclusions in the form of reports or papers, and published data: information distributed to others than those involved in data acquisition and administration.\\n\\n1.5. Metadata is descriptive or contextual information associated with publications and research data to assist in their identification, location and retrieval by users, while facilitating content and access management. Metadata usually takes the form of a structured set of elements.\\n\\n1.6. Persistent identifiers are identifiers attached to publications and research data that make them easier to link to and find. They must be unique and remain associated with the correct version of the publication or research data. Ideally, they provide access to digital objects through a resolver service, as digital object identifiers (DOIs) and handles do.\\n\\n1.7. The FAIR principles provide a framework to ensure that research data can be effectively reused. FAIR stands for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable.\\n\\n1.8. Data management plans (DMPs) are living documents that describe how research data will be managed during their life cycle. DMPs should state what research data will be created and how, as well as outlining plans for sharing and preserving them. Any restrictions on access to research data should be noted along with mechanisms to protect unauthorised access. In the event that research data and records are to be deleted or destroyed, the DMP should specify the person(s) responsible for taking and carrying out that decision, the storage location of the deletion process documentation, the person(s) responsible for preserving this documentation and the basis of the decision. Ideally, DMPs should be delivered in a machine-actionable format.',\n",
       " 'Validity\\n\\nThe Research Data Policy of TU Berlin was adopted by the Academic Senate on 23 October 2019 and will be continued by resolution of the Academic Senate of 15 March 2023. The policy will be reviewed by the university library within the framework of the Service Center Research Data Management every three years or when needed and will be introduced to the Academic Senate for resolution by the member of the Executive Board responsible for research.\\n\\n## Glossary\\n\\nContract research is scientific research carried out on behalf of a private or public funding organization. The task is predefined and the rights to the research results generally belong to the principal, whereby the University is granted a non-exclusive right of use for the purpose of research and teaching.\\n\\nA data management plan (DMP) is a structured guideline on how to handle research data both during and after a research project. It documents the process how the research data is generated and how it is stored appropriately so that it can be interpreted and verified, and remains available, authentic, citable, and reusable in later years. To this end, clearly defined legal parameters and appropriate security measures (such as contracts and licenses) shall also be included in the DMP. To optimize research data management and as a basis for institutional support, a DMP should be created before the start of a research project and updated in the course of the project.\\n\\nA repository is a storage platform for the archiving and worldwide publication of scientific publications, research data, or cultural heritage data. Storage of research results in a repository ensures that they are sustainably accessible, verifiable, citable, and reusable.\\n\\nThe FAIR principles are international principles for sustainably reusable research data. The main objective of the principles is to ensure that research data is optimally prepared so that it is findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. The FAIR principles were created and first published in 2016 by a broad-based interest group consisting of representatives from science, industry, funding organizations, and scientific publishers.9\\n\\nResearchers include all members of TU Berlin active in research including employees and doctoral candidates. People who are not directly connected with TU Berlin but use its infrastructure or are physically present at the University for research purposes are included in this term. Visiting researchers and external cooperative partners are expected to comply with the Research Data Policy.\\n\\nResearch Data Management (RDM) encompasses all measures for the quality assurance of research data with regard to storage, access, and preservation of research data in order to make research results sustainably reproducible and available for reuse. The activities cover the entire research data lifecycle, starting with the planning and execution of the research project, through the creation and storing of data to the long-term storage of the results after the research project is completed. Specific tasks in RDM include quality control and quality assurance, documentation, metadata creation, archiving, data exchange and reuse as well as measures for data integrity and data security.\\n\\nCooperative research is cooperation on equal terms between partners pursuing a common goal. In principle, the rights to the results belong to the partner who developed them.\\n\\nA licence for free use (or free license) is a standardized license agreement which allows research data to be reused. It regulates which rights of use the author/originator grants to the general public that go beyond the applicable copyright law. Depending on the data type, a license is selected. Established free licenses in software are the GNU General Public License (GPL), the MIT license, or the Apache license. Creative Common licenses (CC) apply to texts, images, music and videos.\\n\\nMetadata is data about data. It is data which provides descriptive or contextual information about other data, can be indexed, and facilitates archiving and retrieval. There are different types or categories of metadata. Metadata in a repository, for example, can be classified in four types of content: bibliographic metadata (e.g. title, author, abstract), structural metadata (relationships between and within objects, e.g. links, references), administrative metadata (authorizations/status, e.g. access rights, embargo), technical metadata (data evaluated by the system, e.g. size of files, checksums, modification date).\\n\\nA persistent identifier is a constant Internet address for digital objects. It guarantees that a dataset remains permanently findable, accessible, and citable, even if its physical location changes. Well known examples are DOI (digital object identifier) or URN (uniform resource name).',\n",
       " '# Open Access Research and Research Data Management Policy\\n\\n## Context\\n\\nThe “Open Research” landscape – comprising Open Access publishing and Open Data – has altered substantially since the University’s Open Access Research and Research Data Management Policy was put in place in 2013 and continues to evolve. The University recognises that the transition to Open Access continues to require significant cultural change.\\n\\nThe University of Exeter recognises that Open Access to both research papers and research data allows greater visibility of research and can stimulate new research opportunities and collaborations. Making research papers and data Open Access has been shown to increase citations. Re-use of data can lead to new research opportunities, building on existing research to further discovery.\\n\\n### The University of Exeter’s preferred means for sharing research freely and openly is through self- archiving (the so-called “green” route to Open Access) via the institutional repository (Open Research Exeter – ORE).\\n\\nThe University also supports “easy access” IP and other emerging areas that are part of the “open” landscape.\\n\\nThe University of Exeter is committed to complying with funders’ policies and recognises that the academic community requires support in interpreting and observing sometimes conflicting policies.\\n\\nThe University’s Open Access Research and Research Data Management Policy supports the HEFCE and RCUK position that publicly funded research is a public good that should be made openly available to the public when legally, commercially and ethically appropriate. This policy is designed to help support researchers comply with funding bodies’ requirements on Open Access to research papers and on research data management. This is paramount as the University risks loss of income if it fails to satisfy funders’ expectations in this area.\\n\\nThe University recognises that good practice in research data management is a key part of research excellence. Research data are the evidence that underpins the answer to the research question, and can be used to validate findings regardless of its form (e.g. print, digital, or physical)1. These might be quantitative information or qualitative statements collected by researchers in the course of their work by experimentation, observation, modelling, interview or other methods, or information derived from existing evidence. They may include, for example, experimental measurements, predictions from models, statistics, collections\\n\\nof digital images, sound recordings, transcripts of interviews, survey data and fieldwork observations with appropriate annotations, an interpretation, an artwork, archives, found objects, published texts or a manuscript.\\n\\nResearch data are a valuable asset. It is the collaborative responsibility of researchers and the institution that they are appropriately managed and stored both during and after the research process: to meet legislative, funder, information governance and University requirements; to facilitate data security (confidentiality, integrity, availability); to facilitate appropriate access, collaboration and sharing of data and results.  Good research data management brings benefits to the researcher, the University and the wider community. Examples of such benefits include ensuring that research data is stored safely thus avoiding data loss, the possibility of validating research findings and the ability to reuse and share data sets.\\n\\nThe following policy sets out the University’s expectations on Open Access and research data management.\\n\\n# Policy',\n",
       " \"4.2 Research data management procedure\\n\\nAt the start of every funded project, the researcher or lead researcher if part of a group will produce a DMP in line with the funder's specific requirements, or if no requirements are specified by the funder, then in accordance with the good practice described by DMP Online.\\n\\nDMPs should cover data types and volume, capture, storage, integrity, confidentiality, retention and destruction, sharing and deposit. A suggested minimum period of retention is ten years from the end of the project, however requirements by funders and data providers, as well as disciplinary guidance should be observed.\\n\\nDMPs must specify how and when research data will be made available for access and reuse.  Underpinning research data should be made available as soon as findings are published, under appropriate safeguards when necessary.  Academics may choose to have six months (STEM)/12 month (HAS) embargo period applied to the data.  A risk assessment is required whenever data pertaining to individuals is used. This must be approved by the relevant Research Ethical Committee prior to research commencing. Research outputs that convey findings from research data must include a data access statement that clearly provides directions for readers to obtain the data or a statement as to why the data is not available (e.g., commercial sensitivity).\\n\\nCosts such as extra storage, long-term retention, or data management effort must be addressed and included in costings to funders whose policies accept RDM costs. Note - All UK Research and Innovation funders explicitly state that all costs associated with research data management are eligible under UKRI funding.\\n\\nThe Principal Investigator/Researcher will be responsible for ensuring that the actions outlined in the DMP are carried out.\\n\\nAt the end of a project data will be deposited in the university's secure central storage solution.  Complete datasets are to be uploaded to the Universities current research information system (Pure) to enable the research support team to deposit this in the university’s secure storage solution (Arkivum). The data must include appropriate\\n\\ndescriptive metadata and, if necessary, accompanying explanatory documentation.\\n\\nDatasets within the university's central storage solution will be subject to review after ten years following date of deposit. The review will be undertaken by the researcher and the Head of Research Support. In the absence of the original researcher, an appropriate academic colleague will conduct the review with the Head of Research Support.\\n\\nIf required as a result of the review, data may be securely destroyed or kept for a further ten-year period.\\n\\n4.2 Rights to use and access research data\\n\\nIn determining access rights for research data, the legitimate interests of the subjects of research data must be protected. The rights of the public to access publicly funded research should also be considered. When open access to datasets is not legal or ethical, information governance restrictions on access and use must be applied as necessary.\\n\\nWritten agreements are required when personal data (any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person) is passed from a data controller to a data processor or another data controller, or to a country not bound by the General Data Protection Regulation or equivalent privacy legislation. Written agreements are also useful when the data being shared although not personal data, are confidential or valuable to the parties involved.\\n\\nExclusive rights to reuse or publish research data must not be passed to commercial publishers or agents without retaining the rights to make the data openly available for reuse unless this is a condition of funding.\",\n",
       " '6. Rules and Agreements with Respect to Personal Data\\n\\nIf personal data is used for research purposes, a researcher encounters the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (GDPR), which imposes additional rules and obligations.\\n\\nThe \"VSNU Code of Conduct for the Use of Personal Data in Scientific Research\" (hereinafter referred to as the \"Code of Conduct for the Use of Personal Data\") is a translation of the GDPR for societal and behavioral science research. This Code of Conduct for the Use of Personal Data gives the researcher a practical assessment framework on how to handle personal data with care. In the Code of Conduct, personal data is defined as any data relating to an identified or identifiable natural person, i.e. any data that, without disproportionate time or effort, can lead to the identification of a natural person. Personal data are either directly identifying (personal) data or not directly identifying (personal) data.\\n\\nIt is not the intention to discuss the Code of Conduct in its entirety here. Only the starting points for the standard cases are mentioned here:\\n\\nGedragscode persoonsgegevens in wetenschappelijk onderzoek, VSNU, december 2005 (Dutch\\nonly)\\n(NB the sections and page numbers mentioned here refer to the text of the Code of Conduct for the\\nUse of Personal Data) Only use lawfully collected data obtained with the consent of the respondent for a research. Exceptions are possible (see Section 3.3 onwards on page 12 of the Code of Conduct for the Use of Personal Data). Collect data sparingly: no more personal data may be collected than is necessary for the research; anonymous data should be used if possible; personal data will only be processed if there is no other option (see Section 3.2 on pages 11–12 and page 25 onwards of the Code of Conduct for the Use of Personal Data). When processing directly identifying data, two files should be created (communication data and research data). Linking takes place via an empty administration number and the access rules for the files must differ (see Section 3.6, page 13 and page 27 of the Code of Conduct for the Use of Personal Data).\\n\\nPersonal data must be protected during processing and storage so that unauthorized persons (those not involved in the research) cannot have access to them (see Chapter 4, page 15, page 29, and page 30 of the Code of Conduct for the Use of Personal Data). Publication may only be made if this cannot be traced back to persons.',\n",
       " '3 Policy Requirements\\n\\n3.1 Research data must be created, maintained and shared in accordance with contractual, legislative, regulatory, ethical and other relevant requirements at the local, national and international level. Externally-funded researchers must ensure compliance with their funder’s policy on research data management and data publication.  In cases were researchers may be affected by a number of policies, funder policy should take precedence.\\n\\n3.2 All new research proposals [from date of adoption] must include research data management plans or protocols that explicitly address data capture, management, integrity, confidentiality, retention, sharing and publication.\\n\\n3.3 The storage, management and sharing of research data carries a cost, particularly if there is a need for long-term curation and dissemination, requiring the provision of staff and system resources.  Costs for data management and sharing activities should be written into research grant applications, unless explicitly forbidden by the funder.\\n\\n3.4 Responsibility for research data management through a robust research data management plan during any research project or programme lies primarily with Principal Investigators (PIs) although all researchers have a personal responsibility to manage effectively the data they create.\\n\\n3.5 Where a project involves external collaborators, the lead organisation is responsible for putting appropriate formal agreements in place covering the contributions and rights of the various organisations and individuals involved.  All such agreements should be reviewed and approved by the University before the project begins.  In cases where the project is led by an external partner there is still a requirement for data generated or shared by Ulster University to be managed by a named individual with the University, usually the Lead Researcher at Ulster.\\n\\n3.6 Research Data must be held in a managed storage environment throughout the period of retention.  Data must be retained in an appropriate format and storage facility, normally for a period of at least 10 years from the date of any publication which it is based upon.  Where specific regulations with regard to data retention apply, eg: from funders, these regulations should prevail, particularly where the required retention period is longer than the University requires.\\n\\n3.7 The University will provide an infrastructure and support service for the storage, backup, registration, deposit and retention of research data in support of current and future access and, where appropriate, guidelines and templates for the research data management process and plans.  Appropriate safeguards will be put in place to ensure the legitimate interests of subjects of research data are protected.\\n\\n3.8 Any research data which is retained or hosted outside the University (eg: in an external repository which is subject/journal or publisher specific) must be registered with the University.\\n\\n3.9 Research data selected for archiving must be made openly available, where appropriate, with as few restrictions as possible.  Data sharing represents a key component of good research practice that contributes to the University’s strategic objective of increasing the visibility of Ulster’s research.  The University encourages researchers that have created or captured data to make it available for access and use in a timely manner, in conditions where it is feasible under contractual, legislative, regulatory, ethical or other obligations.  Where necessary, appropriate safeguards should be put in place to protect participants and ensure that access conditions are met (e.g. Anonymisation, access passwords, inclusion of rights statement) in compliance with Ulster University’s guidance on good research practice.\\n\\n3.10 Research data produced and/or used during research must in cited in research outputs.  Good research practice is built upon the recognition of all source material that contributes to the performance of research activities.  Researchers must ensure that research data used during the research process is cited in conference papers, journal articles and other research outputs. Journal publications that report on publically funded research should include an access statement that indicates how research data may be accessed and any associated conditions.\\n\\nA persistent identifier, such as a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) should be included when one is available\\n\\n3.11 Research data deemed to be of future historical interest, including data that substantiate research findings, will be offered and assessed for deposit and retention in an appropriate external data service or a University repository.\\n\\n3.12 Exclusive rights to host, reuse or publish research data should not be handed over to commercial publishers or agents without retaining the rights to make the data openly available for re-use, unless this is a condition of funding.',\n",

Principles\\n\\n(1) The University promotes best practice for research data management through clear policy, guidance, supervision, training and support.\\n(2) Researchers, service providers and, where appropriate, research sponsors and external collaborators should work in partnership to implement good practice.\\n(3) Research data will be managed by Researchers to the highest standards throughout the research data lifecycle as part of the University’s commitment to research excellence.\\n(4) Research data should be compliant to the principles of FAIR data (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Re-Useable): Findable: Identifiable, retrievable, and available when needed; Accessible: Able to be made available to others in line with appropriate legal, statutory (including data protection regulations), ethical, contractual, intellectual property, data sharing and open access principles in a suitable repository or archiving system with persistent identifiers. Interoperable: Should be accurate, complete, authentic and reliable, and where possible made available in non-proprietary formats that facilitate data exchange and re-use; Re-Useable: Assigned a licence for open use where possible in compliance with intellectual property rights, and if no third-party rights, data protection, legal requirements or property laws prohibit it.\\n(5) Research data should be kept in a manner that is compliant with legal and ethical obligations and, where applicable, the requirements of funding bodies, publishers and protocols set out in the National Policy Statement on Ensuring Research Integrity in Ireland.\\n(6) Research data should be retained in a secure environment for as long as it is of continuing value to the researcher and the wider research community, and as long as specified by research funder, publisher, patent law, legislative and other regulatory requirements. The normal minimum retention period for research data is ten years after publication or public release of the work of the research. (Longer periods apply in certain cases, such as in relation to historical data.) If data includes personal or sensitive information, informants must be informed of the data retention policy at the time data is collected, in compliance with data protection regulations.\\n\\n(7) If research data is to be deleted or destroyed, either because the agreed period of retention has expired or for legal or ethical reasons, this should be done so in accordance with all legal, ethical, research funder and collaborator requirements and with particular concern for confidentiality and security.\\n\\n(8) If a personal data breach occurs, it is to be dealt with in accordance with UCD data protection policies.\\n\\n(9) Increasingly, research projects are funded by external parties and/or involve collaboration with third parties such as other research performing organisations, charities, industry, etc.  In such cases, contractual requirements such as the funder’s terms and conditions, grant agreement(s), collaboration agreement(s), industry contract(s) etc. may apply to the project. These contractual requirements constitute legally binding obligations on the University and the Researchers involved in the project, and often include specific provisions regarding ownership, management, retention and access to data, confidentiality obligations, IT security, publication requirements etc.  Contractual obligations apply in addition to the principles and requirements contained in this policy.  If there is a conflict between this policy and a contractual obligation, the contractual obligation will override the requirements of this policy and it is the researcher’s responsibility to ensure compliance.',\n",

       " '1 Introduction\\n\\n1.1. High quality data management and storage is the cornerstone of excellent research and a key aspect of responsible research conduct. The University of Bradford recognises that research data is a valuable institutional asset and should be managed in line with the UKRI’s Common Principles on Research Data.\\n\\n1.2. Most research funders, including all research councils under the auspices of UKRI, Wellcome and charity funders have data management and sharing policies, and Data Management Plans (DMPs) are now a key part of most funding applications.\\n\\n1.3. Well managed data enables research data to be securely and reliably stored long term. It enables discoverability, accessibility and reuse where appropriate, and it supports transparency and scrutiny, facilitates collaboration and encourages the ethical re-use of data to maximise the intellectual, social, cultural and economic impact of the University of Bradford’s research.\\n\\n1.4. The University supports the Concordat on Open Research Data and UKRI’s Common Principles on Research Data.\\n\\n1.5. The aim of this policy is to ensure that researchers manage their research data effectively, enabling them to:\\n\\nDemonstrate the rigour and integrity of their research.\\nEnsure that data are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable.\\nFollow university, ethical, legal and funder requirements in relation to research data and the management of research data.\\n2.1 The Policy applies to researchers: any person who conducts research, including but not limited to: an employee; a research supervisor; a visiting researcher; an independent contractor or consultant; postgraduate research students; postgraduate taught students; a visiting or emeritus member of staff; an undergraduate student; a member of staff on a joint clinical or honorary contract, and/or a public contributor to research. The Policy applies to all subject areas of the University.\\n2.2 This Policy applies to all research irrespective of how it is funded.\\n2.3 This Policy supports and complements the Code of Practice for Research, Publications and Open Access Policy, Data Protection Policy, Research Data Management IT Security Guidance, Ethics Code, Ethical Framework, Freedom of Information Policy and the Intellectual Property Policy.\\n2.4 Research and Innovation Committee owns this Policy and oversees research data management policy implementation via an oversight committee for research computing and data management.\\n2.5 The Deputy Vice Chancellor (Research, Innovation and Engagement) is responsible for ensuring that this policy is regularly reviewed and fit for purpose.\\n\\nData Management Plan: A Data Management Plan (DMP) is a formal document that outlies how date are to be managed during the lifetime of a project and after the project has been completed. It Is the basis of effective research data management.\\n\\nData Steward: A data steward is an oversight or data governance role on a research project.\\n\\nResearch: For the purposes of this policy, “research” refers to the definition used by the Research Excellence Framework 2021:\\n\\n“Research is defined as a process of investigation leading to new insights, effectively shared”.\\n\\n“It includes work of direct relevance to the needs of commerce, industry, culture, society, and to the public and voluntary sectors; scholarship; the invention and generation of ideas, images, performances, artefacts including design, where these lead to new or substantially improved insights; and the use of existing knowledge in experimental development to produce new or substantially improved materials, devices, products and processes, including design and construction. It excludes routine testing and routine analysis of materials, components and processes such as for the maintenance of national standards, as distinct from the development of new analytical techniques. It also excludes the development of teaching materials that do not embody original research.”.\\n\\n“It includes research that is published, disseminated or made publicly available in the form of assessable research outputs, and confidential reports1”.\\n\\nResearcher: The University of Bradford’s Code of Practice for Research defines researchers as: any person who conducts research, including but not limited to: an employee; a research supervisor; a visiting researcher; an independent contractor or consultant; a postgraduate research students; postgraduate taught students; a visiting or emeritus member of staff; an undergraduate student; a member of staff on a joint clinical or honorary contract, and/or a public contributor to research.\\n\\nResearch Data: is the evidence that underpins the answer to the research question and can be used to validate findings. This might be quantitative information or qualitative statements\\n\\ncollected by researchers in the course of their work by experimentation, observation, modelling, interview or other methods, or information derived from existing evidence. Research data may take the form of numbers, symbols, text, images or sounds, including computer code, annotated fieldwork observations, or a descriptive record of a physical sample.\\n\\nResearch Data Management: Research data management is an explicit process covering the creation and stewardship of research data and materials to enable their use for as long as they retain value2\\n\\nPrincipal Investigator (PI): A principal investigator is usually a member of academic staff responsible for the administration and conduct of a research project.\\n\\nPersistent Identifiers (PID): A persistent identifier is a permanent, unique reference to an object independent of storage location. The identifier ensures machine readability and that one can always find the object, even if its name or storage location changes3. Examples of PIDs include digital object identifier (DOIs) and Open Researcher and Contributor ID (ORCID).',\n",
       " \"5.2 General Principles\\n\\n5.2.1 Researchers must comply with all legal, ethical, funding body and organisational requirements for the collection, use, re-use and storage of data, especially personal data, where particular attention should be paid to the requirements of the Data Protection Act 2018 and UK's General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR).\\n5.2.2 The ownership of research data generated by persons employed by the University of Bradford is subject to the Intellectual Property Policy. Researchers and their institutions should apply appropriate licences to clarify ownership and use of data.\\n5.2.3 They should maintain confidentiality where undertakings have been made to third parties or to protect intellectual property rights. Further expectations are elaborated in sections 6.7 and 6.8 of the University of Bradford Code of Practice for Research. Research data should be accurate, complete, authentic and reliable, and made available in a timely way with as few restrictions as possible.\\n5.2.5 Research data should be accompanied by metadata that adheres to appropriate metadata standards.\\n5.2.6 Research data should also be identifiable, and retrievable when necessary. We encourage the use of persistent identifiers (where available) for datasets, for example the Digital Object Identifier (DOI), as well as ORCID for researchers.\\n5.2.7 Research data and the administrative records accompanying research projects should also be archived. Research data is a legitimate product of research and must be cited as such adhering to scholarly norms; re-used data must be explicitly traceable and original sources acknowledged.\\n5.2.8 All research projects, regardless of funding, will be accompanied by a Data Management Plan (DMP) that addresses how data will be captured, stored, accessed, secured and archived or disposed of. Each DMP must be appropriately costed into the proposal, including resources (for example, staff time, research data storage).\\n\\n5.2.9 All published outputs based on data generated by researchers should include a data access statement as standard. This is now a requirement by most funders, including UKRI.\\n\\n5.2.10 The University of Bradford will provide infrastructure and support for the safe storage of research data, as well as training for researchers at all levels that covers data security in line with current legislation, and data management planning.\\n\\n5.2.11 In most cases research data and documentation relating to the development and administration of research projects should be kept for a minimum of ten years after the end of the project. Some medical research has longer retention requirements detailed in the Document Retention and Disposal Policy.\\n\\n5.2.12 The fabrication, falsification, misrepresentation of data; plagiarism or failure to exercise due care in following out responsibilities relating to the collection and storage of data is considered to be research misconduct, and should be reported in line with the Research Misconduct Policy.\",\n",
       " 'The following terms used in this policy framework can be defined as follows:\\n\\nResearch data – “the evidence that underpins the answer to the research question, and can be used to validate findings regardless of its form (e.g. print, digital, or physical). These might be quantitative information or qualitative statements collected by researchers [staff, students or those supporting research] in the course of their work by experimentation, observation, modelling, interview or other methods, or information derived from existing evidence. Data may be raw or primary (e.g. direct from measurement or collection) or derived from primary data for subsequent analysis or interpretation (e.g. cleaned up or as an extract from a larger data set), or derived from existing sources where the rights may be held by others.”[1]\\n\\nManual research records – manual research records are any non-electronic documents and materials, regardless of format, which facilitate the research activities carried out by the University. This can include both the data underpinning research as well as records relating to research quality, standards and governance; research project development and management; and research commercialization. See section 4 of the Statement of Records Management Practice and Master Records Retention Schedule for details of the specific kinds of records which fall under these categories along with their respective retention periods.\\n\\nResearch staff and students - research staff are individuals undertaking academic research either in direct employment of the University or under formal agreement with the University in another capacity (e.g. retired staff) regardless of where that research is taking place, whether in Cambridge or elsewhere; research students are individuals who are undertaking academic research at the University in pursuit of a postgraduate degree or other award.\\n\\nActive data – “Research data files that are in the process of continuous change and/or development. Files containing this data are accessed, amended and/or updated as new data is gathered and/or processed. Some datasets may never be ‘finished’. A ‘snapshot’ of active research data can be archived to create a version that is fixed and can be cited.”[2]\\n\\nData Management Plan – a plan that outlines how data will be managed from the point of collection at the start of a research project all the way through to what will happen to the data once the project finishes. Typically a data management plan (DMP) will cover areas such as collection strategy, backup and storage of data, ethical/legal requirements related to data, data sharing and data archiving.\\n\\nMetadata – information that describes significant aspects of a dataset. For example, this may include authors, title, date of publication, unique identifier, a description of what the dataset contains and licence. This provides other researchers with the information needed to understand and reuse the dataset as well as making the dataset more findable\\n\\n## Principles',\n",
       " '2.2 Rights to research data\\n\\n2.2.1 Rights to research data must be clarified at the start of research projects. Unless legislation states otherwise, or agreements have been made to determine otherwise, the following is the default at UCPH:\\n\\na. In accordance with the general rules of copyright during employment, researchers hold the copyright to books and articles they publish as a result of research projects carried out at UCPH.\\nb. UCPH holds the copyright to software created by employees during the performance of their work.\\nc. UCPH holds the rights to research data in the shape of physical objects collected by researchers during their employment at UCPH, such as biological and geological samples, notebooks, paper interviews and books. These objects may not be removed without permission.\\nd. A copy of digital data sets and associated metadata must remain at UCPH when employment ceases. As a minimum, this applies to data sets underlying publications.\\ne. In accordance with the Danish Act on Inventions at Public Research Institutions, UCPH has the right to acquire researchers’ inventions and to ask researchers to postpone publication of such inventions for a short time period.\\n\\nIn addition, the following should be clarified:\\n\\nf. To what extent research data can be accessed in the project. For example, in projects involving personal data, it must be clarified to what extent rules of data confidentiality impose limits on data access, and how these limits will be upheld.\\ng. Who can access and manage the research data, and within which timeframe.\\nh. When and to what extent research data may be used for other purposes, for example in other research projects. It should be determined what rules apply if a project member leaves the project and/or UCPH.\\ni. Whether research data can be shared after project end, and if so, what the terms of data reuse by others will be.\\nj. Intellectual property rights, including whether the research project makes use of material that interferes with the rights of others, and how the necessary approvals should be obtained to clear these rights.\\nk. The legislation, policies or agreements governing the above, including whether there are special loyalty or confidentiality obligations.\\nl. Any research data management requirements by research funders, partner organisations, etc.\\n\\n2.2.2 The University’s Tech Transfer Office must be involved as early as possible in the negotiation of all third-party contracts containing provisions on intellectual property rights, such as non-disclosure agreements, material transfer agreements and collaboration agreements. Patentable inventions must be reported to the Tech Transfer Office in accordance with the Act on Inventions at Public Research Institutions.',\n",
       " '2.7 Long term preservation\\n\\n2.7.1 Appropriate arrangements for the long-term preservation of digital data, physical material and associated metadata must be made, adhering to legislation and/or agreements. This should include:\\n\\na. Deciding which research data will be preserved. As a minimum, data sets underlying published research results must be preserved so that any objections or criticisms can be addressed.\\nb. Deciding how long research data will be preserved. Data sets underlying research publications should be retained for at least five years after project completion or date of publication, whichever comes last.\\nc. Choosing a format and location in which research data should be preserved, and deciding what metadata should be associated with the preserved data and material.\\nd. Deleting/destructing research data if legislation or agreements exclude preservation, or when researchers and their managers determine that preservation is not required (for example when research data can easily be reproduced) or not possible (for example when research data are too costly to store or when material quality will deteriorate over time).\\ne. Assigning a person, persons or role(s) responsible for the research data after project end. Responsibilities include safeguarding the long-term integrity of data sets.\\nf. Determining rights, for example, of access to and use of preserved data sets.\\n\\n2.7.2 A copy of data sets and associated metadata must remain at UCPH after project end and/or when employment with the University ceases, in a way in which they are accessible to research managers and understandable for research managers and peers, unless legislation or agreements determine otherwise. As a minimum, this applies to data sets underlying publications. Responsibilities for and rights to these data sets must be agreed upon.\\n\\n2.7.3 Digital research data sets must be registered at project end if the research falls within the scope of the Executive Order on the Registration of Digital Research Data created by State Authorities, so that the Danish National Archives can assess the data sets’ potential for longterm preservation. The National Archives may subsequently request a copy of the data to be transferred to the archives. Data in these projects can only be destructed if the National Archives issue a disposal provision after their assessment.\\n\\n2.7.4 Personal data can only be preserved\\na. if anonymised\\nb. at the Danish National Archives\\nc. when there is a legal basis for the long term preservation of personal data in a secure database, biobank or other collection for research purposes.\\n\\n2.7.5 A plan for research data preservation and/or destruction must be developed, in alignment with legislation, (local) guidelines and agreements (if any), and the continued need for preservation should be reviewed on a regular basis.',\n",

       " '1. Policy Statement Principles\\n\\n1.1. The University advocates the highest standards in the management, re-use and open accessibility of Research Data and subscribes to the Research Councils Common Principles on Data Policy and the Concordat on Open Research Data.\\n\\n1.2. The privacy, confidentiality and other legitimate interests of any participants involved in the gathering of Research Data must remain protected at all times.\\n\\n1.3. Where appropriate, and adhering to item 1.2, Research Data should be made openly accessible for access and re-use by others.\\n\\n1.4. Research Data sets that are of a sensitive nature2 are not exempt from this policy by default, but may lie outwith this policy where restrictions on data use apply. Prior to commencing research, informed consent (including consent for data sharing) should be gathered, and plans for data anonymisation and access restriction should be made.\\n\\n1.5. Research that is commercially funded, including clinical research sponsored3 by the University of Dundee, will lie outwith this policy only if restrictions on data use apply. Where research is jointly funded by commercial and non-commercial funders, appropriate collaboration agreements must be put in place to define ownership of the Research Data and ensure compliance with the data sharing requirements of the noncommercial funder(s).\\n\\n1.6. The primary grant holder (Principal Investigator) is responsible for Research Data management and planning throughout their research project or programme. The most senior researcher associated with a project at the University of Dundee holds responsibility for the data stewardship for all Research Data relating to that project. In the absence of the senior researcher, responsibility for the data stewardship will transfer upward to the Dean of School.\\n\\n1.7. New research projects must include research data management plans that cover items such as: data capture, management, integrity, confidentiality, retention, sharing and publication. Any specific funding body, ethical, legal or School level requirements should be taken into account in the development of data management plans.\\n\\n1.8. Where there is a need to establish proprietary rights to protect the intellectual property of the University, Principal Investigators should discuss the intention to place Research Data in the public domain with Research & Innovation Services (RIS) before doing so. Every effort should be made to ensure that the timeframe to establish such rights is kept to a minimum.\\n\\n1.9. All research data gathered by students during the course of their study are the responsibility of the supervising staff member to manage in accordance with the requirements of this policy.\\n\\n1.10. The Library & Learning Centre (LLC) will provide support, guidance and information on appropriate research data management activities, including planning for funding applications, availability of internal and external research data repositories, licensing of datasets and allocation of persistent identifiers for datasets.',\n",
       " '2. Storage and Accessibility\\n\\n2.1. All Research Data of potential current or future interest, or that which substantiates published research findings, should be assessed by the Principal Investigator for deposition in an appropriate external or University led research data repository.\\n\\n2.2. The associated costs of data management, analytics, archiving and sharing should be recovered from funders in the grant application, where funder’s policies permit.\\n\\n2.3. Data must be stored securely, with appropriate measures taken to minimize the risk of unauthorised access, loss, destruction or theft.\\n\\n2.4. Where personal data sets are being used in research they shall be used in a manner compliant with the applicable data protection legislation4, or any statutory modification or re-enactment thereof. In particular:\\n\\nOnly the absolute minimum of personal data necessary shall be processed for any project\\nThe basis for lawful use of personal data shall be documented\\nEvery research participant shall be given information on the project and the use of each individual participant’s information shall meet transparency\\nrequirements.\\n\\n2.5. A central record of known datasets deposited in public access repositories, or curated by Schools, will be maintained by the LLC. Any Research Data to be deposited with external services, such as Research Council or international repositories, should therefore be made known to the LLC for recording in the University’s research information system (discovery@dundee.ac.uk). The University will ensure data continues to be discoverable and compliant with funder mandates.\\n\\n2.6. Published research results should always include information on how to access supporting data. The LLC will provide a persistent and unique identifier for datasets (DOI) where required.\\n\\n2.7. The University of Dundee will respect the requirements and policies of existing and future partnerships with third parties involved in the storage and safeguarding of Research Data. NHS and clinical trial data may be subject to additional governance as specified by the R&D Director, TASC, NHS Tayside (see TASC Publication Policy).\\n\\n2.8. The length of time data is stored for should be determined as part of the Research Data management planning for the project, and should adhere to any particular funding body’s requirements and any additional conditions or practices within the field. The Concordat on Open Data states “data underlying publications should be retained for 10 years from the date of any publication which fundamentally relies on the data, unless specified otherwise by the funder of the research.”\\n\\n2.9. Data are to be made openly available as soon as possible, and typically on publication of results. Embargo periods are permitted, but should adhere to any particular funding\\n\\nbody’s requirements and any additional conditions or practices within the field. It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator to adhere to funder requirements for data publishing and, where necessary, to negotiate an extension to restrictions on placing data in the public domain.\\n\\n2.10. Where data are published, the Principal Investigator is required to select an appropriate license under which their data will be made available and to ensure that the license permits sharing and re-use in accordance with their funder’s mandate and the terms and conditions of this policy. Guidance is available from University support services (see item 1.10 above). Electronic data published by the University Repository will be catalogued using structured metadata which includes details of licensing and a robust persistent digital object identifier (DOI).\\n\\n2.11. The University of Dundee retains the rights to re-use Research Data or make it openly available for others to re-use. Exclusive rights to re-use or publish Research Data should not therefore be granted to any third party, including commercial publishers, without prior discussion with RIS (paragraph 1.8 refers).\\n\\n2.12. The University of Dundee retains the intellectual property rights of the Research Data. Principal Investigators are entitled to be the first publishers of the data they have generated and have the right to be identified and credited as the creator. Original copies of data must be retained. Duplicate copies of data may be taken with permission of the PI or Dean where the re-use of the data are acceptable, as defined by this policy.\\n\\n2.13. All clinical trials sponsored by the University of Dundee must be registered on an appropriate publicly accessible research register within 6 weeks of first participant recruitment in the UK. Summary results data from clinical trials must be made publicly accessible in an appropriate format within 12 months from trial completion (for further details see the TASC Publication Policy).',\n",

From new students to experienced researchers, ensuring that research materials are well managed throughout the research project, and beyond, enables UEA’s research to have the greatest possible reach and benefit to the academic community and the wider public.\\n\\n### Review\\n\\nThis Research Data Management Policy sets out the University’s position on the management of Research Data.

This policy and the associated guidance2 expand on this with respect to Research Data. As such, this policy applies to all UEA Researchers. It is the responsibility of heads of Faculties, Schools and Units to ensure their staff and students are aware of and comply with these policies.\\n\\n### Definitions\\n\\nResearch Data  There is no single definition of what constitutes Research Data. For the purposes of the University’s Research Data Management Policy and the associated Procedures and Guidelines, the following definition, from the Concordat on Open Research Data3, provides an indication of the scope: “Research data are the evidence that underpins the answer to the research question, and can be used to validate findings regardless of its form (e.g. print, digital, or physical). These might be quantitative information or qualitative statements collected by researchers in the course of their work by experimentation, observation, modelling, interview or other methods, or information derived from existing evidence. Data may be raw or primary (e.g. direct from measurement or collection) or derived from primary data for subsequent analysis or interpretation (e.g. cleaned up or as an extract from a larger data set), or derived from existing sources where the rights may be held by others. Data may be defined as ‘relational’ or ‘functional’ components of research, thus signalling that their identification and value lies in whether and how researchers use them as evidence for claims.”\\n\\nA definition of the research data should be provided in the Data Management Plan.4 Examples of research data include (but are not limited to): documents, spreadsheets, databases, field notebooks, diaries, audio- and video recordings, photographs and images, transcripts, survey responses, protein or genetic sequences, algorithms, computer code, workflows, standard operating procedures and protocols. All data gathered and generated as a result of the research, and not just analysed data that underpin a research output, are in scope. The mechanisms for retention and archive will necessarily differ according to the format of the data, or due to disciplinary norms. Where data are obtained from a third party, any adjustments to that base data set on which research relies should be included within the data generated as a result of the research.\\n\\nrchers The term Researchers is used to refer collectively to the following groups of people:\\n\\nAcademic, research and relevant support staff employed by the University, and other individuals carrying out research at, or on behalf of, the University Students undertaking research (including undergraduate research projects) and their supervisors\\nAny persons with honorary positions conducting research within, or on behalf of, the University.\\n\\nIn this document, the following verbal forms are used:\\n\\n“shall” and “must” indicated a requirement;\\n“should” indicates a recommendation;\\n“may” indicates a permission;\\n“can” indicates a possibility or a capability.\\n\\n## Principles\\n\\nThe University’s policy is based on the following principles:',\n",
       " 'Research Data Policy\\n\\nThe university takes the definition of research data as:\\n\\n“evidence that underpins the answer to the research question, and can be used to validate findings regardless of its form (e.g. print, digital, or physical) … [including] statistics, collections of digital images, sound recordings, transcripts of interviews, survey data and fieldwork observations with appropriate annotations, an interpretation, an artwork, archives, found objects, published texts or a manuscript” (The Concordat Working Group, 2016).\\n\\nMaking research data accessible for reuse and to increase its potential impact is a key objective for UK Research Councils, and they have played a leading role in the development of the Concordat on Open Research Data on which this policy document is based.  Other funding agencies such as UK Government Departments, EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation and various charitable foundations have developed policies to encourage more open access to research data.  In addition, journal publishers are advocating that access to the underlying data should be an intrinsic part of the academic publishing process.\\n\\nIn accordance with the principles laid out in the Concordat on Open Research Data, all appropriate data generated by projects supported or led by University of Greenwich staff, as appropriate, shall be made openly available with as few restrictions as possible. When legally, commercially and ethically appropriate, data will be uploaded to an appropriate funder repository2 in a timely and responsible manner. If an appropriate data repository cannot be found, datasets must be uploaded to GALA.\\n\\nData should be retained for a minimum of 10 years from the end of the project, or from publication of an output relating to the research, whichever comes first. Where funder or other legal requirements specify a longer retention period, this should be observed.\\n\\nResearch data that must be retained after project completion include:\\n\\na. Data that support research findings3,\\nb. Data that are of potential long-term value,\\nc. Data that support patent applications\\nd. Data which are subject to other legal requirements for data retention.\\n\\nResearchers should avoid retaining data solely using methods that might not persist for 10 years, such as on project websites, personal computing equipment or in formats limited to proprietary software. Researchers are permitted to have an embargo period on their research data to complete their work, publications, or intellectual property filing on that data, before release.\\n\\nDatasets hosted in funder or subject repositories must still be registered with the university, either during the closure of a project, or by contacting researchsupport@gre.ac.uk.\\n\\nAll research proposals must include a data management plan, regardless of whether it is required by the funder. Researchers should also ensure that research proposals include a budget, where applicable, to cover the costs of managing research data in both the short and longer term.\\n\\nAll data handlers and processors have responsibilities for the data collected, created, stored, and/or preserved. However, the Principal Investigator (PI) may have overall responsibility for the implementation of data management plans of a research project, in order to ensure that research data are available for access and re-use where appropriate and with the necessary safeguards. All of this must be undertaken in line with the university’s relevant policies4.\\n\\nThe university recognises its responsibility to ensure researchers are supported throughout the research process to ensure full compliance with funder data policies and contractual requirements on research data management. The university commits to support academic and research staff in choosing a repository as well as writing data management plans, selecting and appraising data for storage, and in understanding and meeting any other requirements.\\n\\nReferences and endnotes\\nConcordat Working Group.

       " 'Research data management throughout the whole research process\\n\\n### (1) Planning research and data needs\\n\\nIn planning research and the methodology to be used, it is important to consider the ethical as well as practical implications of how the research is to be conducted and data collected and managed, especially the requirement to anonymise the data as soon as practical. Awareness of the requirements should influence the design of the methodology. The planning of the research must include the need to consider ethical issues and the requirements relating to data management. The resulting research data management plan should be registered via this link.\\n\\n### (2) Data collection\\n\\nData is to be collected in an ethically responsible way. During the data collection process, there needs to be security of data already collected. For example, questionnaires should be securely stored. Audio or video recordings should be transferred to a password protected device as soon as possible. Initially data is likely to be re-identifiable, with the identification kept separate to actual data; however, it should be anonymised as soon as practical. Ideally, data is stored directly onto the Y: drive.\\n\\nDuring field work, data can be stored initially on a personal computer or laptop if there is no internet possibility. The data will need to be uploaded onto the Y-drive regularly (depending on the circumstances). It is recommended to also upload on an encrypted external hard-drive and then delete data from the laptop. It is also good practice to encrypt the partition of the harddrive reserved for storing personal data. In case of loss or stolen laptop/devices this needs to be reported as a data breach via cert@security.rug.nl.\\n\\n### (3) Access to data during the research process\\n\\nExcept for legitimate requests relating to scientific integrity concerns, it is generally advisable to restrict access to data to the researcher and supervisor(s) only, and restrict access until such time that the researcher is completely sure that original research data have been verified (for coding accuracy) and maybe until all publications being produced from the data are finalised. However, all research participants have a right to see any data that pertains directly to them, and can request that data which refer to the research participant will be removed from the data set where this is feasible.\\n\\n### (4) Storage of data\\n\\nIn line with the Netherlands Code of Conduct for Scientific Practice and the policies of the University of Groningen, empirical data is required to be stored safely. In anticipation of a RUG wide repository, the Faculty manages a Research Data Repository (Y-drive). The FSS repository is in a digital form where every researcher has their own folder identified with a P-number. Researchers will be required to provide their data in an appropriate form (including anonymization). The function of the Faculty repository is to enable access only under certain specific circumstances relating to the need to be able to verify the data. The URSI Director in consultation with the researcher will be responsible for assessing any request to access data in the repository. Consistent with the prevailing requirements, data will be stored in this repository for a fixed period of 10 years. After 10 years, data that has not been made open access will be destroyed, though if needed data can be stored longer. Note that all data must be fully anonymised as soon as practical to do so.\\n\\nNote that the Faculty data repository is not an open access facility, it is merely established to allow scrutiny in relation to legitimate concerns about scientific integrity. To comply with the open access expectation, researchers might need to identify an appropriate open access data provider, such as might be provided by a scientific institute or a journal publisher.\\n\\n### (5) Cybersecurity\\n\\nA cyber security incident is a situation involving a breach of the security of the UG’s information systems and the data stored within them. A data breach is a situation in which the security of personal data has been compromised.\\n\\nExamples of a cyber-security incidents and data breaches are:\\n\\nA laptop gets stolen or is lost.\\nA data set containing personal information has been accidentally shared with a number of people who should not have access.\\nA couple of signed consent forms have been left in public transport.\\n\\nAlways report cyber security incidents (whether these are confirmed or suspected) and data breaches to the Computer Emergency Response Team via cert@security.rug.nl.

       " 'Using personal data\\n\\nIn some cases researchers process personal data in their research. Researchers are therefore expected to understand the basic principles of the General Data Protection Regulation.\\n\\n### (1) The General Data Protection Regulation\\n\\nSince May 2018, all member states of the European Economic Area share the same data protection law: the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This law governs the processing of personal data both inside and outside the EU/EEA when this is done by organisations based in one of the member states. This law also applies to research activities by universities, even when these take place in non-member states.\\n\\nPersonal data in the GDPR are defined as “any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person” (Art. 4.1).  A ‘natural’ person means a living person. In the GDPR, there is no distinction between public and private/confidential data, only between personal and non-personal data. All personal data should be treated as confidential.\\n\\nIn case of secondary data, the researcher should check if consent is needed from the secondary data source. Also when using existing data, it is important that the respondent gave consent for these data to be re-used. (see  \\n\\nExamples of ‘identifiers’ are names, an identification number, contact details, location data, dates and times of meetings, IP-addresses, ethnicity, religious identity, or a combination of data that allows for a person to be identified as a unique individual. ‘Processing’ should be understood as any operation with data: gathering, viewing, analyzing, storing, sharing etc.\\n\\nThe GDPR sets constraints to what is possible with personal data and requires us to properly secure the data.\\n\\nWe expect staff:\\n\\nto take notice of the general principles of the GDPR. A special UG website has been created to inform everyone in the UG about the basic principles; to take standard precautions when handling data. Among these are e.g. creating strong passwords, anonymisation when possible, working on secure devices and working on the university’s network as much as possible. See the UG’s website for a general overview of the standard measures that you can take; in case of handling personal data in research to be demonstrably compliant, by creating and registering a data management plan and applying for approval of the Research Ethics Committee and by checking whether a DPIA is necessary.\\n\\n### (2) Demonstrating compliance\\n\\nA central principle in the GDPR is ‘accountability’. If researchers are planning to process personal data in their research, then they need to be able to demonstrate compliance with the GDPR. This means that researchers are expected to design their research in such a way that the private lives of participants as well as their rights and freedoms are minimally impacted, and that researchers can show how this will be achieved.\\n\\nResearchers are therefore expected to anonymise data when possible, design their research in a privacy-friendly way, think about appropriate technical and organizational measures, register their research proposal and follow the existing ethics approval procedure.\\n\\n### (3) Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)\\n\\nApart from a research data management plan, research involving living human beings may also require doing a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA).\\n\\nA full DPIA report:\\n\\nmaps the data privacy risks in the project;\\nassesses these risks; and\\ndefines protection measures to eliminate or mitigate the risks.\\n\\nPerforming a DPIA is legally required when data processing activities1 are likely to ‘result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons’ (art. 35 GDPR).\\n\\nAn exhaustive list of potential high-risk scenario’s cannot be given in advance, but in general, a DPIA may be necessary when researchers are planning to include sensitive personal data into their dataset (such as health data or ethnicity); when they involve innovative technologies (and companies) that process data; research with location data, GPS tracking of individuals or research that uses ‘profiling techniques’; when people may be in a vulnerable position (children, or people  who face imbalances in power relationships; or when they systematic monitor of publicly accessible areas without informing people (‘covert observation’). Projects that involve many different partners with different (non-academic) aims  may also be subjected to a DPIA.\\n\\nIf a DPIA is required, then this should take place before data processing starts. A DPIA can be supported by the Digital Competence Center and performed by a team of people involved in the project in question, including, for example, a subject expert, a privacy officer, an IT expert, and a student or staff member involved. The process may be timeconsuming. Researchers are therefore advised to contact the DCC as soon as possible (see section 20 on support).\\n\\nIf a DPIA has already been performed on a similar research project at our, or at a different research university in the EU/EEA zone, then this can also be used as a point of reference, provided that the data protection measures set out are demonstrably applied by the researcher.\\n\\nThe Privacy and Security Coordinator can advise whether a DPIA is necessary. The decision to do a DPIA is ultimately the responsibility of the Faculty Board.',\n",

This means that data or datasets should be archived in such a way that ideally the research results can be replicated. Metadata and data should be machine-readable in order to make it easy to find; anyone who finds the data should be able to know how they can be accessed; the data needs to interoperate with applications or workflows for analysis, storage and processing and, when there no objections the metadata and data should be welldescribed so that they can be replicated and/or combined in different settings.\\n\\nData Steward is an officer (at CIT/Library) who is responsible for managing and protecting an organization's data.

       " '3. Responsibilities of the researcher\\n\\n3.1 Principal Investigators (unless a defined role of data manager is assigned within the project group) are required to prepare a data management plan (DMP) which describes the data management life cycle for the data to be collected and processed by a research project. DMPs are usually required as part of research proposals for external funding and the University encourages similar best practice for internally funded projects. DMPs should include information on:\\n\\nthe handling of research data during and after the end of the project\\nwhat data will be collected, processed and/or generated\\nwhich methodology and standards will be applied\\nwhether data will be shared/made open access and\\nhow data will be curated and preserved (including after the end of the project)\\n\\n3.2 Principal Investigators (unless a defined role of data manager is assigned within the project group) hold day-to-day responsibility for the effective management of research data generated within or obtained from their research, including by their research groups. This shall include understanding and complying with the requirements of any relevant contract with or grant to the University that includes provisions regarding the ownership, preservation and dissemination of research data.\\n\\n3.3 Researchers will protect confidential, personal and sensitive personal research data in accordance with legal and ethical requirements related to the research they conduct.\\n\\n3.4 Researchers will make every reasonable effort to keep an accurate and comprehensive record of their research, including documenting clear procedures for the collection, storage, use, reuse, access and retention or deletion of the research data associated with their records. Where appropriate, this should include defining and documenting protocols and responsibilities in collaborative research projects.\\n\\n3.4 Researchers will make every reasonable effort to recognise Intellectual Property arising from their research activities and manage that Intellectual Property according to any funder requirements or contractual obligations.\\n\\n3.5 Researchers will preserve and provide appropriate access to their research data supporting outputs after the end of their project for as long as it has continuing value, in accordance with legal and funder requirements and paying due regard to discipline norms and cost. Notwithstanding, the minimum retention period for research data and records is ten years after publication or public release of the work of the research. School Research Ethics Committees can consider and approve proposals from PIs to retain data for shorter periods of time where reasoned arguments are provided e.g. where individuals participating in the research may be put at significant risk of identification.\\n\\n3.6 Researchers should deposit their data in an appropriate data repository along with sufficient descriptive metadata (a data record) to ensure that it can be found and understood. Where academic staff deposit data somewhere other than the University’s institutional data repository (the University of Huddersfield Research Portal), a metadata record should still be created in the portal which describes and points to the data.\\n\\n3.7 Published papers which rely on data generated by the authors should include a data access statement even where there are no data associated with the article or the data are inaccessible, In line with UKRI policy on Open access. Authors should also apply good data citation principles and formally cite data which has directly informed the conclusions drawn in their papers.\\n\\n3.8 Researchers are responsible for agreeing arrangements (with their Research Centre Director or nominee) as to where their research data will be stored and who will have access to this after they leave (or retire from) the University.  The researcher’s department or School reserves the right to retain a copy of the data for an appropriate period to ensure compliance with any legal or regulatory responsibilities, and/or research grant or contractual requirements.\\n\\n3.9 Researchers can obtain advice and support from the Research Data Management Team (rdm@hud.ac.uk) team.',\n",
       " '4. Definitions\\n\\nFor the purposes of this policy, the following terms are defined:\\n\\n4.1 Research: Broadly, this is an activity that leads to new insights and knowledge. There are a number of definitions for research, one being the Frascati definition that states “Research and experimental development (R&D) comprise creative work undertaken on a systematic basis in order to increase the stock of knowledge, including knowledge of humankind, culture and society, and the use of this stock of knowledge to devise new applications.”\\n\\n4.2 Researcher: Any individual who conducts research under the auspices of the University.\\n\\n4.3 Principal Investigator (PI): A researcher with overall responsibility for a research project. In clinical research where a project has a Chief Investigator (CI) as well as one or more Principal Investigators (PI), the CI has overall responsibility for the research project while each PI has responsibility for an individual recruiting site.\\n\\n4.4 Research Data: The University adopts the definition laid out in the Concordat on Open Research Data (p.3) which states that “research data are the evidence that underpins the answer to the research question, and can be used to validate findings regardless of form (e.g. print, digital, or physical)1. These might be quantitative information or qualitative statements collected by researchers in the course of their work by experimentation, observation, modelling, interview or other methods, or information derived from existing evidence. Data may be raw or primary (e.g. direct from measurement or collection) or derived from primary data for subsequent analysis or interpretation (e.g. cleaned up or as an extract from a larger data set), or derived from existing sources where the rights may be held by others.”\\n\\n4.5 Sponsor: A body that guarantees and oversees a research project or clinical trial, ensuring that there are proper arrangements in place to initiate, manage, monitor and finance a study. A Sponsor can be external to the University.\\n\\n4.6 Clinical Trials Unit (CTU): An academic specialised research unit with the purpose of designing, conducting, analysing, and publishing clinical trials and other studies. At Liverpool Clinical Trials Centre, the Director of the CTU is typically the data custodian and is responsible for ensuring the proper handling and security of trial data.\\n\\n4.7 Data Controller: The organisation responsible for data security and meeting data protection requirements.\\n\\n4.8 There are three main states of research data:\\n\\nActive data: “Live” project data regularly accessed and/or analysed as part of a research project.\\n\\nArchive data: End-of-project or finished data. These data are prepared for long-term preservation and archived for legal, regulatory, or contractual purposes. They may contain sensitive or personal information and might not be openly available. Some archive data may also be shared data.\\n\\nShared data: Research data that are made available for reuse. This may include restrictions or conditions of access and reuse.',\n",
       " '5.3 Responsibilities of researchers\\n\\nFor associated guidance and resources, see Section 6. Key expectations and guidance.\\n\\n5.3.1 Researchers are responsible for familiarising themselves with the requirements of this Research Data Management Policy and any relevant legislation, policies, or contracts from research funders and other stakeholders.\\n\\n5.3.2 Individual researchers, or, in the case of collaborative research projects the Principal Investigator (PI) or Clinical Investigator (CI), are responsible for ensuring data management adheres to all relevant policies including complying with legal, ethical, or regulatory frameworks governing the processing and safeguarding of personal and sensitive research data. In the case of Clinical Trials or Sponsored research, the Sponsor will delegate the task of data management to the CI, and will retain oversight of the study. Relevant policies include, but are not limited to, the University’s Policy on Research Integrity, Data Protection Policy, Information Security Policy, IT Acceptable Use Policy and the Freedom of Information Policy.\\n\\n5.3.3 The PI has overall day-to-day responsibility for the effective management of research data and research related records including delegating responsibility for data management to co-investigators or other project members where appropriate and ensuring all project members are informed of data-related decisions. For Clinical Trials or Sponsored research, the Sponsor is responsible for delegating data management tasks.\\n\\n5.3.4 Researchers are responsible for the effective management of research data and research related records and making appropriate decisions about data collection, processing, storage, safeguarding, archiving, and data sharing in their field. An accurate and comprehensive record of the research should be kept including documenting standards, protocols, and responsibilities.\\n\\n5.3.5 Researchers are responsible for ensuring all required governance approvals including ethical approval and sponsorship is obtained for applicable research projects before any\\n\\ndata collection has begun in line with relevant policies including the University’s Policy on Research Ethics, Human Materials Research Policy, Clinical Trials of Investigational Medicinal Products Sponsored by the University and the Sponsorship of Research Policy.\\n\\n5.3.6 Researchers are responsible for making appropriate appraisal decisions for the retention, transference of ownership, or destruction of research data at the end of the project and/or when they leave the University. These decisions should consider legal or funder requirements as well as the University’s Information Management Policy and Records Retention Schedule.\\n\\n5.3.7 In the case of postgraduate research (PGR) projects, overall responsibility for ensuring data are managed in line with relevant policies lies with the PGR’s supervisor. PGRs are responsible for the day-to-day management of the data including writing the ethics application (where applicable) which should be shared with their academic supervisor or PI. PGRs and their supervisors are also subject to the PGR Code of Practice.\\n\\n5.3.8 In the case of undergraduate and postgraduate taught course (PGT) students undertaking research, the responsibility lies with the student’s supervisor or PI for ensuring resulting research data are managed in line with relevant policies, including the University’s Policy on Research Ethics, Information Security Policy, IT Acceptable Use Policy, and the Programme Terms and Conditions. Data acquired in undergraduate or taught postgraduate projects will not normally be retained. It is the responsibility of the PI or supervisor to ensure that any research data collected during such projects is deleted at the end of the project except in exceptional circumstances including but not limited to where legal or regulatory requirements are in place or research findings are included in published outputs.',\n",
       " 'Data preservation\\n\\nHow will you ensure the long-term storage and preservation of data?\\n\\nOutline how you will ensure data is stored long-term: state where you will deposit your data (your nominated data centre or repository), and how long it will be preserved for. Some research funders and regulators specify how long data should be retained for. Where this is articulated, you should describe how you will meet this requirement (i.e., selecting an appropriate repository that guarantees preservation for a minimum period). In all other circumstances, the University expects data to be retained for a minimum of 7 years. Outline what data you will retain. Not all data will be suitable for retention, but some data will be mandated for retention. Identify any data repository (- ies) that are, or will be, entrusted with storing, curating and/or sharing data from your study, where they exist for particular disciplinary domains or data types. Most funders recommend that data underpinning\\n\\nresearch outputs should be deposited in an established data repository that specialises in retention, preservation, and publication of data. When choosing a repository, you should consider:\\n\\nAre the repository’s terms and conditions acceptable and do they align with funder requirements?\\nWill support for access or curation be needed from the data centre that exceeds the norm, and has this been planned for/ costed?\\nWhere is your data going to be stored and does this meet legal or ethical obligations such as compliance with the GDPR?\\nWill your dataset be given a permanent identifier, such as a DOI, so that the link to your data will stay the same even if the web URLs change?\\nIs the repository used by researchers in your discipline? Does the repository already have a good reputation in your field and is it recommended by your funder or your journal?\\nDoes the repository allow you to describe your data sufficiently, so it is easy to find and easy to cite?\\uf020\\nIs the repository established and well-funded so that you can rely on it still preserving your data in 10 years’ time?\\uf020\\nIn your data management plan, you should state where your data will be deposited for long term preservation, and identify any costs associated with storing and making your research data available online.\\n\\nIf a data centre exists for your specific discipline, then it is usually recommended to choose this option. Some funders mandate deposit in a specific repository, for example, ESRC data must be deposited with the UK Data Service within 3 months of project end; NERC has a network of environmental data centres to provide a similar job for research it funds. See the NERC Data Centre or the ESRC-supported UK Data Service. You can check if a repository exists for your discipline by searching the re3data.org Registry of research data repositories.\\n\\nIf there is no established data repository available for your discipline or funder, the University of Nottingham also has its own Research Data repository, which issues a DOI (Digital Object Identifier) for each dataset deposited so that it can be easily cited. The repository can be used to either deposit a closed (private) dataset, publish data openly, or under controlled access restrictions. The repository will provide access to your data in line with your funder\\'s retention period.\\n\\nSample text: “All anonymised research data created by the project will be deposited in the UoN research data archive (  UoN will retain and preserve research data in line with UoN and [insert your funder\\'s name] requirements for a minimum of 7 [or insert your funder\\'s minimum retention requirement if longer] years, but data will be retained for longer periods of time where it is of continual value to users\\n\\nSample text: \"All research data created by the project will be deposited in [name of the data repository] who will store and maintain the data on our behalf in line with our funder\\'s requirements. There is no cost for this service.\"',\n",
       " 'Data sharing, publication and access\\n\\nHow will the data generated be shared and published?\\n\\nDescribe what data will be suitable for sharing and how this will be achieved (through a data repository, or a description of the data in a data journal). Indicate how potential new users (outside of your organisation) can find out about your data. Indicate whether the data will be deposited in and available from an identified community database, repository, archive or other infrastructure established to curate and share data. If the data will be suitable for controlled access, identify who makes or will make the decision on whether to supply the data to a potential new user. Indicate whether external users are (will be) bound by data sharing agreements, setting out their main responsibilities. If the data will not be suitable for sharing, justify why this is the case. If you do not wish to share the data for a limited, defined period of exclusive use of data for primary research, show how this restriction on sharing is based on simple, clear principles. What are the timescale/dependencies for when data will be accessible to others outside of your team? Summarize the principles of your current/intended policy. Indicate whether your policy or approach to data sharing is (or will be) published on your study website (or by other means).\\n\\nOutline the way(s) in which your data will be shared (e.g., DOI), and/or any justification for why this is not possible. How will data be shared, and what is its value to others? State the timeline for public release of data and the mechanism to achieve this. The preferred way to share data is by depositing it with data repositories who will either publish it openly online, or offer some form of controlled access. You can also publish a description of your dataset in a data journal. You will need to include a data access statement in published outputs or final reports referencing your DOI, or, where and how data can be accessed.\\n\\nWill the data be open, or will you charge to access it? Justify if charging.\\n\\nHow will you license the data?\\n\\nHow will you ensure that your data is Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Re-usable?\\n\\nState when you intend to share or release your data, including any planned embargo period and the justification for this. Some communities have established timeframes for releasing data. These disciplinary guidelines, if they exist, should be referenced in the DMP. State any restrictions or delays to sharing, with planned actions to limit such restrictions. For most funders, a limited and defined period of exclusive use is acceptable (embargoes). This may be for reasons such as to avoid compromising research results by premature sharing, or to allow for the filing of patent applications.\\n\\nIt is also acknowledged that not all data can or should be \\'open\\' and so publishing and sharing data may need to be restricted, for example:\\n\\nlegal requirements – if your data includes personal information subject to the Data\\nProtection Act 2018 and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\\nethical concerns – if your data includes personal or confidential data where no consent for sharing has been given.\\nlicence restrictions – if you are using data owned by third parties and don’t have the rights to share.\\uf020\\n\\nIf you believe your data will require controlled access state this here. Details of the managed access process should be provided, including if a Data Sharing Agreement will be completed for each data request. If you expect obstacles to sharing your data, explain which and the possible measures you can apply to overcome these. Make explicit mention of the planned procedures to handle consent for data sharing for data obtained from human participants, and/or how to anonymise data, to make sure that data can be made available and accessible for future scientific research.\\n\\nSample text: \" All data for which consent to share has been obtained will be shared via the University of Nottingham data archive under a CC-BY license. Any data which is deemed to be personally or commercially sensitive will assessed on a case-by-case basis to determine whether it can be shared. There will be no need to update the data past the project period. All published outputs will contain a Data Availability Statement including the datacite DOI that directs to the relevant data set. Data will be released at the same time as any published outputs underpinned by the data or by one year from the end of the project.\"\\n\\nSample text: \"The anonymised data (transcripts and questionnaires) will be deposited in the University of Nottingham data archive once all data has been gathered, anonymised, and cleansed [in line with the timelines mandated by my funder for the timely deposit of data]. In order to minimise any further risk of disclosure, we shall control access requests to any data containing personal information to ensure the confidentiality of our research participants. Access agreements will be written on request in conjunction with the Research Contracts Team.\"\\n\\nSample text: \"The existence, range, and nature of the project’s original data will be publicised via references in published outputs by including relevant dataset DOIs, as well as via conference presentations and materials produced during the project.\"\\n\\nSample text: \"Our data will be deposited in the University of Nottingham data archive.

       " 'Definitions\\n\\nFor the purpose of this Policy, these terms are defined as follows:\\n\\nA ‘Data Management Plan’ (DMP) typically states what research data are likely to be created as a result of certain research activities and outlines the plans for data collection, storage, processing, preservation, sharing/dissemination, and eventual (possible) destruction of such research data. A DMP might take the form of a stand-alone document or be part of a research funding application or research design protocol (for ethical review). It should be considered a living document, subject to necessary changes, for the duration of a project. For simple projects a DMP will likely be brief. For more complex projects it may act as an overview or index document for all the necessary DM processes.\\n\\nOpen Access’ (OA) means that research data are made available such that they can be accessed and used by the general public and other organisations, without cost to the user.\\n\\nThe ‘UoP Data Steward’ is the most senior University of Portsmouth Researcher (staff member) associated with the research data (but not necessarily responsible for the OA requirements).

The information regarding the novel DFG Code of Conduct in footnote 3 has been added editorially.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe University of Potsdam, as Brandenburg’s largest university, is oriented towards distinctive interdisciplinary research profiles in cooperation with a large number of non-university research institutions in the natural and human sciences, the humanities, and the social sciences. In many of these areas, data are an essential basis of scientific knowledge; since 2019, data-centric sciences have been designated as one of four focus areas for research at the University of Potsdam.\\n\\nResearch data can be the foundation for further research as well as the transfer of knowledge and technology, including for purposes beyond those for which the data were collected. Therefore, publishing and archiving research data serve not only for the replicability and verification of earlier results but also for the finding of new results. Recent developments in good scientific practice have given rise to new requirements regarding the handling of research data. Moreover, the digital transformation in academia confronts researchers and research support staff with challenges regarding capabilities and infrastructural prerequisites for research data management. Making data publishing and research data management a self-evident part of research practice will require cultural changes.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis policy governs the handling of data that is generated, reused, or processed as part of the research methods for research projects. This includes the methods and test procedures available as data, such as questionnaires or software. It also serves to implement the “Principles for Handling of Research Data” by the Alliance of Science Organisations in Germany1 and the “Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities” signed by the University of Potsdam in 20152.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis policy applies to all researchers and research support staff at the University of Potsdam. The University of Potsdam will publish recommendations on how researchers and research support staff can comply with the requirements of this policy.\\n\\n### I. Principles\\n\\n(1) The University of Potsdam is committed to free access to research data. Research data should be made available for reuse as openly as possible, unless interests worthy of protection predominate or legal requirements prevent their publication. Research data that constitute the basis of published results should be made accessible promptly and linked to the publication appropriately. Research data with high reuse potential should be published in a quality-assured manner regardless of their use for a text publication. In order to improve reproducibility and to acknowledge underlying academic achievements, reused data and research software should be cited.\\n\\n\\n\\n(2)\\t The University of Potsdam ensures the archiving of research data. Research data that constitute the basis of a text publication but are not themselves published are to be archived for at least 10 years using a suitable infrastructure. Storage of research data exclusively by the researchers themselves or the immediate deletion of the data are permissible only if interests worthy of protection predominate or legal requirements stipulate this, or in case no suitable infrastructure for archiving these data is available.\\n\\n(3) The University of Potsdam recognizes the preparation of research data for reuse and the development of reusable research software as academic achievements. The same applies to contributions to the advancement of discipline-specific good practice in the handling of research data and research software. The research output of the University of Potsdam includes quality-assured data and software publications that are recognized by the respective scientific community.\\n\\n\\n\\n(4)\\t All researchers are responsible for complying with good scientific practice regarding the handling of research data. The relevant discipline-specific guidelines by DFG review boards and academic associations on the handling of research data are to be taken into account. The following people bear special responsibility:',\n",
       " 'intellectual property rights (copyright and related rights as well as patent law and related commercial rights, including regulations regarding employee inventions).\\n\\n\\n\\n(3) Further binding regulations may result from agreements, e.g., in grant, cooperation, and license contracts. In particular, the requirements of funding bodies for the management, publishing, and archiving of research data must be met. Any restrictions on the openness and reusability of research data through contracts and other agreements that contravene the principles of this policy are to be avoided.\\n\\n\\n\\n### III.\\t Institutional Responsibility\\n\\n(1)\\t As part of its research data strategy, the University of Potsdam commits itself to create the technical and organizational preconditions that enable compliance with this policy.\\n(2)\\t The University of Potsdam initiates a cross-faculty discussion and development process on open science and the digital transformation in research, as well as on data handling competence training in teaching for degree courses and in postgraduate training.\\n(3)\\t The University of Potsdam supports declarations and initiatives at the state, federal, European, and international levels that promote free access to research data, the recognition of data and software publications as research output, good practice in research data management, and good conditions for data-intensive research.\\n(4)\\t The activities of the University of Potsdam in the field of research data take gender and diversity aspects into account.\\n\\n\\n\\n### IV. Validity\\n\\n(1)\\t This policy shall enter into force after the day of its publication in Amtliche Bekanntmachungen “Official Notices” of the University of Potsdam.\\n(2)\\t It will be reviewed together with the associated research data strategy of the University of Potsdam when necessary, but no later than in 2023.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Recommendations for the Handling of Research Data at the University of Potsdam\\n\\nNon-official translation of the recommendations adopted by Senate’s Commission for Research and Junior Academics (FNK) on June 26, 2019, duly noted by Senate on September 25, 2019, with changes adopted by FNK on October 9, 2019 to match the requirements of the novel DFG Code of Conduct Guidelines for Safeguarding Good Research Practice.\\n\\nThese recommendations specify and complement the Research Data Policy of University of Potsdam. They are aimed at all researchers and research support staff.\\n\\n### I. Working with Research Data\\n\\nThe requirements of good scientific practice regarding honest, methodologically correct, thorough, reliable, and replicable work through good documentation also apply to the handling of research data. Principle overarching elements of secure and well-documented work with research data are listed below. For the planning and structured documentation of these elements it is recommended to use data management plans (DMP) as instruments for project and quality management and to update them regularly. DMP can be created at the level of a project, a data-intensive research instrument, or a working group, as needed. In the case of projects which pose an exceptional burden on centrally-operated infrastructure, central facilities may require the submission of a DMP.',\n",
       " 'I. Working with Research Data\\n\\nThe requirements of good scientific practice regarding honest, methodologically correct, thorough, reliable, and replicable work through good documentation also apply to the handling of research data. Principle overarching elements of secure and well-documented work with research data are listed below. For the planning and structured documentation of these elements it is recommended to use data management plans (DMP) as instruments for project and quality management and to update them regularly. DMP can be created at the level of a project, a data-intensive research instrument, or a working group, as needed. In the case of projects which pose an exceptional burden on centrally-operated infrastructure, central facilities may require the submission of a DMP.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1. Purpose of the data. It is recommended to determine at an early stage which data will be published or archived and which data will continue to be stored by the researchers themselves. It is useful to define holding periods. Data that are no longer needed, nor worth publishing or archiving, should be deleted regularly. In particular, personal data are subject to the principle of storage limitation: storage is only permitted as long as strictly necessary for the respective purpose. Therefore, research data that contains personally identifyable information must be anonymized as soon as possible according to the research purpose.1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2. Intellectual property. Research data usually is not covered by copyright or related intellectual property rights, but in certain cases multiple rights may accrue to different persons. Ownership and usage rights of research data are therefore often unclear, which can limit its reuse. For each pro ject with multiple participants it is therefore recommended to document at an early stage which rights may have accrued to whom, the intention to publish the data, and the reciprocal granting of the relevant usage rights.\\n\\n3. Secure storage. Data loss is to be prevented through the use of suitable storage services or of storage media and appropriate backups. The use of storage services run by the scientific community is recommended; the use of local storage media and of commercial storage services as a private customer is discouraged. In many cases version-control is helpful. The necessary level of data security is to be ensured by appropriate technical and organizational measures, e.g. effective access restrictions and pseudonymization of personal data that cannot be fully anonymized.\\n\\n4. Documentation and use of standards. To make data reusable it is necessary to document the context in which the data was created and the tools used for data processing. For the sake of interoperability and long-term readability, the use of appropriate file formats is recommended with preference given to formats using open standards. To further reproducibility it is recommended to define and document conventions for fle names and folder hierarchies early on; to use suitable, and when possible subject-specific metadata standards; and to collect relevant metadata already during the research process.',\n",
       " 'II. Publication and Citation of Research Data\\n\\n\\n\\nThe rules of good scientific practice for publishing also apply to data and software publications. In particular, it is prohibited to withhold data that does not support the authors’ hypotheses, to fragment data and software publications with the aim of increasing the number of publications, or to duplicate publications without disclosing the previous publication. The following points provide further guidance regarding the publication and citation of research data.\\n\\n1. Place of publication. For the publication of research data, well-established discipline- or data-type-specific databases, repositories, and data centers should be preferred. Infrastructures should be used in which data are kept and can be referenced independently; research data should not exclusively be provided with the text publication as supplementary material.\\n\\n2. Preparation and availability of data. Research data should be made accessible in a processing stage (raw or structured data) that enables meaningful reuse by third parties. It is recommended to strive for consistent adherence to the FAIR data principles (findable, accessible, interoper able, and reusable) when preparing data for publication and selecting the place of publication.2 The four principles articulate the following basic requirements:\\n\\n\\n\\na. Findability: The data is sufficiently described with relevant metadata and referenced by a unique persistent identifier (e.g., a DOI).\\nb. Accessibility: The data is readable by both humans and machines and is stored in a trusted repository.\\nc. Interoperability: Data and metadata use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable vocabulary for knowledge representation.\\nd. Reusability: The data is unambiguously licensed, contains correct provenance information, and is well documented.3\\n\\nSelf-programmed research software should be made publicly available as source code. Source code of published software should be persistent, citable, and documented.4\\n\\n3. Authorship. A person who makes a genuine, accountable contribution to the content of academic data or software publication is an author. Such a contribution is established especially through substantial research-based involvement in the creation, collection, acquisition, or provision of the data, software, or sources.5\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4. Free licensing and open access. Research data and scientific software should be made available under established, standardized and, as far as possible, free and open licenses. Access conditions and, if applicable, embargo periods should adhere to the principle of “as open as possible, as closed as necessary”. The following points provide specific guidance for licensing:\\n\\na. Licensing and attribution: The obligation to attribute academic achievements is a principle of good scientific practice. Licenses and waivers for data and software that do not contractually require the attribution of the authors do not supersede this obligation. The preferred way to promote data and software citation is not through restrictive licensing but by including a recommended citation.\\n\\n\\n\\nb. Public research data: Creative Commons tools have become the most common way to license research data that is made publicly available. Data that is free of copyright and related rights should be labelled as such upon release using the “Creative Commons Zero” (CC0) waiver. For data that is protected by copyright or related rights, using the CC0 waiver is also recommended because it is the best way to ensure reusability. The license “Creative Commons Attribution” (CC BY) can also be considered, but due to the strict formal requirements regarding attribution and the provision of license information it already limits subsequent use. Creative Commons licenses with terms that go beyond the “Attribution” element are not suitable for licensing research data (“Non-Commercial”, NC; “No Derivative Works”, ND), or are suitable only in certain cases and only to a limited extent (“Sharing under Equal Conditions”, SA).6\\n\\n\\n\\nc. Research data for “Scientific Use” only: Research data to which access has to be restricted should be licensed in consultation with the approriate data center using the licenses recommended by them.\\n\\nd. Software: Creative Commons licenses (such as CC BY) are not suitable for software. A CC0 waiver can be granted for completely selfwritten code (to which the programmers own all rights). This is especially useful for short scripts. Free software licenses should be used for more complex products. Examples of common free software licenses are the MIT license and the GNU GPLv3.7\\n\\n\\n\\n5. Registration of research output. Quality-assured data and software publications that are recognized by the respective scientific community and can be referenced independently should be reported to the University Library by the authors for inclusion in the University Bibliography.\\n\\n6. Citation of data and software. If no subject-specific standards have been established yet for the citation of data and software and if no guidelines by the journal or the publisher are available, it is recommended to refer to the Data Citation Principles.8',\n",

Research data may take physical or digital form. Research data management involves activities throughout the research data lifecycle; planning and making decisions about the collection, protection, organisation, storage, preservation, publishing and sharing of research data. \\nResearchers Researchers refers to all University staff, postgraduate research students enrolled on a research degree, visiting or emeritus staff, associates, holders of honorary and clinical contracts, contractors and consultants and others working on the University premises or carrying out research activity in the name, or on behalf of the University of Salford, and across all subject disciplines and fields of study. \\nSensitivedata Sensitive data\\' is used as a catch-all term to refer to: research data containing personal identifying information, \\'personal data\\' and special category data as defined in UK data protection legislation; commercially sensitive data, including data generated or used data relating to species of plants or animals where the release of data may adversely affect rare or endangered species; data likely to harm an individual or community or have a significant negative public impact if released.

       " \"1. Policy Statement\\n\\n1.1. As one of the leading research-intensive universities in the world, the University of St Andrews places high value on the research conducted under its auspices; whether produced solely within its academic schools, its centres/institutes or as result of research pooling. More information on the University's research activities can be found at  \\n\\n1.2. The University is committed to excellence throughout its activities. These activities increasingly collect and produce raw and processed research data, much of which is valuable and needs to be retained over the long term. This applies equally to all disciplines.\\n\\n1.3. The purpose of research data management is to ensure that research data is managed according to good practices for collection, curation, storage, management, retrieval, re-use, sharing, archiving, preservation and access, as appropriate for the data and discipline concerned, to support researchers to:\\n\\n1.3.1. maximise the academic value of research data;\\n\\n1.3.2. meet the expectations set out in the University's relevant policy and guidance (see Section 2.3);\\n1.3.3. comply with any applicable requirements of funding agencies and other stakeholders;\\n1.3.4. where personal data is involved, protect the privacy of research participants by safeguarding their data; and\\n1.3.5. follow the FAIR guiding principles for data management and stewardship.\\n\\n1.4. The University expects that all research data will over time be made publicly available wherever possible consistent with any constraints necessary to meet funding requirements, statutory or ethical responsibilities, and as appropriate to the field or discipline. Our guiding principle is ‘as open as possible, as closed as necessary’.\\n\\n1.5. Data should, whenever possible, be deposited into an appropriate long-term archive. Such archives include national or international subject-specific archives, secure repositories for data with extreme confidentiality requirements, or a managed University repository (e.g. Pure). For the personal data of study participants, the measures indicated on the relevant ethical application form and communicated to the study participants must be adhered to when depositing data in a repository.\\n\\n1.6. Data underpinning publications should be made openly available wherever possible, with explicit Data Access Statements provided in publications. Data should have persistent identifiers to support citations, and be accompanied by rich metadata (including a description) to increase discoverability as recommended by the FAIR principles (paragraph 1.3.5).\\n\\n1.7. All research articles must include a Data Access Statement. Statements should enable citation of underpinning research data by providing a location with a unique identifier (DOI) and any terms of access. When there are no data associated with the article or the data are inaccessible a Data Access Statement must still be included stating the reason(s) why the data cannot be made available.\\n\\n1.8. The University will maintain a central catalogue of metadata descriptions for indexing, archiving, naming, and retrieval of datasets and other objects, and will register the DOI or other stable name of all objects being managed to support uniform treatment.\",\n",
       " '3.1 Researchers should ensure research data is managed responsibly and must adhere to ethical, legal, funder and other mandated requirements.\\n\\n3.1.1 All Researchers are expected to familiarise themselves with University research data management and sharing requirements and solutions, as well as disciplinary tools and infrastructure, including all costs, terms, and conditions governing their research. This includes being aware of and adhering to all relevant legislation and policies concerning data protection, copyright and Intellectual Property (IP) as outlined in Section 4.\\n\\n3.1.2 Principal Investigators must be aware of University and funder data requirements/terms and conditions of award; any project-related contractual and/or ethical agreements, and organise and direct data management activities, systems, and services accordingly. Principal Investigators should ensure all Researchers in the project team are aware of research data management and sharing policies and data requirements, as well as any contractual agreements which may impact on research data (for example, where there is a confidentiality agreement, which would necessitate a restriction or embargo to the release of data).\\n\\n3.1.3 Postgraduate Researchers are expected to be familiar with relevant, University and funder data policies and requirements, and best practice in their discipline.\\n\\n3.1.4 All Supervisors of Postgraduate Researchers are expected to provide support and guidance to supervisees. The Primary Supervisor must ensure supervisees are aware of research data management and sharing policies and data requirements, as well as any contractual agreements which may impact on research data (for example, where there is a confidentiality agreement, which would necessitate a restriction or embargo to the release of data).\\n\\n3.1.5 As a means to ensure the responsible management of research data, all student (PGR) and staff research projects are required to have a Data Management Plan (DMP) in place prior to the commencement of research (termed the ‘Provisional DMP’)1. This applies to all research projects regardless of whether there are funder data requirements/terms and conditions of awards. The Provisional DMP should document key decisions concerning data collection, storage, sharing and preservation (including what is and is not appropriate to share), and be kept up to date during the course of the project. As outlined in Section 4, in the interests of transparency and to enable monitoring of research data management and sharing practice, a copy of both the Provisional DMP and the version in place at project completion (termed the ‘Final DMP’) should be uploaded to the Data Management Plan inbox. These DMP documents will be retained for the same period as the associated research data (see section 4.6). If there is no associated research data, the documentation will be retained for three years following project completion to inform policy and guidance.',\n",
       " '4.1 Research projects working with research data are expected to create a project Data Management Plan (DMP) and data management costs should be factored into project applications as part of the grant submission process.\\n\\n4.1.1 In accordance with University/funder policies and sector best practice, all student (PGR) and staff research projects are required to have a DMP. As outlined in 3.1.5, a Provisional DMP should be in place prior to project commencement and updates should be made as required over the course of the project (treating it as a ‘living’ document), resulting in a Final DMP on project completion. The DMP should document key decisions concerning data collection, storage, sharing and preservation as appropriate to the project and in accordance with applicable funder data requirements and/or contractual/ethical agreements. In the interests of transparency and to enable monitoring of research data management and sharing practice, a copy of the Provisional DMP should be uploaded to the Data Management Plan inbox prior to project commencement and the Final DMP (reflecting any decisions/updates made during the project) should be similarly submitted once the project is complete.\\n\\n4.1.2 If the required resources to ensure effective research data management and sharing are not already available, these should be costed into project applications as appropriate. Researchers should consider costs that will be directly incurred, for example, researcher time to prepare data for preservation. Some research funders will cover expenses and costs relating to data management activities, if fully justified at application stage; for example, UKRI guidance states that ‘Support may be requested for any costs related to research data management which will be incurred during the project and not be covered by directly allocated or indirect costs.’2 Guidance on costing research projects can be sought from the Costing and Pricing Team in RKES.\\n\\n4.1.3 Researchers can use the University’s generic DMP template, which contains local information and prompts. Tailored templates, such as those that adhere to funder requirements, can be found on DMP Online. When applying for funding grants and bids, Researchers are likely to be asked to structure the DMP to fit the funder or scheme-specific template.\\n\\n4.1.4 Researchers can upload draft DMPs to the DMP Inbox for review and feedback. To assist Researchers with preparing a plan, there are also Data Management Plan tips on the RDMS website; training is available; and one-to-one meetings can be arranged to discuss data management planning for individual projects (requests should be made via email to researchdataprojects@strath.ac.uk).',\n",
       " '4.2 Arrangements for the long-term storage of large datasets should be factored into data management planning and costed into grant applications where appropriate.\\n\\n4.2.1 A decision on the long-term storage of large datasets will be assessed when offered for deposit. Datasets are considered large if they cannot be adequately dealt with by traditional data processing applications and infrastructure due to their size and complexity.\\n\\n4.2.2 If the research outputs from a funded project are expected to include very large datasets, this should be identified and costed at the DMP and grant application stage. This information will support RDMS Service decisions on storing and archiving large datasets.\\n\\n4.2.3 Very large data can be deposited in Pure on condition that it is appropriately packaged and documented. No individual files should exceed 20GB. FAIR consideration for re-use should ensure the data is accessible from the Pure Knowledgebase. Extremely large datasets may be held off-line in exceptional circumstances, in bespoke storage locations operated by the RDMS Service.\\n\\n4.2.4  Storing the files in such bespoke storage locations is not conducive to FAIR data principles, negatively impacting the findability and accessibility of the data. Planning at an early stage with the DMP will mitigate this possibility including any compliance requirements pertaining to data accessibility, and identify cases where the size of the data means that such bespoke storage locations become necessary.\\n\\n4.2.5  Projects must contact RDMS support to discuss the deposit of very large data, ideally at the DMP and deposit stages.\\n\\n4.3 Rights, licences, ownership and ethical considerations related to research data should be recognised and agreed at the earliest opportunity within a project.\\n\\n4.3.1 Where research involves collaboration with external parties/partners, Strathclyde Researchers must seek advice from Grants and Contract staff in RKES to arrange an appropriate contract and/or collaboration/consortia-type agreement that clearly records the rights each party possess and permissions each party provides to ensure research data can be used for current and future research.\\n\\n4.3.2 Data should be deposited with a clear license on the reuse of data. License options are available when finalising deposits in Pure. CC-BY is the preferred license for open data, which allows data users to copy, modify and distribute data in any format for any purpose, including commercial use, provided they acknowledge the data creators and give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made.\\n\\n4.3.3 Not all research data are suitable for open/public sharing, for example, research data containing protectable intellectual property or ‘personal data’ about research participants. In such cases, Researchers are encouraged to contact RDMS staff to discuss the most appropriate options for the data. Licence and re-use agreements can be tailored according to project requirements.',\n",
       " '4.4 Research data must be securely stored and managed throughout the time period they are retained.\\n\\n4.4.1 The University will identify active storage systems, which are suitable for storage of data during the active phase of research (while a project is ongoing), and long-term preservation systems, which are suitable for storage of data after a project has completed. Decisions on which storage systems are considered suitable for each phase will be taken by the University’s RDMS staff, and kept under regular review. These decisions will be taken in consultation with IS Infrastructure staff, and communicated to researchers.3\\n\\n4.4.2 Whilst a project is ongoing, research data should be securely stored on resilient, robust University active storage systems, and managed in line with the associated DMP. However, data should not be stored long-term on these systems. Data/files held on active storage platforms, such as Departmental/School i: drives, are not subject to the same preservation measures as they are when deposited in Pure (or another data repository). Moreover, data/files held in storage, linked to an individual’s DS login account (e.g., H: drive; Strathcloud personal folders; OneDrive for Business, etc.) will be deleted if/when the staff member/student leaves/graduates from the University.\\n\\n4.4.3 Following project completion, data should be archived for long term accessibility, curation and preservation in a suitable long-term preservation system. When data are deposited in Pure - as a dataset - they are catalogued, associated with metadata, assigned a persistent link/DOI, and are subject to preservation activity by Library staff, and thereafter retained for a minimum period of 10- years. Completed datasets deposited in Pure are additionally processed using the Archivematica Digital Preservation system.\\n\\n4.4.4 Once the project has completed, and the completed data has been stored on a suitable long-term preservation system, the data on the active storage system must be reviewed and deleted if it is no longer required on that system.  Decisions around deletion of data from the active store must recognise the significant ongoing financial cost to the University, and the environmental impact, of retaining data in the active store unnecessarily.\\n\\n4.4.5 Sensitive data, for example, research data containing protectable intellectual property or ‘personal data’ about research participants, can be stored in Pure with the appropriate confidentiality restrictions, for example, by restricting visibility of the complete dataset, or applying an embargo to specific files. Restrictions should be minimised by any means possible, for instance by providing accessible information about how the data was collected, whether it can be accessed on a one-toone basis under a non-disclosure agreement (NDA), or whether a subset of the data can be made available).

       " '4.5 Research data and accompanying metadata and documentation must be registered in the University’s research information system, Pure.\\n\\n4.5.1  To support University monitoring and reporting on the research data produced by its Researchers, and to ensure the data are Findable, dataset records must be created and ultimately finalised in Pure following project completion or at the point of publication if this occurs during the project. As a general rule, data should be deposited in Pure within 3 months of project completion, unless necessary restrictions apply.\\n\\n4.5.2 In cases where a dataset is deposited with a trusted external data repository, for example, a subjectspecific repository or one operated by the lead institution on a project, Researchers must create a dataset record in Pure, with metadata and a persistent identifier, such as a Digital Object Identifier (DOI), directing to the source of the externally deposited dataset. There are numerous data repositories, some domain-specific, others which are advocated by a funder or publisher. Researchers should check if external data repositories specialising in their research area already exist and prioritise deposit in these repositories as they are designed for their disciplines and datasets. Assistance on locating such resources and evaluating their suitability against FAIR principles, University policy and any project-specific agreements can be accessed from the RDMS Service.\\n\\n4.5.3 As far as possible, data deposited externally should be openly accessible. If external data are deposited in a restricted format and the dataset is at risk of deletion, Researchers should offer this data for deposit in Pure for preservation purposes.\\n\\n4.5.4 In cases where the research is sensitive and/or confidential, a Researcher may request that the data (and descriptive metadata) are embargoed or restricted (for instance, to allow time to publish research findings, or comply with contractual obligations). Decisions to approve requests will be made by the RDMS Service in the first instance, although responsibility for ensuring deposited datasets with sensitive or confidential data are restricted in Pure lies with the Researcher.\\n\\n4.5.5  Each dataset in Pure should have an assigned contact responsible for dealing with any enquiries relating to the dataset. The contact person will normally be the Principal Investigator. If the Principal Investigator leaves the University, a new contact person should be identified before the departure date. If no new contact person is identified, it will default to the relevant Head of School /Department.\\n\\n4.5.6  Where a dataset record draft is started but not finalised, it can remain as an ‘entry in progress’ record for a maximum of 24 months, after which point the record will be deleted. Where a dataset record is required to remain at ‘entry in progress’ for longer than 24 months, an appropriate maximum retention period should be noted in the dataset description.\\n\\n4.5.7  Dataset records must by related to any other relevant content in Pure including publications, projects, activities and impacts.\\n\\n4.6 Research data that contribute to published research findings, or that have acknowledged long-term value, must be retained for a minimum of 10 years, or longer if stipulated by the funder or advised by discipline convention.\\n\\n4.6.1 Research data that contribute to published research findings must be deposited as in the requirement above and must be retained in order to demonstrate the integrity of the research and any published research findings. For guidance on how research data deposit activities align with the publication timeline, see the RDMS Integrated Workflow.\\n\\n4.6.2 Research data that underpins research findings must be preserved for a minimum period of 10 years, from date of last access/use. In some disciplines, such as clinical trial data, the advised retention period may be 20 years; for environmental data, this may be indefinite.\\n\\n4.6.3 Some funders require that data with acknowledged long-term value also be preserved and remain accessible and usable for future research4. Data with acknowledged long-term value should be preserved for a minimum period of 10 years, from date of last access/use, as above.\\n\\n4.6.4 A minimum retention period longer than 10 years may be specified by third parties for specific types of research output. Researchers can check the required retention period with the RDMS Service.',\n",
       " '5. Rights relating to research data\\n\\nOwnership is a critical consideration in the management and sharing of research data. All right-holders should be identified at the earliest opportunity so that appropriate action can be taken to uphold their rights in accordance with relevant legislation and policies including the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR); UK Copyright law; and the University’s Intellectual Property (IP) & Commercialisation Policy. Besides Researchers, typical holders of rights to research data are collaborators, research participants, existing data owners and the University (as employer). The following examples illustrate some of the considerations that relate to these:\\n\\nCollaborators: Where research projects/studies involve collaboration with partners, industry, NHS etc., in most cases collaboration and contractual agreements will be drawn up to manage and document these partnerships. These legal agreements and contracts must be factored into project data management planning so that data are managed in line with agreed processes and licence agreements, and to ensure that data, which may, for example, not be suitable for public disclosure are not released inadvertently. The project Principal Investigator is responsible for appraising supervisees about any contractual agreements and the University’s Research and Knowledge Exchange Services (RKES) should be consulted in matters relating to legal, ethical, or commercial rights. If a formal collaboration agreement is not required, decisions regarding the storage and sharing of data should be documented in the Data Management Plan prior to project commencement, with any subsequent changes made with the consent off all parties concerned.\\n\\nResearch participants: Where research has involved the collection and/or processing of personal data, data protection legislation and ethical requirements must be complied with to ensure that the participants’ rights are respected. Where a research project/study has involved collecting data from people, for example, from focus groups or interviews, and there is a plan to publish large extracts of participants’ words, appropriate transfer of copyright must be in place.7\\n\\nExisting data owners: Where a project/study has used existing or secondary data sources, Researchers would not be expected to deposit existing/secondary data sources in Pure (unless there is a project agreement to state otherwise) - as they belong to the original data creators/owners. Instead, Researchers should include details of any published existing data sources used in the research by including the hyperlinks to the sources, initially in the DMP, and in the metadata - i.e., when describing the dataset. This way anyone wishing to scrutinise the research, would know where, and how, to access the existing/secondary data sources used, and then they too could arrange access for themselves. New data, derived from analyses of existing/secondary sources, can be deposited in Pure (if appropriate).\\n\\nThe University: In most cases, the IP generated by University Staff and Postgraduate Researchers in the course of their employment is the property of the University (making research data a Universityowned asset). For this reason, research data must be deposited into the institutional repository, Pure, at the end of the project or when a Researcher leaves employment and/or study with the University.8',\n",

These plans are to be updated and maintained during the life of the research project.\\n\\nResearchers, in particular principal investigators, are responsible for creating and updating a research data management plan for research projects in accordance with funder and university expectations.\\n\\n2.3 For data underpinning published research findings, reasonable efforts should be made to make them available for access and re-use with as few restrictions as possible, where legally, ethically and commercially appropriate. This should be done in a timely manner, no later than 12 months after publication or as soon as required by publishers and funders.\\n\\n2.4 Where it can be made accessible, research data should be deposited in a data service, disciplinary data repository, or the University’s Open Access repository as appropriate.\\n\\nResearchers are responsible for identifying, preparing, and transferring data for sharing and/or preservation to appropriate repositories, including the University’s repository. In special cases, Library and IT Services may facilitate transfer and dissemination (e.g. very large datasets or sensitive data).\\n\\n2.5 Unless explicitly stated in a collaborative contract where Intellectual Property Right (IPR) or data responsibility is retained by another institution, all research data must be registered with the University by creating a metadata record in the University’s repository, even if the data is hosted elsewhere (e.g., in a third-party repository).\\n\\nResearchers are responsible for registering their research data by creating a metadata record in the University’s repository or by sending a link to an existing repository record to the Library’s Open Research team.

This includes the management of all research data collected, generated or used during a project. A research data management plan must be in place at the start of the research, before any work with research data takes place.\\n\\nResearchers are responsible for seeking, where possible, the direct costs of research data management, including the preparation of data for archiving, from their research funder. The resources necessary for the appropriate management of data throughout its life course should be set out in the Research Data Management Plan.\\n\\nCollaborative research involving partners outside the University should normally be the subject of a collaboration agreement, and the arrangements for management of research data must be clearly set out in the agreement.\\n\\nAll research data is subject to the University’s Intellectual Property Policy, and intellectual property issues related to research data must be considered at the outset. Exclusive rights to research data must not be granted to a third party where this will restrict the ability to make the data openly available for re-use unless this is a condition of funding or of a collaboration agreement. The intellectual property rights of others in third party data being used for research must be respected. Commitments about IP, either explicit or implicit, must not be made in communications with companies or other external organisations (see the UWE guide on Intellectual Property and Research).\\n\\nResearchers are responsible for complying with UWE’s data security requirements as outlined in UWE guidance, including the Information Security Toolkit, Research Data Security Guidance and Data Protection Guidance.\\n\\no Research data should be actively managed throughout the research lifecycle to protect its integrity and security. Where research data is stored, it must be stored and backed up according to law and regulation, and UWE guidelines.\\no Confidential data must only be stored on UWE approved systems. Other cloud hosted systems are not permitted for this purpose.\\no Researchers must use UWE managed devices, and UWE approved software solutions, to create, store or process restricted or confidential information.\\no Access to data should be controlled, and there should always be more than one appropriate person with access to the data.\\no Where data is collected, transported or stored off site, this must be strictly in accordance with UWE research data security guidance.\\no Where personal data (as defined by the Data Protection Act) is likely to cross international boundaries, the UWE Data Protection Office must be consulted.\\n\\nIf the UWE Research Project Manager leaves the university, it is the responsibility of the Dean of School to ensure that an appropriate hand over of data takes place, and a new UWE Research Project Manager with responsibility for the data is immediately in place. In the absence of such an arrangement, the Dean of School will be deemed the Research Project Manager in relation to the data.

This includes understanding and complying with any provisions regarding the ownership, preservation and dissemination of research data of research contracts with or grants to the University.\\n\\n5.3 In line with good practice, researchers are strongly encouraged to routinely prepare, maintain and adhere to a data management plan for their research projects. Data management plans should address the capture, management, integrity, confidentiality, retention, ownership, sharing and publication of research data, including compliance with relevant legal and ethical frameworks. Plans must also adhere to any funder requirements where these exist.\\n\\n5.4 Researchers will identify the resources required to effectively manage research data and will seek, where possible, to recover the direct costs of managing research data and any work needed to make the data available for sharing from their research funder.\\n\\n5.5 Researchers will protect confidential, personal and sensitive research data in accordance with legal and ethical requirements related to the research they conduct. Legal, ethical and commercial constraints on the sharing of research data must be considered at the initiation of the research process and throughout the research data lifecycle, and will normally be described in a data management plan.\\n\\n5.6 Researchers will preserve and provide appropriate access to their research data for as long as it is of continuing value to the researcher and the wider research community, and as long as specified by research funders, patent law, legislative and other regulatory requirements.\\n\\n5.7 Researchers should offer the research data they have selected for preservation and sharing to an appropriate data repository, along with sufficient descriptive metadata and documentation to ensure that it can be found and understood. Where research data is deposited somewhere other than the University’s data repository (Research Data York), a dataset record should also be created in the University’s Research Information System (PURE) which describes and points to the data.\\n\\n5.8 Researchers must include a data access statement in their published research outputs which clearly describes how and on what terms any supporting data may be accessed.\\n\\n5.9 Technicians, professional and support staff instrumental in contributing to the collection and/or generation of research data should be acknowledged and their contribution specified in descriptive metadata and in data access statements.\\n\\n5.10 Researchers must securely dispose of research data identified for deletion or destruction, in accordance with legal, ethical, research funder and collaborator requirements and with particular concern for the confidentiality and security of the data.\\n\\n5.11 Where research is undertaken by postgraduate researchers, it is the responsibility of the staff member supervising their project to ensure that the postgraduate researcher has a clear understanding of their research data management responsibilities and engages with training and development as necessary.

To this end, the scope, timing, and appropriate licensing conditions for research data must be defined in accordance with intellectual property rights and on the condition that no third-party rights, statutory provisions, data rights, or other property rights conflict with this.\\n\\nResearch data should be stored with suitable metadata in a trustworthy, subject-specific repository or data centre/archive system or the institutional research data repository of the University of Bayreuth RDSpace@UBT16 for the long term and made as openly accessible as possible. To ensure long-term citability of research data, the use of persistent identifiers (e.g. DOI) is recommended. This makes the origin of reused data traceable, and the data source or the data provider can be credited.\\n\\nResearch data and documents that ensure the documentation and reproducibility of the results should be stored and kept accessible for as long as is necessary in accordance with legal requirements or the requirements of research funders within the framework of the applicable legal and contractual provisions. The minimum retention period for research data and documents is 10 years after publication by assignment of a DOI. As a rule, research data should be kept for at least 10 years after publication of the research findings or after completion of the research project (whichever is the later).\\n\\nIf research data and associated documents are to be deleted or destroyed after the retention period has expired, or for legal or ethical reasons, these measures need to take legal and ethical considerations into account. The deletion must be documented and justified. When deciding whether to retain or delete data, the interests and contractual provisions of third-party funders and other parties, in particular contributors and cooperation partners, must be taken into account.

This includes materials of any type created in the course of academic activities, e.g. through digitisation, recordings, studies of source materials, experiments, measurements, surveys or interviews. This also includes software and code. Research data may exist in a range of different forms. Data can pass through various phases over the course of their lifecycle: from raw data, processed data (including “negative” or “inconclusive results”) and shared data to published data and Open Access published data. They can also have different degrees of accessibility (Open Data, Restricted Data, Closed Data).\\n\\n(Research Data) Repositories are managed servers for storing, describing, archiving and publishing digital objects and data. One global registry of research data repositories across all academic disciplines is re3data.org.\\n\\nA persistent identifier is a permanent reference to a document, file, web page or other object. It allows access to a digital object via a persistent link. Examples of persistent identifiers include Digital Object Identifiers (DOI) and Uniform Resource Names (URN).\\n\\nThe “FAIR Data Principles” lay down guidelines that sustainably reusable research data must fulfil and that research data infrastructures should implement within the framework of the services they provide. According to the FAIR principles, data should be \"Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable\".\\n\\nA Principal Investigator is an individual responsible for taking binding decisions and who oversees the funding and expenditures for a particular research project or activity, or a project’s lead researcher.\\n\\nFree licences: A licence is a set of legal terms attached to an original work that serve as an extension of copyright. It defines what may and may not be done with a work, grants permissions, and specifies restrictions. An open or free licence, such as a Creative Commons licence, essentially allows access, reuse and redistribution of a work with few or no restrictions. The precise permissions depend on the full text of the licence being applied.\\n\\nA Data Management Plan (DMP) is a structured guideline (document or online tool) which depicts the entire lifecycle of the data and which can be updated as needed. Data management plans must ensure that research data are traceable, available, authentic, citable and properly stored and that they comply with clearly defined legal parameters and appropriate measures for subsequent use. Ideally, DMPs should be delivered in a machine-actionable format.\\n\\nMetadata are data about data that describe characteristics and properties of objects, works and information.\\n\\nScientific integrity and good scientific practice: Scientific integrity is understood as a comprehensive ethical awareness in the sense of a culture of honesty and responsibility for quality in science. According to the Austrian Agency for Research Integrity Guidelines for Good Scientific Practice (2015), the standards of good scientific practice include, among other things, precise recordkeeping and documentation of the scientific process as well as the results to ensure that the research is reproducible. This includes the collection of primary and original data (processed raw material), in a manner that is transparent, seamlessly recorded and documented. Where they serve as the basis for publications, these data and documents (e.g. laboratory notes) are to be stored on durable, backed-up data media in the research institution where they were generated, with due attention paid to the retention periods applicable to the specific field of research wherever necessary for the purpose of ensuring the verifiability of the method selected and the findings generated. This includes ensuring that access to data is as open as possible, as restricted as necessary and, where appropriate, in accordance with the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data management principles. Reference is also made to the University of Graz document Grundsätze zur Sicherung guter wissenschaftlicher Praxis und zur Vermeidung von Fehlverhalten in der Wissenschaft [Principles for Ensuring Good Scientific Practice and Avoiding Misconduct in Science] (2004).',\n",
       " 'III. Final phase: after completion of the research project\\n\\nAccording to good scientific practice, research data must be archived and made available by the end of a project. In particular, public access has become a necessity in recent years in order to facilitate the traceability of research results as well as subsequent reuse of the data. It is recommended to publish research data following the principle \"as open as possible, as restricted as necessary\".\\n\\nThere are various ways to publish research data. In addition to domain-agnostic repositories, a large number of discipline-specific repositories exist. To find a suitable repository for your research data, the portal re3data.org 6  provides extensive search and filter capabilities. In addition, there are special data journals for publishing research data. In some disciplines it is common practice to publish data as a supplement to the respective article. However, this form of data publication has the disadvantage that the data can only be found via the article and does not form an independent, citable publication object\\n\\nWhen selecting a publication method, the following criteria should be taken into account: long-term availability (at least 10 years), allocation of persistent identifiers (e.g. DOI, URN), licensing and usage terms of the data, visibility and cost.\\n\\nAs a member of the FSU, you may publish and archive research data with the Digital Library of Thuringia (DBT)7.\\n\\nIf you published research data with an external repository, you are requested to register this publication with the Digital Library Thuringia, too.\\n\\nIndividual websites (e.g. of projects, departments, employees) are generally not suitable for the publication of research data. The long-term availability of such websites is often not guaranteed and non-ambiguous identification (keyword: PID) and cross-referencing is limited.\\n\\nWhen selecting the data to be published, the DFG (2015) recommends, \"Data should be made accessible at a stage of processing that allows it to be usefully reused by third parties (raw data or structured data).\" In particular, data that served as the foundation of a scientific article should be made public.\\n\\nAs with scientific articles, research data should also receive a unique, persistent identifier (PID). A PID (e.g. DOI, URN) is typically provided by the repository or data journal at the time of publication. In order to mandate usage and exploitation rights of your research data, data should always be published with a corresponding license. The selected license should allow at least open access for scientific purposes. Specific requirements of the funding organisation or repositories may apply and need to be considered. Suitable data licenses are available from Open Data Commons8 or the Creative Commons9. In general, research data should be published as soon as possible. However, there may be reasons to publish research data with an embargo period. In this case, the data is submitted to the repository for archiving, but it is only accessible after the end of the embargo period. The researchers who are responsible for the data determine the length of the embargo period, unless otherwise requested by the policies and guidelines of funding organisations or the repositories. Embargo periods should not exceed 1-2 years after the end of the project.\\n\\nVorstehende Handlungsempfehlung wurde am 20.
