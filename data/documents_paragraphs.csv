aalto-university.md,## Aalto University Research Data Management Policy
aalto-university.md,"The research data management policy aims to make data management easier for the individual researcher. Managing and curating data creates competitive edge, and allocating resources for that is a strategic choice of the university. The purposes of this policy are to (1) encourage to informed decision making in research data management and (2) define the principles used in the opening of publicly funded scientific research data to achieve wide societal impact and the strategic goals of Aalto University."
aalto-university.md,"The data management policy shall be implemented through conscious and strategic decisions. Open access publishing of research data aims to make research data easily discoverable, assessable, intelligible, usable and interoperable. Where applicable, these requirements can also be applied to data other than open access published research data, and to the software needed to handle the open data. The decisions to publish software, other than the software explicitly needed to handle the data, are done using the same conscious and strategic grounds as opening of the research data."
aalto-university.md,"Ownership of copyright protected research data is transferred to Aalto University if the data is created in an externally funded research project of Aalto University.  Strategic decisions about opening such data are done by the principal investigators. These decisions are done following the guidelines for ethical principles of research as well as the guidelines for responsible conduct of research, project agreements and guidelines for processing of personal data in scientific research,"
aalto-university.md,"Research data is not opened if the opening would violate privacy, safety, security, terms of project agreements or legitimate concerns of private partners. Researchers shall follow the ""Guideline on nondisclosure of information and information security classification at Aalto University"" and its appendix ""Rules on the handling of information materials""."
aalto-university.md,"When deciding on the opening of research data, the possibilities for commercially exploiting the research results and data are taken into consideration. Aalto University will make agreements about the user rights of third parties according to the strategic goals of the university. Aalto University may also charge a fee from third parties for the use of research data."
aalto-university.md,"Openness of scientific research data will increase the scientific impact of the research, speed up the adoption of research findings and the creation of innovations, enable transparency in science, as well as ensure that research data has wide societal impact and usability in solving global challenges."
aalto-university.md,"Opening access to research data shall be made easy for researchers and implemented in a cost-effective manner so that the resources invested are proportioned to the benefits attainable. An appropriate digital infrastructure will be made available to the researchers by combined European, national and Aalto University efforts."
aalto-university.md,"The Aalto University research data management policy applies to digital research materials produced, used and revised in research projects, i.e. research data. Physical materials on which research data are based shall be excluded from research data, along with the use of biological research materials. The concept of"

aalto-university.md,Appendix 1
aalto-university.md,"research data is not specified further in this policy, as the quality and quantity of research data that is chosen for open access publishing is also chosen using the criteria above. (As regards university document preservation, a data management plan (DMP) required by the Archives Act and the instructions provided by Aalto University’s Archive and Registry Services  shall be abided by.)"
aalto-university.md,"### Principles for open access publishing of research data (recommended to be acknowledged in data management in general, where applicable)"
aalto-university.md,#### 1. Discoverability
aalto-university.md,The location of research data and the necessary software to access the data is known and they are easily discoverable and identifiable by means of a standard international identification mechanism.
aalto-university.md,#### 2. Accessibility
aalto-university.md,"Research data and the necessary software to access the data shall be easily accessible, along with other necessary information to access the data, such as a mention of the concerned research areas."
aalto-university.md,"An embargo period can be agreed upon, to achieve strategic advantage for the creator. The embargo period is expressed in connection with the material."
aalto-university.md,"For the research data, a licensing framework has been selected for research and educational use and for commercial exploitation. The license recommended for research data is Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) and the waiver recommended for metadata is CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication. The license recommended for software is the MIT Licence. Other licenses may be chosen to achieve the strategic goals of the research project. If research data is published using the CC BY 4.0 license, Aalto University and researchers obtain sufficient rights for the re-use of the data, even though the ownership of the research data is not transferred to the University. The terms of the CC BY 4.0 license require that the creators of the research data are attributed."
aalto-university.md,#### 3. Assessability and intelligibility
aalto-university.md,The research data and the necessary software to access the data shall be assessable for and intelligible to third parties for scientific scrutiny and peer review. Research data shall be published together with related scientific publications for the purposes of peer review. Research data shall be provided in a way that judgements can be made about its reliability and the competence of those who created it.
aalto-university.md,#### 4. Usability
aalto-university.md,"The research data and the necessary software to access the data shall also be usable for purposes beyond the original project. The research data chosen for long-term preservation shall be safely stored and curated to ensure its usability for wider needs than merely a highly specialised expert group. Whenever possible, certified repositories are used for research data preservation."
aalto-university.md,Research data shall be stored together with the minimum metadata and documentation to make it useful. Aalto University does not require the creator of the research data to offer support for further use of the data.
aalto-university.md,"When applicable and allowed by previous licenses, the necessary software will also be stored together with the research data."
aalto-university.md,#### 5. Interoperability
aalto-university.md,"The research data and the necessary software shall be produced in a manner that ensures their interoperability with applicable standards and special quality requirements. Interoperability shall be implemented in a way that allows data exchange between researcher groups, higher education institutions and research institutions in different countries. Interoperability will also allow for the re-combination of different datasets from different origins."

aston-university.md,"Ensure that University Colleges understand their responsibilities in relation to governance of research data management in their departments, Ensure that the University responsibilities for research data management are clearly articulated."
aston-university.md,### 2. SCOPE OF POLICY
aston-university.md,"This policy covers the processes, arrangements, and limitations for storing research data during the active research process."
aston-university.md,"For the purposes of this policy, research data are as defined by the UKRI Concordat on Open Research Data1 as ‘the evidence that underpins the answer to a research question’. The research data can be quantitative or qualitative and may either be primary (generated first hand) or processed secondary data (building upon primary data) where the rights for the original data may be held elsewhere. Contemporary research data tends to exist digitally and takes many different forms including documents, spreadsheets, code, models, transcripts, images etc. However historic, and visual data can still exist in physical records including books, sketches, photographs, audiotapes, and specimens."
aston-university.md,For a more comprehensive table of research data examples please see Appendix 1.
aston-university.md,"If you are engaged in a Knowledge Exchange activity whereby you are generating research data, you are expected to abide by the standards set out within this policy."
aston-university.md,Research data preservation for the purpose of sharing is covered by the Data Preservation and Open Research Data Policy.

aston-university.md,"Kept in a manner that is compliant with legal obligations, University policy and, where applicable, the requirements of funding bodies; and"
aston-university.md,Considered for long term preservation.
aston-university.md,"Clear arrangements for research data management must be in place prior to research data generation. The University recommends that all research projects have an associated Research Data Management plan (RDMP), with named researchers and their responsibilities detailed within. This may be a mandatory requirement as part of a grant application, and your Strategic Funding Manager will advise if so. It is the responsibility of the researcher to consider how legal and ethical restrictions will impact on their ability to share data at the end of the project and it is recommended that these considerations are addressed in a RDMP."
aston-university.md,"Research data must be stored and disposed of securely according to the relevant retention and disposal schedule, in accordance with legal, ethical, research funder and collaborator requirements and with particular concern for the confidentiality and security of the data. Records relating to research (e.g. master copies of approved consent forms, information sheets, records relating to ethical approval) should be retained for six years after the date of project closure, in line with the University Records Management Procedures. Research data that underpins published results or is considered to have long-term value should be retained."
aston-university.md,"Research data should be stored on Box unless there are specific reasons why this is not practical, nor in line with a collaboration agreement (for example). In this case advice should be sought from Digital Services in the first instance, and the Research Integrity Office where appropriate."
aston-university.md,The deliberate or reckless mismanagement of research data and/or primary materials constitutes unacceptable research conduct and should be reported in line with the University Research Misconduct Policy or the Whistleblowing policy.

bangor-university.md,# DATA PROTECTION POLICY
bangor-university.md,Bangor University takes its responsibilities with regard to the management of the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Data Protection Act 2018 (the Act) very seriously. This document provides the policy framework through which this effective management can be achieved and audited.
bangor-university.md,## 1. Purpose & Scope
bangor-university.md,The purpose of this policy is to ensure that the University and the University’s staff and students comply with the provisions of the GDPR and the Act and with any other relevant legislation in jurisdictions in which the University operates when processing personal data. Any infringement of the Act will be treated seriously by the University and may be considered under disciplinary procedures.
bangor-university.md,"This policy applies to staff, students, agents of the University and any authorised processors of personal data held or owned by the University, regardless of where the data is held and, in respect of automatically processed data, the ownership of the equipment used, if the processing is for University purposes.  This policy also applies to personal data retained and processed by Bangor University Students’ Union."
bangor-university.md,## 2. Data Protection Definitions
bangor-university.md,### 2.1 Personal data
bangor-university.md,"Personal data is information that either on its own, or when combined with other information, can identify a living individual. This can include (but is not limited to):"
bangor-university.md,"Names, addresses, student and staff ID numbers, dates of birth, photographs, social media handles, video footage and emails."
bangor-university.md,"The main types of personal data that the University uses are: Staff Data, Student Data (prospective, current and alumni) and Research Data."
bangor-university.md,### 2.2 Special Category Data
bangor-university.md,Special category data is personal data that needs more protection because it is sensitive. The GDPR defines special category data as:
bangor-university.md,personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin;
bangor-university.md,personal data revealing political opinions;
bangor-university.md,personal data revealing religious or philosophical beliefs;
bangor-university.md,personal data revealing trade union membership;
bangor-university.md,genetic data;
bangor-university.md,biometric data (where used for identification purposes);
bangor-university.md,data concerning health;
bangor-university.md,data concerning a person’s sex life; and data concerning a person’s sexual orientation.
bangor-university.md,### 2.3 Processing
bangor-university.md,"Data protection legislation refers to the processing of personal data. Processing simply means any use of personal data. This can range from collecting it to sharing it, from amending it to deleting it. The University needs to process information about its employees, its students and other individuals: for example, to allow it to"
bangor-university.md,"monitor performance, achievements and health and safety, and so that staff can be recruited and paid, courses organised and legal obligations (e.g. to funding bodies and the government) fulfilled. Such information must be collected and used fairly, stored safely and not disclosed unlawfully."
bangor-university.md,## 3. The Principles of Data Protection
bangor-university.md,The University is required to adhere to the principles of data protection as laid down by the Act. In accordance with those principles personal data shall be:
bangor-university.md,"1.  Processed fairly, lawfully and in a transparent manner The University must be open and clear about what the personal data will be used for and how it will be used."
bangor-university.md,"2.  Processed for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes The University must ensure that it collects personal data for clear, appropriate and legitimate purposes. Collecting personal data “just in case” for future reference is not compliant with legislation."
bangor-university.md,"3.  Adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the purposes for which they are processed The University must only collect, use or share personal data in a proportionate way. This means that it should collect what it needs to complete its purposes."
bangor-university.md,4.  Accurate and up to date Personal data must be accurate and up to date. Collecting inaccurate data is a breach of GDPR.
bangor-university.md,5.  Kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed
bangor-university.md,Personal data must only be kept for a specific period of time. This time period will vary depending on what purpose the personal data is collected for - the University’s Record & Data Retention Schedule details how long personal data should be kept for each function.
bangor-university.md,6.  Processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data

bangor-university.md,## Appendix 1
bangor-university.md,### Disclosure Procedure: Request for Information by Law Enforcement Agencies
bangor-university.md,### 1. Background
bangor-university.md,"These Procedures are intended to cover situations where the University receives requests from the Police or other organisations / agencies with law enforcement responsibilities (such as the Department for Work and Pensions, local authorities, HM Customs and Revenue and the UK Visas and Immigration) for personal information about students, staff or other individuals whose information the University holds.  These Procedures also include requests for the provision of any CCTV footage2."
bangor-university.md,Personal information held by the University is managed in accordance with the Data Protection Act 2018 (the Act) and the University’s Data Protection Policy3.  The Act and the University’s Policy provide guidance on the circumstances when it is lawful to disclose and transfer personal information outside the University and in general this should be carried out “fairly and lawfully” and in accordance with the University’s Data Protection Notification.
bangor-university.md,"There are, however, exemptions within the Act which allow the University, under strict guidelines, to release information to law enforcement agencies without the consent of the individual whose information is being released, and regardless of the purpose for which the information was originally collected."
bangor-university.md,In particular personal information may be released if:
bangor-university.md,"the information is required for safeguarding national security failure to provide the information would prejudice the prevention or detection of crime, the apprehension or prosecution of offenders or the assessment or collection of any tax or duty"
bangor-university.md,Personal information may also be disclosed without contravening the terms of the Act where that disclosure is required by law.
bangor-university.md,Before the University releases any information to a law enforcement agency it must satisfy itself that the disclosure is necessary and required for a legitimate purpose.
bangor-university.md,The University seeks to co-operate with the police and with other agencies in the prevention and detection of crime and these Procedures set out the steps to be followed when responding to requests for personal information from these external agencies.
bangor-university.md,These Procedures should also be considered in conjunction with the University’s Prevent Policy and its Information Sharing Agreement with partners to the Prevent and Channel Programme.
bangor-university.md,### 2. Requests for Information
bangor-university.md,"It is important that the University responds to all requests for information in a consistent manner and the University therefore operates a Single Point of Contact system for all law enforcement requests which is overseen by the Head of Governance and Compliance, Governance and Compliance Office.  To facilitate this any member of staff who receives a request for personal information from the Police or any other agency with law enforcement responsibilities must forward it as soon as possible to the Compliance and Records Officer or the Head of Governance and Compliance.  The Head of Governance and Compliance will then ensure that the request is handled in accordance with the remainder of these Guidelines.  Further advice on requests for information from the police or other agencies should be directed to the Head of Governance and Compliance."
bangor-university.md,"Staff should not feel pressurised to disclose information “on the spot”, as it is very rare that the police or agencies require the information urgently (although such circumstances are dealt with in Section 4 below)."
bangor-university.md,### 3. Governance and Compliance Office Procedures
bangor-university.md,#### [a] Police Requests
bangor-university.md,"All police forces have standard forms which must be used to request personal information from Bangor University, in accordance with guidance issued by the Association of Chief Police Officers.  The form must certify that the information is required for an investigation concerning national security, the prevention or detection of crime or the apprehension or prosecution of offenders, and that the investigation would be prejudiced by a failure to disclose the information.  All requests from the police, (apart from emergency requests, which are dealt with at section 4. below,) should be received on a data protection form, should clearly state all the information being requested and should be signed and dated by an officer of the rank of Sergeant or above."
bangor-university.md,#### [b] Other Agencies with Law Enforcement Responsibilities
bangor-university.md,"Other agencies may not routinely use standard forms to submit their requests.  However, any request for personal information should:"
bangor-university.md,"Be in writing, on headed paper, and signed by an officer of the agency;"
bangor-university.md,Describe the nature of the information which is requested;
bangor-university.md,"Describe the nature of the investigation in broad terms, including citing any relevant statutory authority for requesting the information;"
bangor-university.md,Certify that the information is necessary for the investigation.
bangor-university.md,"On receipt of such a request the data would normally be disclosed, after due consideration of the University’s legal position to provide such data, by the Head of Governance and Compliance."
bangor-university.md,### 4. Requests for Disclosure of Information in Emergency Situations
bangor-university.md,"The University acknowledges that, from time to time and in extraordinary circumstances, police forces, other law enforcement agencies or other emergency services may urgently require personal data from the University and may not be in a position to complete the usual required paperwork at that time.  These requests are usually received by the University’s Security Section but may be received by any member of staff. Requests of this type would include urgent requests for provision of CCTV footage for genuine police operational reasons and / or requests for contact information for members of staff or students."
bangor-university.md,"In these circumstances, during normal office hours, staff should contact the Compliance and Records Officer or the Head of Governance and Compliance, in the first instance for advice and authorisation before providing any information / CCTV footage."
bangor-university.md,"If the request is being dealt with out of normal office hours, during University holidays or at a weekend and information or images are required immediately to deal with an ongoing police or other law enforcement incident the procedures outlined below should be followed:"
bangor-university.md,"1. The University’s Security Section should note all of the emergency information required, the circumstances of the request and the name, rank and number of the requesting Police Officer."
bangor-university.md,2. Authorisation and / or advice should then be sought advice from the Campus Services Manager (Security) or Deputy.
bangor-university.md,"3. Where the request isn’t straightforward, or the information isn’t easily located the Campus Services Manager (Security) or Deputy may seek advice from the Head of Governance and Compliance."
bangor-university.md,"4. Once the release of information or images is authorised the Security Team Leader or Assistant should note in the security log the exact circumstances of the request, the name, rank and number of the requesting Police Officer. This information should be forwarded to the Compliance and Records Officer and the Head of Governance and Compliance as soon as practicably possible."
bangor-university.md,"5. If information / images are released in emergency circumstances the Governance and Compliance Team will ensure that the request is followed up with a formal written request from the relevant law enforcement agency, either by supplying a data protection form or a letter on headed paper appropriately authorised."
brunel-university-london.md,# Brunel University Research Data Management Policy
brunel-university-london.md,"Researchers and the University have obligations to preserve, store and provide access to research outputs, including research data. Demonstrable good practice in research data management and a commitment to data sharing are increasingly required by funding organisations and research partners. There are also benefits for the University and individual researchers: increased research impact and profile; wider benefits for the research community and the public; advancement of knowledge; opportunities for growth."
brunel-university-london.md,"The following policy supports the Brunel University Research Data Management Vision, which was approved by Senate in March 2012 and forms part of the University’s research integrity code of practice."
brunel-university-london.md,## Vision
brunel-university-london.md,"Research data management is the planning, capture, review, publication, storage, preservation and re-use of data produced by research, irrespective of format."
brunel-university-london.md,The University views effective research data management as an essential ingredient of a high quality research culture.
brunel-university-london.md,"It assumes that all data produced by University researchers will be made available to the wider academic community, except where the right of individual researchers, or the subjects of the research, would be compromised by such release."
brunel-university-london.md,"The University provides training, support, advice and information to support effective research data management."
brunel-university-london.md,"Research data management is a shared responsibility. Individual researchers, academic units and central departments work together to develop research data management plans and implement them throughout the research life cycle."
brunel-university-london.md,All research proposals include an integral research data management plan.
brunel-university-london.md,"The University actively supports the collection, storage, retention and cataloguing of all its research data (both raw and published) and promotes its re-use by other researchers where appropriate and with due safeguards."
brunel-university-london.md,"Research data management policies safeguard the interests of participants in the research, the researchers and the University by facilitating compliance with relevant legislation."
brunel-university-london.md,All research data is stored securely and is registered with the University. Data is stored in the data centres of higher educational institutions or in subject-specific data services.
brunel-university-london.md,"All University policies, including those on Intellectual Property, Good Research Practice and the Procedures for Investigation of Research Misconduct, support good practice in research data management."
brunel-university-london.md,"This policy will continue to evolve in line with the changing research environment, in consultation with the research community."
brunel-university-london.md,# Policy
brunel-university-london.md,## Scope of applicability
brunel-university-london.md,"Research data is defined as the evidence base on which academic researchers build their analytic or other work (HEFCE, 2008)."
brunel-university-london.md,"This policy applies in the first instance to academic staff and postgraduate research students (PGRs). It is expected that data generated by undergraduate (UG), postgraduate taught students (PGTs) and non-academic staff in the normal course of study or administration will normally be exempt from this policy, except where any of the following applies:"
brunel-university-london.md,"a. data is generated in connection with an eligible research project, eg funded in whole or in part by Research Councils UK (RCUK), or other public body;"
brunel-university-london.md,"b. the data is generated under a contract of employment with the University, or other agreement (such as a Non-Disclosure/Confidentiality Agreement with a research sponsor / partner;"
brunel-university-london.md,"c. the individual staff member or student has formally published research outputs (conference proceedings, articles, monographs) from the data, in affiliation with Brunel University or jointly-authored with Brunel University staff."
brunel-university-london.md,The terms of this policy will apply in this instance. Staff and students who are uncertain as to whether the policy applies to their situation can contact researchdata@brunel.ac.uk for guidance.
brunel-university-london.md,## Managing research data
brunel-university-london.md,"1. The University will manage research data in accordance with the University's policies, procedures and standards, and statutory and funder requirements."
brunel-university-london.md,"2. Research data generated by academic staff, students on research degrees, and other staff and students where the research activity falls within the scope of this policy, should be managed in accordance with this policy.  (In this policy the term ‘researcher’ shall refer to all these groups of staff and students.)"
brunel-university-london.md,"3. All researchers are expected to familiarise themselves with the University’s policies and guidance in relation to research integrity, including: Intellectual Property, Good Research Practice, Open Access, Research Data Management, Research Ethics. Researchers are required to manage research data in accordance with these."
brunel-university-london.md,"4. Heads of Departments, Directors of Research Institutes or equivalent who have overall responsibility for research staff and students must ensure that all research staff and students are aware of the University's research data management and related policies, procedures and guidelines:"
brunel-university-london.md,5. The Principal Investigator/s or equivalent is responsible for managing compliance with the University and funder research data management policy and requirements during a research project.
brunel-university-london.md,"6. Researchers are expected to create and maintain data management plans for research where research data may be generated. Where no pro-forma has been specified, researchers may use University data management planning templates available from the Research Support and Development Office (RSDO:"
brunel-university-london.md,"7. The University will develop and provide guidance, training and support regarding research"
brunel-university-london.md,"data management: researchdata@brunel.ac.uk See also information on the Library website and RSDO ata ownership 8. Researchers should clarify the ownership of any datasets which are used or generated and of derivative IP for all research projects or ventures generated in collaborations or partnerships, at the proposal stage or by the start of a project.  Researchers are invited to seek advice from: researchdata@brunel.ac.uk 9. Where research data is generated wholly by the researcher, data ownership will normally belong to the University and/or the research funder.  Researchers are invited to seek advice at the proposal stage or by the start of a project from: researchdata@brunel.ac.uk 10. Where all the researchers working on a publicly funded research project are from HE institutions, it is expected that institutional policies will be derived from RCUK policy and expectations and will be similar in principle. While the lead institution and Principal Investigator (PI)will have overall responsibility for ensuring that research data is made available appropriately, and will do so in line with the relevant institutional policy, where this is not Brunel, no conflict with University policy is expected. 11. Where research data is generated in cross-sector collaborations or where third party data is used, data ownership and management can be very complex.  Researchers working within cross-sector collaborations with industry partners should pay particular attention to data ownership and derivative IP generated to ensure that as a minimum, data which underpins a research publication they produce may be published or deposited in an open access data archive.  Researchers are invited to seek advice from University research support services and should contact researchdata@brunel.ac.uk in the first instance. 12. Researchers should abide by the conditions set by the data owner/s, in particular relating to data confidentiality and sharing. Where this is in conflict with University and/or funder policy on data sharing, they should seek guidance from RSDO and/or the Library who will advise further. 13. Ownership information for all data generated or modified should be recorded in the metadata or embedded within datasets as appropriate. 14. Where data ownership must be transferred to a third party, researchers must retain sufficient rights to make research data openly available for reuse, unless this contravenes funder requirements or conditions of data owners. 15. Researchers must not give away exclusive rights to publish, reuse or store research data to third parties, unless doing so is a condition of funding (eg for reasons of confidentiality, research  ethics). If so, researchers should seek advice in the first instance. 16. Researchers who leave the University to work at another HEI while a research project is ongoing may generally expect to retain access to datasets for the duration of the project: each case may need individual consideration as to the most appropriate way to achieve this. RCUK policy takes precedence, and data must be made available alongside any research publications which are published in affiliation with the University.  In some instances, it may be appropriate for data to be transferred, such as where the research project will be moving to another institution.

cardiff-metropolitan-university.md,# Cardiff Metropolitan University Research Data Management Policy
cardiff-metropolitan-university.md,## 1. Introduction
cardiff-metropolitan-university.md,1.1 Cardiff Metropolitan University recognises that the maintenance of accurate and retrievable data arising from the work of its research community is vital to good practice in research conduct.
cardiff-metropolitan-university.md,"1.2 In addition, it is widely accepted that publicly funded research data are a public good which should, wherever possible, be made openly available with as few restrictions as possible in a timely and responsible manner, as set out in RCUK’s Common Principles on Data Policy."
cardiff-metropolitan-university.md,1.3 It is recognised that there is much progress to be made at Cardiff Met in relation to research data management and that it will take time to support and encourage changes in research practice related to the archiving and sharing of research data.
cardiff-metropolitan-university.md,"1.4 This being the case, it is expected that this policy will, in the first instance, be fully adhered to only in relation to externally funded research projects.  It is nonetheless the ultimate aim that all research carried out by staff and students at Cardiff Met will be conducted within the auspices of this policy.  This will be achieved via a phased implementation of a programme of support which will encourage changes in research data management practices across the institution."
cardiff-metropolitan-university.md,## 2. Definitions
cardiff-metropolitan-university.md,"2.1 The institutional Data Management and Governance Policy defines data as distinct units of information such as numbers, letters or symbols, usually formatted in a specific way.  For the purposes of this policy, the term research data is clarified as information gathered through the pursuit of research activity.  Such information may be in a variety of forms including quantitative data, interview recordings or transcripts, video or audio recordings."
cardiff-metropolitan-university.md,## 3. Link to other institutional policies
cardiff-metropolitan-university.md,3.1 This document sets out the overarching policy in relation to research data management at Cardiff Metropolitan University.  It does however link to several other institutional policies and procedures and should therefore be read in conjunction with them.  Of particular significance are:
cardiff-metropolitan-university.md,Open Access Policy
cardiff-metropolitan-university.md,Policy on storage of Research Data

cardiff-metropolitan-university.md,# Cardiff Metropolitan University Research Data Management Policy
cardiff-metropolitan-university.md,"## 4. Storage, retention and sharing of data: expectations"
cardiff-metropolitan-university.md,"4.1 The production of open research data is acknowledged as a legitimate output of the research process. This being the case, research data produced by Cardiff Metropolitan University will be accurate, complete and reliable and every effort will be taken to ensure data are identifiable and retrievable, and openly available where appropriate.  Data shall be stored in a manner compliant with legal and ethical obligations as well as any requirements specific to the funder of the research.  Where issues of confidentiality and/or anonymity arise, these shall be of paramount importance when considering how and where data will be stored and made available."
cardiff-metropolitan-university.md,"4.2 Data will be stored in a secure repository suited to the data set concerned. Where data are stored in an external repository, full details of the location of the data will be registered with the institution and details will be attached to any relevant publications by the Library."
cardiff-metropolitan-university.md,"4.3 Data supporting and underlying published research outputs will, wherever possible, be made available upon publication of the output and will be preserved for an appropriate period.  To enable this, sufficient metadata will be recorded and made available to enable others to understand the research and re-use potential of the data. Published outputs will include information on how to access the supporting data."
cardiff-metropolitan-university.md,"4.4 The minimum period for retention of research data will be ten years from the date of publication.  However where the funder of the research requires a longer retention period, this will be adhered to."
cardiff-metropolitan-university.md,"4.5 Retention periods will be decided as part of the Data Management planning exercise. Once the initial retention period as stated in the Data Management Plan has lapsed, a review will take place to assess whether the data should be retained for a further period.  Data with acknowledged long-term value will be preserved and remain accessible and usable for future research.  Conversely, data which has attracted little interest for more than ten years will not be expected to be retained."
cardiff-metropolitan-university.md,"4.6 The storage of outputs and data derived from undergraduate or taught post graduate research projects will be subject to the expectations of this policy where it is the intention to publish the results of the research.  In cases where there is no intention to publish, the storage of the outputs and data will be governed by the regulatory arrangements of the relevant award."
cardiff-metropolitan-university.md,"4.7 It is recognised that there are instances where it is necessary to restrict access to research data however, any access restrictions placed on data must be justified and justifiable.  It is anticipated that such restrictions will be related to the maintenance of confidentiality, the protection of the privacy of research participants, commercial sensitivity or issues related to IP."
cardiff-metropolitan-university.md,"4.8 Where confidentiality provisions apply, data will be kept in a way that reference to them by third parties can occur without breaching such confidentiality.  Confidentiality agreements to protect intellectual property rights may be agreed between the institution, the researcher and a sponsor of the research. Where such agreements limit free publication and discussion, limitations and restrictions must be explicitly agreed."
cardiff-metropolitan-university.md,# Cardiff Metropolitan University Research Data Management Policy
cardiff-metropolitan-university.md,## 5. Data Management Planning
cardiff-metropolitan-university.md,"5.1 Cardiff Met recognises that, in order for data to be openly discoverable, accessible and useable, the management of data must be considered from the beginning of the research process.  Therefore, in order that issues related to the collection and generation of data are considered at the earliest possible stage, Principal Investigators will develop a Data Management Plan as part of the planning stages of their research project."
cardiff-metropolitan-university.md,"5.2 The Data Management Plan will consider issues related to data collection, storage and backup of data, data preservation and data sharing. Academics will be supported in the development of their Data Management Plan by relevant support staff based in central units and their School or Unit."
cardiff-metropolitan-university.md,## 6. Responsibilities
cardiff-metropolitan-university.md,The development of open research data depends on the ability of all involved to understand their responsibilities and to optimise their own opportunities.
cardiff-metropolitan-university.md,6.2 Cardiff Met expects individual researchers to be responsible for:

carl-von-ossietzky-universität-oldenburg.md,c) for a minimum of ten years after publication.
carl-von-ossietzky-universität-oldenburg.md,### Responsibilities of Researchers
carl-von-ossietzky-universität-oldenburg.md,"Research data should be managed in accordance with the above principles and requirements. The principal investigator of a project is responsible for the data life-cycle. • Clear procedures for the collection, storage, use, re-use, access and retention of the research data should be developed and documented. This information should be incorporated, where appropriate, in a research data management plan (DMP). Such DMP should describe how the collection of data and metadata will be integrated into everyday research processes, so as to make compliance with the DMP as simple as possible. Researchers should plan the ongoing storage of their research data after the completion of the research as to how and where such data will be stored. Appropriate long-term archives include national or international subject-specific archives or a managed university repository."
carl-von-ossietzky-universität-oldenburg.md,"Requirements concerning research data on the part of funding bodies must be met. This includes compliance with publication-ban, -restrictions, or -duty imposed by external contracting bodies, administrative regulations, and federal laws."

central-european-university.md,"The purpose of the CEU Ethical Research Policy is to establish the principles and responsibilities for ethical conduct in research by the members of the CEU community and in research supported by CEU. As a research intensive university, CEU values and protects academic freedom while safeguarding ethical principles in research such as respect for persons and their welfare and justice."
central-european-university.md,"1.  In accordance with its mission, CEU aims to uphold the highest standards of ethics in its research activities including research by the members of the CEU community (students, academic and administrative staff) as well as research supported by CEU (e.g. through research grants, providing facilities, administration, etc.)."
central-european-university.md,2.  CEU also aims to ensure that it does not receive or apply for research funding from inappropriate sources. The Policy and Guidelines on External academic funding at CEU regulates ethical considerations in seeking for and receiving external research funding.
central-european-university.md,"3. CEU is committed to protecting and respecting the privacy of individuals and safeguarding their personal information. When research affects personal data1, the relevant provisions of CEU’s Data Protection Policy of CEU shall also be applied."
central-european-university.md,"4. Each member of the CEU community, persons contracted by CEU (including visiting fellows), grantees and persons/entities performing outsourced research tasks on behalf of CEU or a CEU researcher should adhere to the Ethical Research Guidelines (G-1012-1) which lay out the main principles of ethical research in the social sciences, humanities and other relevant areas. Each of the above mentioned is responsible for identifying ethical issues potentially pertaining to his/her research. In the case of research co-funded or co-hosted by CEU, ethical research guidelines of the co-funding/co-hosting institution might also apply in addition to the provisions determined by CEU Ethical Research Policy."
central-european-university.md,5. The CEU Ethical Research Committee (ERC) will compile a list of other ethical research boards whose reviews are recognized.
central-european-university.md,"6. As an institution, CEU works to keep its community members aware about research ethics."
central-european-university.md,"7. The overall responsibility for ethical research at CEU rests with the President and Rector and the Pro-Rector for Faculty and Research. The Heads of Departments, Programs and Research Centers are responsible for ethical research within their units, including research done by students. The Principal Investigators are responsible for ethical standards in the projects they lead."
central-european-university.md,8. The CEU Ethical Research Committee (ERC) advises the Rector and the Pro-Rector for Faculty and Research on ethical issues pertaining to CEU research and oversees the implementation of CEU Ethical Research Policy and CEU Ethical Research Guidelines. The ERC can introduce minor technical changes into the Ethical Research Policy and the Ethical Research Guidelines.
central-european-university.md,"9. The ERC is chaired by the   Pro-Rector for Faculty and Research or their appointee and includes at least three other members appointed by the Senate, one of whom may be an external academic with experience in handling ethical issues in research. The other members of the committee are chosen from among CEU academic staff members and senior administrative staff members with experience in research ethics in different disciplines. The ERC members are appointed for three years with the possibility of extension for another three-year term. The ERC establishes its own rules of operation (‘Ethical Research Committee: Operational Rules’, Annex 2 to Ethical Research Policy). The minutes of the ERC meetings, excluding the minutes from closed sessions, are available to all members of the CEU community upon request."
central-european-university.md,"10. ERC can delegate responsibilities to appropriately established departmental/research unit Ethical Research Committees, especially when the nature of research within a specific area requires a separate committee. If the character of research makes it necessary, further legally applicable procedures can be followed by departments/research units under the supervision of the ERC or departmental/research unit Ethical Research Committees."
central-european-university.md,"11. Ethical issues in all CEU research should be systematically identified with reference to the Research Ethics Guidelines and the Checklist on Ethical Issues in Research (‘Checklist’, Annex 3 to this Policy). Potential research ethics issues pertaining to research conducted at CEU should be identified, as a first instance, by the researcher(s) involved. Further procedures regarding the identification of ethical issues are specified in Ethical Research Committee: Operational Rules (see: Annex 2 to Ethical Research Policy)."

central-european-university.md,## Annex 1 to the Ethical Research Policy
central-european-university.md,## Ethical research guidelines2
central-european-university.md,The purpose of the CEU Ethical research guidelines is to establish the principles and responsibilities for ethical conduct in research by the members of the CEU Community and in research supported by CEU.
central-european-university.md,### 1. Good Research Practice
central-european-university.md,1.1 Research undertaken in accordance with recognized research ethical principles constitutes good research practice and this guidance should be read in conjunction with the CEU Ethical Research Policy (P-1012-1).
central-european-university.md,"1.2 Upholding recognized ethical principles in research requires an acceptance of and respect for principles of integrity, honesty and openness and a commitment to intellectual honesty and personal responsibility. Research should also aim to benefit society and minimize social harm. Research involving participants must be undertaken to gain knowledge and understanding and avoid unnecessary repetition of existing knowledge."
central-european-university.md,"1.3 Prior to, during and following the completion of research activities, researchers are expected to consider the ethical implications of their research and any of its consequences for the participants involved. Research must be undertaken in accordance with commonly agreed standards of good practice such as those defined in the Declaration of Helsinki and any other guidance or ethical principles of appropriate professional bodies relevant to specific areas of research. Researchers are expected to consider their research from the perspective of the participant."
central-european-university.md,1.4 No member of the CEU community should be compelled or compel others to undertake or participate in research that conflicts with either the researchers’ or the participants’ individual ethical principles.
central-european-university.md,### 2. Scope
central-european-university.md,"2.1 These guidelines must apply to all research conducted under the auspices of the University that involves direct contact with participants, through their physical participation in research activities (invasive and non-invasive participation), that indirectly involves participants through their provision of data and that involves people on behalf of others (e.g. parents on behalf of children)."
central-european-university.md,"2.2 Researchers must be especially sensitive to the need to consider, respect and safeguard the wellbeing of particularly vulnerable participants of research including but not limited to children; those with physiological/psychological impairments; those dependant on the protection or in the care of others and those with limited knowledge of the language in which research is conducted."
central-european-university.md,2.3 These guidelines shall be interpreted in accordance with CEU’s Data Protection Policy which shall prevail in questions related to managing personal data not regulated in this Policy.
central-european-university.md,### 3. Protection of Researcher/Research Team
central-european-university.md,"Some researchers will face a range of potential risks to their safety and the safety of their research team when conducting certain types of research for example a researcher may be required to enter potentially dangerous environments to question certain participants. Such issues need to be considered in the design and conduct of research and procedures must be adopted to minimize any risk to researchers. In addition, researchers must consult all appropriate health and safety guidelines and procedures relevant to their area of research before commencing work."
central-european-university.md,### 4. Protection of Participants.
central-european-university.md,"4.1 Researchers have a responsibility to protect participants from any harm arising from research. Harm to participants may arise from undue stress through participation, loss of self esteem, psychological injury as well as physical harm. As a general rule, people participating in research must not be exposed to risks that are greater than or additional to those they encounter in their normal lifestyles."
central-european-university.md,"4.2 If it is expected that harm, unusual discomfort or other negative consequences might occur in the prospective participant’s future life as a result of participating, the lead researcher must, prior to the person’s participation, obtain written consent of the participants."
central-european-university.md,"4.3 Before participating, people must be informed of procedures for contacting the lead Head of the Ethical Research Committee within a reasonable time, if following participation they experience stress, harm or have related concerns."
central-european-university.md,"4.4 In the case of interviews and questionnaires, the content and line of questioning may be highly sensitive, raise confidential, personal issues and intrude, or be perceived to intrude, upon a participant’s comfort and privacy. The initial judgment on whether or not questions are sensitive and likely to cause harm rests with a lead researcher. Researchers are encouraged to seek advice regarding these issues (for details about advisory bodies at CEU see Annex 2.)."
central-european-university.md,### 5. Obtaining Consent
central-european-university.md,"Researchers should normally carry out investigations with the valid consent of participants having taken all reasonable and practicable steps to ensure that they, or their authorized representatives, have adequately understood the nature of the research and any anticipated consequences. Under no circumstances must coercion be used to obtain a person’s consent to participate in research. Ideally consent should be obtained in writing but where this is not possible oral consent should be obtained."
central-european-university.md,#### 5.1 Informed Consent
central-european-university.md,"5.1.1 Informed consent is a process by which a prospective participant, prior to participating in research:"
central-european-university.md,"(i) Is fully informed about all aspects of the research project, which might reasonably be expected to influence willingness to participate. In addition, the researcher must explain all other aspects of the research about which the prospective participants enquire. Such aspects will include some or all of the following:"
central-european-university.md,• the nature and objectives of the project
central-european-university.md,• the methodology of the project and conditions under which it is to be conducted
central-european-university.md,• the persons/institutions that will have access to personally identifiable information about participants
central-european-university.md,• the form in which research results will be published/communicated (e.g. aggregate statistical form)
central-european-university.md,• who is undertaking and who is sponsoring the project
central-european-university.md,• the potential risks and inconveniences that may arise
central-european-university.md,• the potential benefits that may result • what participation in the research will require
central-european-university.md,"• whether it will be possible, and if yes, until what point, to withdraw from participation (ii) Freely and voluntarily gives consent to participating."
central-european-university.md,"5.1.2 In case where, due to the nature of the research, informed consent is possible only after the researched situation is over, the researchers should obtain the consent as soon as the situation is over and when the participants do not consent the records of the situation should be destroyed in the presence of the participants."
central-european-university.md,"5.1.3 Giving and obtaining consent can be a process, not always a one-off event and participants have the right to change their minds and withdraw consent at any time. However, if the withdrawal of consent occurs at the time when it affects the possibility of the finalization of the research (for instance, shortly before publication or thesis defense), the withdrawal should result only in the deletion of all personally identifiable data of the participant both in published materials and in stored and processed research data. If a researcher doubts whether a person participating in research still consents to participating s/he must clarify this with the person in question."
central-european-university.md,"5.1.4 If the prospective participant is, for any reason, unable to understand the implications of participation, then the researcher is responsible for obtaining the informed consent of the parents/legal guardians of the prospective participant."
central-european-university.md,#### 5.2 Coercion
central-european-university.md,"5.2.1 Where a relationship exists between the researcher and participant (e.g. employees, patients, students or anyone in a dependence relation) careful consideration as to the nature of consent is required. Willingness to volunteer may be unduly influenced by the expectation of benefits or rewards. When research is being conducted with detained persons (e.g. prisoners) particular care must be taken over informed consent, paying particular attention to the special circumstances that may affect the person’s ability to freely and voluntarily give informed consent."
central-european-university.md,5.2.2 People volunteering to participate in research may be paid for their inconvenience and time (taking into account the practices of a given academic discipline). Payments made to individuals must not be so large as to induce the individuals to risk harm beyond that which they would usually undertake. Financial payments might cover reimbursement for travel expenses and / or time. Risks resulting from participation must be acceptable to participants even in the absence of inducement.
central-european-university.md,"5.2.3 The promise of compensation and care for damage, injury or loss of income as a result of participating in research activities to participants should not be considered coercion by inducement."
central-european-university.md,#### 5.3 Research Involving Incompetent Adults
central-european-university.md,"5.3.1 Where a prospective participant is unable to give informed consent to participate a ‘legal representative’ may give assent on his/her behalf (in case of uncertainty the researchers should seek professional advice on the competence of participants). The person unable to give consent should still receive information according to their capacity to understand, setting out the risks and benefits of participating in the research."
central-european-university.md,"5.3.2 In the case of an adult this could be a person designated by the adult, a relative or an independent person nominated by, for example, the hospital at which the research is being undertaken. If the adult has appointed a representative who is available, then this person must be used to give assent. A relative can only be used if the person has not appointed a representative or if the representative is not available. An independent person should only be used if both the adult’s representative and a relative are not available."
central-european-university.md,#### 5.4 Research Involving Children
central-european-university.md,5.4.1 Research involving children exists within both a legal framework and a more traditional context. The following guidance seeks to facilitate research involving children within a legal environment whilst respecting and taking into consideration the traditional and sometimes more formal guidance/procedures many settings may have. Laws of the country where the research takes place should be applied in determining whether participants in the research are children.
central-european-university.md,"5.4.2 Parents (and others with parental responsibility) may agree to their children taking part in research, but where a child is able to understand sufficiently to give informed consent, their consent should be obtained in addition to parents’."
central-european-university.md,"5.4.3 It is the researcher's responsibility to assess whether the child has sufficient understanding to consent to the research. Children’s capacity to consent to research depends on their understanding of the research to be undertaken. Where information about the research and study can be given clearly and simply, it is possible for quite young children to consent to take part in research."
central-european-university.md,"5.4.4 For a child to give valid consent they would need to understand the nature of the engagement with the researcher and understand that it is different to other interactions with those who may seek information from the child. Particularly, the child must be able to understand that the researcher is not able to make decisions about their life, and will use the information the child provides, but not in a way which would allow others to identify the child."
central-european-university.md,5.4.5 Where a researcher wishes to include children in a study whom he/she considers is not mature enough to decide about participation he/she must obtain the agreement of at least one person who has parental responsibility for the child before engaging them in any research activity.
central-european-university.md,"5.4.6 Where children are considered competent by a researcher to participate they should be accorded the confidentiality as would an adult. There are however two areas of concern where the same level of confidentially cannot be promised to a child: where a child discloses that they are being seriously harmed or ill-treated, or where the researcher discovers a condition about which the parents could take action to benefit the child. In these instances researchers could be seen to have a duty of care to disclose such information to relevant third parties."
central-european-university.md,"5.4.7 In the case of research in educational settings, any special school policies or procedures must be followed and efforts made to fully inform those responsible for children in these settings of the purpose and benefits of any proposed research with children."
central-european-university.md,#### 5.5 Research in Public Contexts and With Groups
central-european-university.md,5.5.1 In certain types of research obtaining consent from every individual participating is impractical or unfeasible (e.g. observing a large crowd or observing discussions on the internet). In such types of research researchers must ensure the following:
central-european-university.md,(i) That such research is only carried out in public contexts;
central-european-university.md,(ii) That no details that could identify specific individuals are given in any reports on the research unless reporting on public figures acting in their public capacity (e.g. reporting a speech by a named individual);
central-european-university.md,"(iii) That unless those observed give their consent to be observed, observational research should only occur where those observed would expect to be observed by strangers."
central-european-university.md,5.5.2 The privacy and psychological well-being of people participating in observational research and people participating in research activities in which a researcher may actually be acting as a fellow
central-european-university.md,"participant, for example as part of a wider group, must be respected. In such group based, participatory research activities the usual effort should be made to ensure that the group leader(s), or others in positions of responsibility, as well as other individuals of a group, are made aware that they participate in their activities with research purposes. If this ""open strategy"" is not pursued, the researcher must be able to make an explicit and convincing case why this was not done."
central-european-university.md,"5.5.3 It is recognized that in certain types of observational research or organizational settings it may be more difficult to explain to people participating their right to withdraw at any stage. However, in such types of research, researchers are expected to make a reasonable attempt to do so."
central-european-university.md,#### 5.6 Research Involving Deception
central-european-university.md,"5.6.1 In certain research disciplines (e.g. psychology), to ensure the viability of a piece of research, it is sometimes necessary to withhold information on the true objectives of the research from the people participating in it. In such types of research it is impossible to obtain informed consent from the participants. Wherever possible such research should be avoided and the Ethical Research Committee will pay particular attention to research involving deception. Where deception or the misleading of participants is considered necessary, the central principle to consider when deciding the ethical soundness of deception is the anticipated reaction of the participant once debriefed. If it is likely that the participant will be angry, or show unease once debriefed the research is likely to be deemed unacceptable."
central-european-university.md,"5.6.2 However, when such research, requiring consent but not informed consent from participants, is judged to be necessary for the results of the research to be valid, researchers must exercise particular caution. In such circumstances the lead researcher has a special responsibility to: (i) Justify that alternative procedures to avoid the withholding of information or deliberate deception are not available and, if available, are not feasible for the research; (ii) Justify why the withholding of information, or an element of concealment or deception, is integral to the viability of the research."
central-european-university.md,#### 5.7 Research Involving Personal Data
central-european-university.md,"In all cases where personal data is collected, recorded, used, or managed in any other way during research, the relevant privacy rules of CEU’s Data Protection Policy shall be followed, as applicable."
central-european-university.md,### 6. Debriefing
central-european-university.md,Debriefing does not provide a justification for unethical aspects of research but is rather a means for researchers to discuss with participants their experience of the research and to monitor any unforeseen negative effects or misconceptions. Debriefing is particularly important where any form of deception has been used and researchers have a responsibility to ensure that participants have received any necessary debriefing in the form of active intervention before they leave the research setting.
central-european-university.md,### 7. Research conducted in cross-cultural contexts
central-european-university.md,"7.1 Researchers should bear in mind the differences between civil, legal and often the financial positions of national and foreign researchers and participants and must be aware that there may be a number of national laws which can affect the conduct of their research. 7.2 Researchers should endeavour to balance professional integrity with respect for national and international law in the context of their research."
central-european-university.md,7.3 Researchers should endeavour to ensure that research is conducted with respect for underrepresented social groups and that attempts are made to avoid their marginalization or exclusion. 7.4 Researchers should endeavour to ensure that the concerns of relevant stakeholders and user groups are addressed.
central-european-university.md,"### 8. Confidentiality, Anonymity and Privacy"
central-european-university.md,"8.1 The collection, storage, disclosure and use of personal data by researchers must comply with all legislation relating to data protection and arrangements must be put in place by researchers to carefully protect the confidentiality of participants and their data. Details that would allow individuals to be identified must not be published or made available to anybody not involved in the research unless explicit consent is given by the individuals concerned."
central-european-university.md,"8.2 Before consent is obtained, researchers must inform prospective participants of:"
central-european-university.md,(i) Risks regarding the confidentiality of personal data and data revealed during research when the information is gathered in the presence of other participants (e.g. focus groups);
central-european-university.md,(ii) Any potential risks that might mean that the confidentiality or anonymity of personal data may not be guaranteed;
central-european-university.md,"(iii) Which individuals and organizations, if any, will be permitted access to personal data, and under what circumstances such access will be granted;"
central-european-university.md,(iv) The purpose for which personal information provided is to be used (e.g. if video material might be used for teaching purposes).
central-european-university.md,"8.3 If it is necessary, in undertaking research, to identify participants explicitly, then the researchers must explain why this is the case and how confidentiality will be protected. Researchers must be aware of the risks to anonymity, confidentiality and privacy posed by all kinds of personal information storage and processing which directly identify a person (e.g. audio and videotapes, electronic and paper-based files, e-mail records). 3 Measures to prevent accidental breaches of confidentiality must be taken, and in cases where confidentiality is threatened, relevant records should be destroyed. Provisions for data security at the end of a project must be made."
central-european-university.md,"8.4 Guarantees of confidentiality and anonymity given to research participants must be honored, unless there are clear and overriding reasons to inform appropriate third parties (e.g. cases of child abuse, where an uninvolved 3rd party may be at risk through the participant’s actions or where a possibility of the participant’s self-harm is revealed during the research). All participants have the right to access personal information, whether or not it is confidential, that relates to them, and to be provided with a copy of the information on request (all participants have to be made aware of the process and researcher(s) responsible for providing the information). People should have the right, following the completion of their period of involvement in the research and following discussions with the researcher, to withdraw their consent and to require that their own data be destroyed, if practicable and unless the withdrawal jeopardizes the research at its final stages (see also: 5.1.2)."
central-european-university.md,### 9. Funding from External Sources
central-european-university.md,"9.1 CEU supports and encourages its staff to seek external funding for their research activities and accepts funding for research from a wide and diverse portfolio of legal sources, in accordance with University financial regulations and ethical research principles laid down in CEU Ethical Research Policy (P-1012-1) and in this document. All applications and proposals made, and contracts and awards accepted relating to external research funding, are done so on behalf of and in the name of CEU."
central-european-university.md,"9.2 However, it is recognized that there may be circumstances where ethical issues can arise when considering whether or not to apply for or accept funding for research from particular sources. It is important that the interests of all CEU community members and the interests and the reputation of the University as a whole are safeguarded when seeking and accepting external funding."
central-european-university.md,9.3 The principles and procedures for considering ethical issues when applying for external research funding are laid out in the Policy on External Funding for Academic Activities at CEU (P0805- 01v1202).

central-european-university.md,## Annex 2 to the Ethical Research Policy
central-european-university.md,### Ethical Research Committee: Operational Rules
central-european-university.md,"All research at CEU (by members of CEU community and research supported by CEU) is expected to accord with recognized ethical research principles. Two CEU official documents safeguard that the expectations are met – CEU Ethical Research Policy and CEU Ethical Research Guidelines, the first of which specifies general principles and responsibilities related to ethical research while the second lays down the specific principles that the researcher(s) must abide by in their study."
central-european-university.md,This annex regulates the operation of the CEU Ethical Research Committee and procedures that researchers at CEU need to observe regarding the evaluation and review of their research.
central-european-university.md,### Rules of Operation of ERC
central-european-university.md,#### 1. Decisions
central-european-university.md,Quorum is two-thirds; decisions by ERC are taken by simple majority.
central-european-university.md,2. Raising awareness on ethical issues in research
central-european-university.md,"(a) All academic staff members whose research can involve ethical issues, and staff members directly involved in administering such research, are required to undertake an online research ethics training and familiarization module, identified by the ERC, once every five years."
central-european-university.md,"(b) Some academic disciplines require that ethical research training be a part of standard academic training in the discipline. The heads of CEU departments/research centers/schools report to the Chair of the ERC on the issue as necessary. In cases where ethical research training is part of the expected and practiced skills of the discipline, researchers from the department need not complete the ethical research training.  These researchers are however encouraged to undertake the online research ethics training module as a way of renewing their existing skills set."
central-european-university.md,"(d) Students whose work involves ethical issues and who do not receive adequate training on these issues in other form, e.g. as part of their courses are also asked to complete the training (see also below in 5.1)."
central-european-university.md,#### 3. Persons/bodies at CEU with a responsibility to identify ethical issues in research
central-european-university.md,"The ERC constitutes the highest instance regarding the identification of ethical issues and ethical review of research at CEU. In addition, the following persons/bodies may be involved in the identification/review process:"
central-european-university.md,#### 3.1 Master’s/PhD Dissertations/Research:
central-european-university.md,Academic supervisors;
central-european-university.md,Heads of Departments/Programs;
central-european-university.md,Academic program committees (e.g. Departmental Doctoral Committees); specialized Ethical Research Committees4;
central-european-university.md,Dissertation committees;
central-european-university.md,3.2 Research conducted by/headed by Academic Staff Members:
central-european-university.md,Principal researcher(s) responsible for a research project;
central-european-university.md,Heads of Academic Units;
central-european-university.md,Specialized Ethical Research Committees;
central-european-university.md,Academic Cooperation and Research Support Office (ACRO);
central-european-university.md,#### 4. Identification of ethical research issues and the need for a review
central-european-university.md,"(a) The Checklist on Ethical Issues in Research is the basic instrument in identifying ethical issues. It is strongly advised that researchers use the Checklist as a guide for the research already in its designing/planning stage, so that possible violations of Ethical Research Policy and Ethical Research Guidelines are avoided."
central-european-university.md,"(b) Every researcher at CEU should, before signing a contract with CEU, receive all the relevant documents relating to ethical issues in research (Ethical Research Policy, Ethical Research Guidelines, Operational Rules of the ERC, the Checklist on Ethical Issues in Research). All contracts signed with CEU should contain a clause: “I have received all the relevant documents related to the ethical issues in research and will abide by the rules laid down in these documents”."
central-european-university.md,#### 4.1 Master’s/PhD Dissertations
central-european-university.md,(a) Identification of ethical research issues in Master’s thesis/PhD dissertation projects is the responsibility of the student and his/her supervisor(s).
central-european-university.md,"The following are applicable only if any ethical research issue is identified in the thesis/: (b) Unless there is another well-established disciplinary practice of addressing ethical issues in research, students and supervisors are advised to consult and use the Checklist on Ethical Issues in Research as a basis of identifying and addressing ethical issues."
central-european-university.md,"(c) If there are research ethics issues involved in the student’s work, supervisors should make sure that the student receives some form of training in this field. The training could be a component of research or methods courses which are part of the curriculum.  Supervisors or Academic Unit Heads may wish to ask students to complete the online ethical research training module described in Point 2 in lieu of ethical research training in the Unit.  ."
central-european-university.md,(d) Departments/Programs may decide to make the submission and discussion of a completed Checklist a Prospectus Seminar requirement for thesis/dissertations/research proposals in which ethical issues were identified. It is within the authority of Departmental/Programs’ authorities to make the Checklist on Ethical Issues in Research an integral part of the dissertation.
central-european-university.md,(e) Departmental/Program Committees may conduct random checks of dissertations and student work in progress with regards to the identification of ethical issues and reviews with regards to the compliance with Ethical Research Guidelines.
central-european-university.md,#### 4.2 Research conducted by academic staff
central-european-university.md,"(a) Identification of ethical research issues in research projects is the responsibility of the principal researcher(s) of the project. If potential issues are identified, the Checklist on Ethical Issues in Research should be completed and filed so that it can be produced upon request by the ERC. If there are no ethical issues, there is no need to fill in the Checklist."
central-european-university.md,(b) Researchers may request consultations with other persons/bodies at CEU on ethical research issues in the order indicated in ‘Research by Academic Staff Members’ of section 3.2 above
central-european-university.md,"(c) The ERC may conduct random ethical reviews of research projects. In those cases, the principal investigator(s) should produce the Checklist and all other relevant material for review as required. The specialised Committees appointed can also conduct random reviews in their field."
central-european-university.md,"(d) All research projects by the CEU academic staff which receive either external funding or targeted funding from CEU should file a completed Checklist with the ACRO if ethical issues are identified in the project. In accordance with Point (c) above, the ERC may conduct random checks on these projects."
central-european-university.md,"(e) If a research proposal fails to meet ethical standards required, the funding of the project may be refused or suspended. (g) When an external funding body requires an ethical research review of the research project, ACRO upon completing the documents forwards the request to the ERC for review."
central-european-university.md,#### 5. Review process
central-european-university.md,"(a) For review purposes, ERC maintains a list of potential reviewers, updated at the beginning of every academic year, both from among CEU academic staff members and academics not affiliated with CEU, with expertise relevant for determining issues in research ethics."
central-european-university.md,"(b) Researchers applying for the ethical research review by ERC should submit the research proposal, the Checklist on Ethical Issues in Research, with the section on requesting a review filled in as appropriate, to the Chair of the ERC at least two months before the commencement of the research. The results of the review should be communicated to the researcher(s) in time for the start of the research."
central-european-university.md,(c) The Chair of the ERC will ask a member of the Committee to recommend reviewers for the proposal. The Committee member proposes two persons from the list of reviewers and/or from among the members of the ERC to serve as reviewers. The reviewers are asked to check the compliance of the research project with ethical standards.
central-european-university.md,"(d) The review reports are submitted to the Chair of the ERC, and if amendments are proposed by the reviewers, these are conveyed to the applicant. Research proposals can be amended twice, and if necessary, reviewers are asked to check if amendments sufficiently address the concerns raised."
central-european-university.md,"(e) The Chair of the ERC makes a decision about the acceptance or refusal of proposals, taking into account the reviewers’ opinion and the compliance of the applicants with suggestions to amend the project."
central-european-university.md,"(f) If continued supervision of the project is needed then, when possible, one of the reviewers is appointed and when not, the Chair of the ERC appoints a supervisor from the list of potential reviewers."
central-european-university.md,"(g) In the case that an ethical research review is carried out by another Committee, to which such responsibilities had been delegated by the ERC in line with Point 10 of the Ethical Research Policy, the researchers have a responsibility to notify the Chair of the ERC and file the review results with ACRO."

christian-albrechts-university-zu-kiel.md,University Board Resolution of 14 July 20151
christian-albrechts-university-zu-kiel.md,"Research data are the basis and result of scientific work and are therefore of particular significance. It is important to handle research data responsibly to ensure that scientific work is traceable, verifiable and reusable. Handling research data is subject to constant change due to advances in research. Kiel University continuously assists with this ongoing process by implementing appropriate measures. Accordingly, appropriate subject-specific handling of research data at Kiel University should follow these principles:"
christian-albrechts-university-zu-kiel.md,"1. Research data are all data created in the process of research work through observation, collection, experiments, simulation, and further processing for the purpose of producing and validating research results. Research data management, therefore, covers all areas of data administration: data acquisition, data preservation, data security and data integrity, as well as the release and publication of data."
christian-albrechts-university-zu-kiel.md,2. Research data management is performed in accordance with current professional standards while respecting the DFG (German Research Foundation) proposals for safeguarding good scientific practice and is documented in a data management plan. The responsibility for research data management lies with the head of the particular research activity.
christian-albrechts-university-zu-kiel.md,"3. Research data is made accessible to the public in national or international subjectspecific archives under appropriate licensing; if no such archives exist, central university services are used. The scientific and legal interests of the researchers, the protection of the personal details of participants, patients and other individuals affected by the collected data, as well as other obligations to third parties – for example, cooperation partners – as well as ethical, legal and economic restrictions must be observed."
christian-albrechts-university-zu-kiel.md,"Kiel University assists researchers through its central infrastructure facilities with offers for acquisition and preservation of research data, formulating and maintaining standards for handling research data, as well as appropriate training and advisory service offers created in cooperation with the specialist disciplines. Kiel University recommends and assists with anchoring the significance of subject-specific, structured research data management in teaching by the particular subject areas."

de-montfort-university.md,## INTRODUCTION
de-montfort-university.md,"1. De Montfort University is committed to research excellence and integrity and seeks to promote high standards of research data management throughout the research data lifecycle.  The University is working towards compliance with the principles of the UK Concordat on Open Research Data and believes that making data ‘as open as possible, as closed as necessary’ (European Commission FAIR Data Guidelines 2016) is key to research transparency, integrity and engagement."
de-montfort-university.md,"2. This document sets out our policy on Open Research Data and on the management of data in the research lifecycle in accordance with funder requirements, and supersedes and replaces DMU’s ‘Guidelines for Managing Research Data’. It should be read alongside the following policies:"
de-montfort-university.md,Guidelines for Good Research Practice Policy on Conducting Sensitive Research Data Protection DMU Figshare Terms & Conditions Faculty-specific Guidelines for Research Ethics
de-montfort-university.md,## SCOPE
de-montfort-university.md,"3. This policy applies to all DMU staff who undertake academic research, as well as postgraduate research students, external consultants, visitors and contractors conducting research at or on behalf of the University (collectively referred to as ‘DMU researchers’), whether externally funded or not, unless otherwise indicated."
de-montfort-university.md,"4. The term ‘research data’ refers to the evidence that underpins the answer to the research question and can be used to validate findings, regardless of its form (e.g. print, digital or physical).  These might include quantitative information or qualitative statements collected by researchers in the course of their work by experimentation, observation, modelling, interview or other methods, or information derived from existing evidence. They may include (but are not limited to) statistics, collections of digital images, sound recordings, transcripts of interviews, survey data, fieldwork notes, artwork, archives, found objects, published texts or manuscripts.  The primary purpose of research data is to provide the information necessary to support or validate a research project’s observations, findings or outputs (Concordat on Open Research Data, 2016)."
de-montfort-university.md,"5. Open research data are those research data that can be freely accessed, used, modified and shared, provided that there is appropriate acknowledgement, where required (Concordat on Open Research Data, 2016)."
de-montfort-university.md,"6. All research data created by DMU researchers are the intellectual property of the University, unless subject to a grant, contract or other legally binding agreement signed by the University that stipulates otherwise.  For the avoidance of doubt, where legislative requirements apply, those legislative requirements will take precedence over this policy."
de-montfort-university.md,"7. All new research proposals for external funding must include research data management plans or protocols (DMPs) in line with the relevant funders’ policies (bearing in mind that some funders may require a DMP to be in place even if they do not ask for it to be submitted to them).  DMPs are also encouraged for research that is not externally funded, in order to enable cross-checking and validation, and support research integrity.  Additionally, it may be the case that individual Faculty Ethics Committees might require a DMP to be submitted with ethics applications."
de-montfort-university.md,"8. All DMPs should include responsibilities for data collection, documentation and metadata, ethical and legal compliance, storage and backup, selection of data of long-term value, preservation and data sharing."
de-montfort-university.md,"9. DMPs should ensure that research data are available for access and re-use wherever appropriate and with appropriate safeguards. For example, where the openness of data is restricted as outlined in sections 16 and 17, it may be that metadata is still made available and data sharing for re-use agreed with specific individuals/organisations under an appropriate legal agreement such as a data sharing agreement or a non-disclosure agreement. This would need to be detailed in the DMP."
de-montfort-university.md,"10. All research data of continuing value to the researcher and/or wider research community, or specified by funding bodies or publishers, or required for legal or other regulatory purposes, must be made openly available unless restrictions apply (see sections 16 and 17)."
de-montfort-university.md,"a. In the case of digital data, this may be achieved by depositing data to a specific domain repository (see section 11 below), or to the University data repository at"
de-montfort-university.md,"b. In the case of non-digital data, this may be achieved by digitising the data and treating it as digital data, or by storing the data, e.g. with DMU Library Special Collections (the University's archive service) and recording the metadata on the University data repository at   including details of how to access the data."
de-montfort-university.md,"11.It is recognised that the most appropriate location for making data open may be a specific domain repository.  This may be because a funder requires it (e.g. UK Data Service for ESRC-funded research), or because it is the most appropriate for a particular discipline (e.g. Archaeology Data Service).  Data should be deposited in the most appropriate repository, and metadata recorded and made openly available via the University data repository at"
de-montfort-university.md,"12. To enable research data to be discoverable and effectively re-used by others, sufficient metadata should be recorded and made openly available via the University data repository ("
de-montfort-university.md,"13. Research data that may be of future historical interest, including data that substantiate research findings, should normally be offered and assessed for deposit and retention in an appropriate data service, domain repository, the University data repository or (in the case of non-digital material) with DMU Library Special Collections (the University's archive service)."
de-montfort-university.md,"14. The legitimate interests of the subjects of research data, and future historical interests, must be protected, e.g. in accordance with data protection laws, research ethics, human rights and duty of confidence."
de-montfort-university.md,"15. Where a funding body, publisher or their agent requests exclusive rights to publish or re-use University research data without any assurance that it will be made openly available upon publication, the University’s default position will be to refuse such a request, unless required to grant such rights as part of the terms and conditions of a grant, or under a legal obligation."
de-montfort-university.md,"16. Where any research is subject to any associated contractual arrangements and/or grant conditions that conflict with this policy, the provisions of such contractual arrangements and/or grant conditions will take precedence."
de-montfort-university.md,17.It is recognised that there are sound reasons why the openness of research data may need to be restricted.  For example (but not limited to) the following:
de-montfort-university.md,a. where individuals’ legitimate interests would be compromised (e.g. under the Data Protection Act);
de-montfort-university.md,b. where data is commercially sensitive;
de-montfort-university.md,c. where intellectual property rights do not permit;
de-montfort-university.md,d. where the investment of time/money/resources would be disproportionate to the anticipated benefits to the University and/or research community.
de-montfort-university.md,"18. These are decisions that individual researchers should look at on a case by case basis, for each dataset, and (where the project is funded) may have to justify their decision to the research funder."
de-montfort-university.md,"19.It is recognised that DMU researchers who generate original data must have reasonable right of exclusive first use for an appropriate and well-defined period, which may vary by subject and discipline area. They may, therefore, wish to set an embargo on the publication of their data. This should be considered from the earliest stages of project planning and set out in the Data Management Plan."
de-montfort-university.md,20. DMU researchers are required to comply with the conditions of their research funders’ data management policies.
de-montfort-university.md,"21. Responsibility for the creation of a DMP (where required), the updating of that plan, and the implementation of the plan throughout the research lifecycle during any research project or  programme lies with the PI or most senior DMU researcher associated with the project."
de-montfort-university.md,22. All research data (through funded or unfunded projects) must be assigned a ‘Data Steward’.  This will normally be the most senior DMU researcher associated with the Project to which the dataset relates.  The ‘Data Steward’ is responsible for ensuring the requirements of this policy are met and is the named contact for any enquiries about the data.
de-montfort-university.md,"23. Where the research is part of a collaborative project led by an external partner, it is the responsibility of the most senior DMU researcher associated with the project to ensure that DMU is able to meet the requirements of this policy and to keep a copy of any DMP and other data agreements."
de-montfort-university.md,"24. When undertaking research projects in collaboration with other institutions, organisations or individuals, DMU researchers should ensure that ownership and copyright of data generated and/or shared is specified in a data sharing agreement which sets out clearly the obligations and permissions of each party with regard to the data."
de-montfort-university.md,"25.It is the responsibility of researchers to discuss with the relevant departments (e.g. ITMS, Library and Learning Services) whether there will be any cost to their project for the storage (including server patches), backup, deposit and retention of the project research data; and to ensure, before starting their research project, that any costs during the life of the project and after can be covered."
de-montfort-university.md,26.It is the responsibility of the researcher to handle personal data lawfully and according to DMU’s internal data management procedures and according to the General Data Protection Regulation and Data Protection Act 2018.
de-montfort-university.md,"27.It should be the default position that personal data cannot be treated as open data unless fully anonymised. However, it is accepted that in rare circumstances exceptions may need to be made, for example, with regard to oral history. Personal data should not be treated as open data in an un-anonymised form unless agreed by Research Services and, if necessary, by the Information Governance team."
de-montfort-university.md,"28. DMU researchers should, where possible, include costs for storing and making data open in external funding applications."
de-montfort-university.md,"29. Faculty Associate Deans for Research, Institute Directors and others responsible for research-active staff and students should ensure that DMU researchers in their areas are aware of the University’s policy regarding research data management and its associated guidelines and procedures."
de-montfort-university.md,"30. DMU researchers should ensure published results always include information on how to access the supporting data.  Where data supporting publications is made open, it should be accessible by the publication date and in citeable format."
de-montfort-university.md,31. All ‘external DMU researchers’ agree to indemnify DMU in full for any legal costs incurred by DMU in relation to any legal action taken by DMU against any breach of this policy and or any policy mentioned within this policy.
de-montfort-university.md,## DMU’S RESPONSIBILITIES
de-montfort-university.md,"32. The University will provide access to training, support, advice and where appropriate, guidelines and templates for research data management and data management plans."
de-montfort-university.md,"33. The University will provide the infrastructure for the storage, backup, deposit and retention of research data in support of current and future access, during and after completion of research projects.  This may be charged to the research project (see paragraph 17)."
de-montfort-university.md,## ENFORCEMENT
de-montfort-university.md,"34. In the event of any breach of this policy and any policy mentioned within this policy, by any ‘DMU researchers’ (as defined above) or ‘external DMU researchers’, DMU reserves the right to take appropriate legal action."

edinburgh-napier-university.md,# Edinburgh Napier University Research Data Management Policy
edinburgh-napier-university.md,## Introduction/Rationale
edinburgh-napier-university.md,"Edinburgh Napier University (the University) is committed to delivering excellent research and, as research data is at the very core of evidencing research quality and integrity, it is vital that robust research data management,  open data policies and procedures are in place to ensure that research conducted by, and under the auspices of, Edinburgh Napier University meets the highest standards to comply with legislative, regulatory, audit, funding body, partner (stakeholder) and internal requirements."
edinburgh-napier-university.md,"This policy underlines the University’s commitment to the Universities UK Concordats on open research data and research integrity, by highlighting the importance of the management of research data to good governance and best practice."
edinburgh-napier-university.md,"Further to this, in line with the UK and Scottish Government’ research funders (such as UK Research and Innovation, Horizon Europe and UK research charities) commitment to open data and to ensuring that the outputs from research are freely accessible, the University requires research data to be managed efficiently and effectively to facilitate such use, sharing and publication as appropriate to ensure the maximum benefit is derived from any research undertaken under its auspices."
edinburgh-napier-university.md,# Scope of Policy
edinburgh-napier-university.md,This policy applies to all researchers and support staff employed to conduct research and innovation activities under the auspices of the University and to all research data regardless of how it is funded. It includes research undertaken by research postgraduate students.
edinburgh-napier-university.md,"This policy covers all data, information and records created, received, and maintained during research activities, in any format whether physical and electronic. These might be quantitative information or qualitative statements collected by researchers in the course of their work by experimentation, observation, modelling, interview or other methods, or information derived from existing evidence. Data may be raw or primary (e.g. direct from measurement or collection) or derived from primary data for subsequent analysis or interpretation (e.g. cleaned up or as an extract from a larger data set) or derived from existing sources where the rights may be held by others."
edinburgh-napier-university.md,"They may include statistics, instrument measurements, collections of digital images, sound or video recordings, transcripts of interviews, survey data and fieldwork observations with appropriate annotations, an interpretation, an artwork, archives, found objects, published texts or manuscripts, simulation data, models & software, slides, physical artefacts, specimens, samples, questionnaires, sketches, diaries, lab notebooks, social media data, etc."
edinburgh-napier-university.md,## Policy Aims and Objectives

edinburgh-napier-university.md,• To promote open access to research data to support collaboration;
edinburgh-napier-university.md,• To ensure that the University fully complies with the requirements of specific funding bodies.
edinburgh-napier-university.md,## Policy Statement
edinburgh-napier-university.md,"All research data created during research and innovation activities, whether internally, unfunded, or externally funded, must be created, received, and maintained in accordance with associated policies and procedures and as defined in ENU’s Responsibilities guidelines."
edinburgh-napier-university.md,"A Research Data Management plan (DMP) or a declaration stating no data will be generated must be submitted as part of the project proposal for ALL research projects. The DMP must adhere to the requirements of the University using templates and guidance provided by the University, whether or not required by external funding bodies. Where specifically required by funding bodies, the Research Data Management Plan must meet the requirements of both the University and funding bodies."
edinburgh-napier-university.md,"Intellectual property, copyright and/or rights to re-use/share the data remain with the University (as per the Intellectual Property policy) unless otherwise dictated by the funding body and agreed by the University."
edinburgh-napier-university.md,"If researchers/employees leave the University, data and records relating to any research conducted under the auspices of the University remain the property of the University. Remaining data files should be assigned a data custodian responsible for the management or the data."
edinburgh-napier-university.md,"Where the Principal Investigator and the grant transfer to another institution during a project, the University will normally accord the rights for the data and records generated up to that time to transfer as an integral part of the research but will retain a copy as part of its own research record."
edinburgh-napier-university.md,New employees bringing with them existing research contracts are required to comply with the University’s policy on research data and records from the commencement of their employment.
edinburgh-napier-university.md,"Edinburgh Napier University Research Data Management Policy April 2015, Revision March 2022"
edinburgh-napier-university.md,## Responsibilities
edinburgh-napier-university.md,"The most senior Edinburgh Napier University researcher associated with a research project is the Principal Investigator, unless specified otherwise on the funding application, for that project and is ultimately responsible for research data management and planning including making research data open."
edinburgh-napier-university.md,"In the case of a PhD project, the Director of Studies is responsible. It is their duty to ensure that all members of the research team with access to the research data adhere to good research data management practice."
edinburgh-napier-university.md,"In the case of collaborative projects, if the Principal Investigator is based elsewhere, the lead researcher at Edinburgh Napier University must take responsibility for all data generated here."
edinburgh-napier-university.md,"Throughout the lifecycle of the research data, researchers and support staff involved in the management of the data must ensure that the following principles are adhered to in order to achieve the objective of the capture and maintenance of authentic, reliable, open and re-useable data:"
edinburgh-napier-university.md,"1. Researchers must comply with funder data management requirements and are responsible for making themselves familiar with and adhering to legislation (including data protection and trusted research), contractual obligations and funder policies governing their research data."
edinburgh-napier-university.md,2. Ensure they undertake training and cognisance of the guidance and support as offered by the University.
edinburgh-napier-university.md,3. Seek to recover the direct costs of managing research data from the research funder where possible.
edinburgh-napier-university.md,4. Researchers must ensure that active research data are stored securely and protected from loss. University approved systems such as the University networked storage system must be used for storing research data in both original and processed formats. The University has created a central research data file store for this purpose and will provide advice on technical solutions for research data storage and archiving.
edinburgh-napier-university.md,"5. Ensure that Metadata describing the structure and content of the data is routinely created and updated, whether manually or automatically, for project continuity purposes in line with University metadata standards and conventions guidance. At the end of the project, researchers will ensure that appropriately structured metadata describing the research data they hold is published (normally within 12 months of the data being generated) and made freely accessible on the internet."
edinburgh-napier-university.md,"6. Ensure data is stored for a period at least as long as that required by any funder or sponsor of the research. Research data must be retained after project completion if they substantiate research findings, are of potential long-term value or support a patent for at least 10 years."
edinburgh-napier-university.md,"7. Ensure research data that have been selected for retention are made openly available with as few restrictions as possible, unless this would breach legislative, regulatory, contractual, ethical or other obligations, or where the cost of doing so"
edinburgh-napier-university.md,"would be prohibitive. Wherever possible, potential restrictions on data should be described in the project’s data management plan."
edinburgh-napier-university.md,"8. Register all research data to be openly discoverable with the repository within the University Research Management System, Worktribe, whether they are hosted by the University or maintained elsewhere, even if access to the data is restricted. It is important that the metadata is open even if the datasets themselves cannot be made freely available to comply with FAIR data requirements (Findable, accessible, interoperable and reproducible)."
edinburgh-napier-university.md,9. Where you are not sure if data can be made available or if the data is restricted and there are concerns about a data access request you should contact RDM@napier.ac.uk  for advice and if necessary to convene the University research data access committee to consider whether it is appropriate to share closed data with another organisation.
edinburgh-napier-university.md,"10. Datasets deposited in the repository should be accompanied with a readme file. A readme file provides information about a data file and is intended to help ensure that the data can be correctly interpreted, by yourself at a later date or by others when sharing or publishing data."
edinburgh-napier-university.md,11. Those who have contributed to the collection and analysis should be acknowledged in the dataset/output record eg contribution tab in output record in Worktribe or through CRediT when available in external systems.
edinburgh-napier-university.md,12. Datasets should be assigned a digital object identifier or DOI (the library can provide on request) and other persistent identifiers such as ORCIDs and grant IDs wherever possible and apply appropriate creative commons licenses to clarify ownership and use of data.
edinburgh-napier-university.md,"13. Ensure published research outputs reporting publicly funded research include a data access statement. This is a short statement describing how and on what terms any supporting research data or underlying research materials may be accessed. Underlying research materials are research data as defined in the Concordat on Open Research Data and can include code, software, numerical scores, textual records, images, sounds, objects and manuscripts. A data access statement should be provided on outputs, even where there are no data associated with the article or the data are inaccessible."
edinburgh-napier-university.md,14. Ensure exclusive rights to re-use or publish research data are not handed over to commercial publishers or agents without retaining the rights to make the data openly available for re-use unless this is a condition of funding.
edinburgh-napier-university.md,### Principal Investigators (PIs)
edinburgh-napier-university.md,PIs have primary responsibility for:
edinburgh-napier-university.md,"• Ensuring that a robust DMP plan is in place, prior to the start of the project (ideally at project planning/application stage) which is implemented and maintained throughout the course of the research project."

eth-zurich.md,"3 Applicable national and international law always takes precedence (e.g. personal data protection, export control of dual-use technology, archiving, copyright).12"
eth-zurich.md,#### Art. 2   Scope
eth-zurich.md,"1 These guidelines apply to all members (including academic guests)13 of ETH Zurich involved in scientific research (hereinafter ""researchers"")."
eth-zurich.md,"2 The present guidelines complement and do not supersede regulations issued by Swiss, European and international funding agencies, which prevail in case of any discrepancies."
eth-zurich.md,"3 In research projects financed by commercial and/or private third parties, the guidelines should be taken into account when negotiating conditions with partners and should be followed as far as possible within the contractual obligations."
eth-zurich.md,"4 Within the context of academic research cooperation that extends beyond ETH Zurich, researchers of ETH Zurich involved are responsible for compliance with these guidelines."
eth-zurich.md,#### Art. 3   Definitions
eth-zurich.md,1 Research Data are all data that the relevant scientific community accepts as necessary for validating research findings (based on Article 10 of the Integrity Guidelines).14
eth-zurich.md,2 Metadata are data that provide information about data.
eth-zurich.md,"3 Programming Code signifies machine-readable instructions created in the context of a research project, for example, to analyse Research Data, to reproduce research findings from a given data set or to perform experiments."
eth-zurich.md,"4 FAIR Principles are internationally recognised guidelines to improve the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse of digital assets. The principles emphasise machine-actionability (for details see Annex A).15"
eth-zurich.md,"5 Open Research Data (ORD) are Research Data that are FAIR and, in addition, publicly available, accessible and reusable at no cost. These guidelines understand ORD as an ideal to be strived for that might not be achievable in all cases (for justified exceptions see Art. 6.3)."
eth-zurich.md,"6 Research Data Management (hereinafter “RDM”) is the systematic, transparent, and adequate handling of data across the complete data lifecycle using recognised services and infrastructures. Research Data Management planning includes measures to be undertaken at every step of the data lifecycle16 to ensure transparency and reproducibility of research. Data management planning starts from the creation and/or collection of data, followed by their analysis, publication, storage, sharing, preservation and reuse. Together, all these steps are continuously documented in a Data Management Plan (hereinafter “DMP”). In addition, RDM can support fulfilling the FAIR Principles by distinguishing data of temporary or permanent relevance according to accepted Community Standards and thus providing a reliable basis for informed decisions on data deletion, temporary retention (usually a minimum of 10 years), or unlimited preservation."
eth-zurich.md,"7 Community Standards are understood as both explicit, formalised standards and informal, but well established and widely accepted best practices within a community. A community can, e.g. comprise researchers sharing an interest in the same object of research or working with the same methods. Common Community Standards address, e.g. identification, citation and reporting of Research Data and Metadata. They reflect a community’s consensus, at a certain point in time, on how reproducible and reusable research should be implemented."
eth-zurich.md,"8 Data Availability Statements provide a statement about where data necessary for validating the research findings reported in a result publication can be found — including, where applicable, hyperlinks to publicly archived additional datasets analysed or generated during the research activity."
eth-zurich.md,"9 Research Group Leaders are professors or heads of platforms and scientific facilities who hold budget and the overall responsibility for a research group, platform, or facility."
eth-zurich.md,### Chapter 2: Research Data Management
eth-zurich.md,Art. 4   Planning of Research Data Management
eth-zurich.md,1 ETH Zurich expects its researchers to include RDM in the planning of their activities.
eth-zurich.md,2 The establishment of best practices for working with Research Data in line with Community Standards is required and should be agreed upon on the appropriate organisational level (see article 10 below)
eth-zurich.md,"3 For research projects with temporal boundaries, a DMP (according to Art. 3, Para. 6 above) is expected not later than 6 months after the start of the research project. The DMP is an instrument for researchers themselves, to facilitate the implementation of good RDM practice in their projects as well as for planning storage and safeguarding of data according to Art. 7 below."
eth-zurich.md,4 DMP stipulations issued by funding agencies must be strictly adhered to. The responsibility for this lies with the grantee(s).
eth-zurich.md,#### Art. 5   Data collection and processing
eth-zurich.md,"1 Digital data that are in the process of being collected or processed must be stored such that data can be restored in case of hardware problems or human error. Using storage systems centrally supplied by ETH fulfils this criterion. If such data are too big for being stored redundantly in the available infrastructure, researchers must be able to recreate them using existing code and documentation when required."
eth-zurich.md,"2 Access rights to the storage system must be specified and regularly updated, e.g. upon the start of a new project. The scientific needs of all researchers working with the data must be considered by the access right system. Unauthorised access must be prevented by suitable technical and organisational measures, such as ETH Zurich’s identity and access management system."
eth-zurich.md,"3 In order to ensure long-term accessibility and reusability, the use of well-documented, nonproprietary file formats is recommended."
eth-zurich.md,"4 The structure and the processing steps of all Research Data must be digitally documented in order to ensure adherence to the FAIR principles. Where documentation includes a lab journal, Electronic Laboratory Notebooks (ELN) are recommended."
eth-zurich.md,#### Art. 6   Publication of Research Data and Programming Code
eth-zurich.md,1 Publication
eth-zurich.md,"a. Research Data and Programming Code that are considered as directly relevant for a result publication based on Community Standards must be published and deposited in a FAIR repository along with rich, openly available Metadata."
eth-zurich.md,"(i) If there are limitations for sharing relevant raw data online because sharing is technically or economically not feasible, FAIR allows for publishing Metadata only which contain information on how raw data can be accessed if necessary."
eth-zurich.md,"(ii) In the case of long-range data collection projects, the Research Data and Programming Code that are relevant for a result publication may be defined as a subset and may be aggregated."
eth-zurich.md,b. Research Data and Programming Code17 are by default published at the same time as the associated results. c. All publications of research results must contain a Data Availability Statement.
eth-zurich.md,#### 2 Repositories
eth-zurich.md,"a. The ETH Research Collection is available as institutional repository for Research Data publication. If a recognised ETH-external FAIR repository18 is used for depositing Research Data or Programming Code, it is recommended to register a metadata-only item in the ETH Research Collection linking to the dataset."
eth-zurich.md,"b. Commercial platforms which are well-suited for specific purposes (e.g. code development) are usually not considered as FAIR repositories. In case such platforms are used, a copy of the version of Programming Code belonging to a result publication must be archived in a FAIR repository.19"
eth-zurich.md,c. Commercial repositories should be avoided whenever possible.
eth-zurich.md,3 Restrictions
eth-zurich.md,"Restrictions on sharing and publishing Research Data and Programming Code may be justified and, in some cases, necessitated by the following reasons:"
eth-zurich.md,a. constraints due to institutional provisions and/or applicable superordinate national and/or international ethical principles and/or legal regulations;
eth-zurich.md,b. ongoing preparation of a patent application;
eth-zurich.md,c. contractual obligations (e.g. to industry partners);
eth-zurich.md,d. intended commercial use of a software linked to a data set;
eth-zurich.md,"e. intended use of Research Data and Programming Code for commercial purposes, e.g. sale."
eth-zurich.md,4 Licences
eth-zurich.md,a. Researchers must not hand over exclusive rights to the publication and further use of Research Data and/or Programming Code to repositories.
eth-zurich.md,"b. ETH Zurich advocates the precise specification of usage rights for Research Data in the form of a Creative Commons Licence or a Public Domain Dedication (CC0). For Programming Code, established Open Source licenses20 must be used."
eth-zurich.md,5 ETH Zurich supports the publication of Research Data and Programming Code as independent and citable academic achievements.
eth-zurich.md,#### Art. 7   Storage and Safeguarding
eth-zurich.md,"1 Research Data deposited in a repository according to the FAIR principles (see Art. 6) must be retained for extended periods of time, as a rule for a minimum of 10 years, unless legal or funder regulations or Community Standards require other periods. Researchers must make sure that the chosen repository observes the minimum and, where applicable, maximum storage periods."
eth-zurich.md,"2 For data which are not explicitly mentioned in Art. 5 and 6 and which are not deposited in a repository, a minimum storage period of 10 years applies where technically and economically feasible. Such data must be safeguarded at ETH Zurich if they are required for justifying the origin of published data in cases where those data might be challenged (see Art. 11 of the Integrity Guidelines).21"
eth-zurich.md,"3 For practical and cost reasons, such data can be moved, e.g. to inexpensive storage with ETH Zurich’s IT Services together with information on responsible contact persons and required retention periods. If for such data redundant storage in the available infrastructure is technically or economically not feasible, researchers must be able to fully recreate them using existing code and documentation if required."
eth-zurich.md,### Chapter 3: Responsibilities
eth-zurich.md,#### Art. 8   Responsibilities of researchers
eth-zurich.md,1 The departments:
eth-zurich.md,"a. inform new researchers about the RDM Guidelines that are in force at ETH and, if applicable, at the level of the department; and"
eth-zurich.md,b. define processes for the case where a Research Group Leader leaves ETH or retires in order to prevent the loss of valuable data and to make sure that archiving periods are observed.
eth-zurich.md,"2 Research Group Leaders are responsible for good RDM practice in their research groups, platform, or facility. This implies in particular:"
eth-zurich.md,"a. ensuring compliance with Community Standards, the present ETH’s RDM Guidelines and, if applicable, departmental as well as RDM guidelines established by other organizational units to which the group, platform or facility relates (e.g. institute, laboratory, non-departmental research unit);"
eth-zurich.md,b. ensuring access to suitable infrastructures (whether provided ETH-internal or – external); and
eth-zurich.md,c. taking decisions about access rights for unpublished data as well as for group members leaving ETH Zurich.22
eth-zurich.md,3 Research Group Leaders are free to define further roles and responsibilities regarding RDM.
eth-zurich.md,#### Art. 9   Responsible administrative units
eth-zurich.md,"1 ETH Zurich provides the basic infrastructure, information and services that facilitate and where possible enable RDM according to the present guidelines."
eth-zurich.md,"2 ETH’s central IT Services as well as IT support groups in the departments and all organisational units (e.g. institute, laboratory, non-departmental research unit) support researchers with processing and management of Research Data and Programming Code (see Annex B for details)."
eth-zurich.md,3 The ETH Library supports researchers in the planning of RDM as well as in the publication and long-term archiving of data (see Annex B for details).
eth-zurich.md,4 ETH Zurich may require financial expenditure to be covered by research groups for usage of infrastructure and services and for individual technical solutions provided.
eth-zurich.md,"5 The Office of Research is the main contact point for questions of policy development and supports the departments, organisational units (e.g. institutes, laboratories, non-departmental research units) and research groups, platforms, facilities wishing to compile and edit their own guidelines."
eth-zurich.md,6 The ETH Ethics Commission is the main point of contact for ethical questions about the publication of Research Data. The Legal Office may be involved for specific legal questions.
eth-zurich.md,### Chapter 4: Final provisions
eth-zurich.md,#### Art. 10   Further regulations
eth-zurich.md,"Departments, other organisational units (e.g. institute, laboratory, non-departmental research unit) or research groups, platforms and facilities as well as thematic clusters and competence centres consisting of different Departments and/or organisational units can issue further regulations that complement the present guidelines. These regulations may be more specific than but not in contradiction to the RDM Guidelines. Further regulations respect relevant Community Standards. They reflect the perspectives and needs of all academic career levels."
eth-zurich.md,#### Art. 11   Commencement
eth-zurich.md,The present guidelines enter into force on 1 July 2022.

fachhochschule-münster.md,# Research Data Management Policy of the University of Münster
fachhochschule-münster.md,## Preamble
fachhochschule-münster.md,"Research data represents a central element of both academic activity and the ensuing acquisition of knowledge, and thereby serves as an essential tool for acquiring knowledge. In the following, ‘research data’ is defined as all data collected, mined, simulated or derived in connection with a research process. The University of Münster (WWU) regards research data, therefore, as an academic product, to which it attaches great importance. In order to acquire, disseminate and substantiate scientific findings, it is therefore absolutely vital that University staff manage research data in a responsible and academically appropriate manner.1 Handling such data requires early implementation of a research data management policy. This comprises all phases of planning and execution, i.e. generation and collection, as well as the processing, application and storage of research data. It also includes the documentation of the context and tools used for collecting this data, as well as provisions detailing its subsequent use, reproducibility and quality assurance."
fachhochschule-münster.md,## Principles
fachhochschule-münster.md,"Based on “The German Research Foundation’s (DFG) Recommendations on Safeguarding Good Scientific Practice”2, the “Rules of Good Scientific Practice of the University of Münster”3 and the “DFG Guidelines on the Handling of Research Data”4, the University of Münster provides the following principles to serve as a guideline for its researchers. The University faculties are to tailor these principles to correspond to their subject-specific requirements."
fachhochschule-münster.md,"1. Researchers at the University of Münster are called upon to manage and document their research data responsibly and in accordance with academically recognised standards and practices throughout. Matters of ethics, data protection, copyright, confidentiality and secrecy are to be considered at all times."
fachhochschule-münster.md,"2. At the start of a research project, the project director is responsible for clearly stating how the research data is to be handled and ensuring compliance with subject-specific standards."
fachhochschule-münster.md,"3. Data management plans are regarded as an essential component of any research project, and therefore have to be drawn up at the start of a project. This plan should be amended with respect to changing circumstances as the project is carried out."
fachhochschule-münster.md,"4. Before a research project commences, the project director is called upon to explicitly determine and document all rights connected with research data resulting from the project, e.g. intellectual property rights, copyrights and usage rights. Particular attention should be paid to ensuring that the data remain freely accessible for academic purposes."
fachhochschule-münster.md,"5. Research data which serves as the basis of published findings must be archived for long-term usage in a data repository of the University of Münster or a suitable, trustworthy external data repository. If this is impracticable for reasons of confidentiality or secrecy, then equivalent archival solutions have to be implemented. The researchers are personally responsible for determining when and under what legal and usage-related conditions their research data is to be made publicly available."
fachhochschule-münster.md,6. Research data which form the essential basis of acquired knowledge should be documented in a research data registry of the University of Münster.
fachhochschule-münster.md,The University of Münster pledges to create the conditions necessary for complying with the principles listed above.5
fachhochschule-münster.md,Supplementary instructions for concretely applying and implementing these principles in research practice will be made available and updated on a continuous basis.
fachhochschule-münster.md,Adopted (in the original German version) by the Rectorate on 11 May 2017.
fachhochschule-münster.md,"The Rector, Prof Dr Johannes P. Wessels"

faculty-of-applied-sciences-at-technical-university-delft.md,# Faculty of Applied Sciences Research Data Management Policy
faculty-of-applied-sciences-at-technical-university-delft.md,## Preface
faculty-of-applied-sciences-at-technical-university-delft.md,"The Faculty of Applied Sciences Research Data Management Policy is part of the central TU Delft Research Data Framework Policy (which outlines the roles of the Library, ICT Department, University Services and the Executive Board at TU Delft, and from which italic sentences in this policy are derived).1 This policy helps create effective practices for working with research data at the faculty, and defines data management roles and responsibilities of the different stakeholders within the Faculty from the 1st of January 2020 onwards."
faculty-of-applied-sciences-at-technical-university-delft.md,"The principles outlined in this policy are elaborated in more detail, with supporting information available in the online guidance.2"
faculty-of-applied-sciences-at-technical-university-delft.md,"This policy is motivated by the belief that good data management leads to research that is more time- and cost-efficient as it prevents data loss and duplication of efforts and can contribute to the quality, reproducibility and impact of research. This policy is inspired by the FAIR principles: research data should be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) by archiving the data with proper documentation."

faculty-of-arts-at-the-university-of-groningen.md,within the Faculty of Arts (FoA)
faculty-of-arts-at-the-university-of-groningen.md,Update October 2022
faculty-of-arts-at-the-university-of-groningen.md,## 1. Introduction and context
faculty-of-arts-at-the-university-of-groningen.md,"Investing in the practice of transparent and reproducible science is a high priority of all academic institutions worldwide, organisations like NWO, KNAW and international research funders in general. Research data management, personal data protection and open science are pillars of this movement."
faculty-of-arts-at-the-university-of-groningen.md,This research data management (RDM) policy provides context and guidance to all members of the Faculty of Arts (FoA) that deal with research data in its broadest definition. The document will be regularly subjected to a review as it is affected by changes in the various regulations that underpin it.
faculty-of-arts-at-the-university-of-groningen.md,"The update of this document is based on the UG Research Data Policy dated June 2021, and needs to be read alongside the following documents:"
faculty-of-arts-at-the-university-of-groningen.md,the European General Data Protection Regulation (2016)
faculty-of-arts-at-the-university-of-groningen.md,Ethics and data protection (2018)

faculty-of-arts-at-the-university-of-groningen.md,(NETHICS)
faculty-of-arts-at-the-university-of-groningen.md,## 2. Organisation and responsibilities
faculty-of-arts-at-the-university-of-groningen.md,"There is joint responsibility for research data management within the UG. The guiding principle here is the Higher Education and Research Act and the elaboration thereof in the Administration and Management Regulations of the UG, which allocates the responsibility at different levels."
faculty-of-arts-at-the-university-of-groningen.md,"Responsible data management requires collaboration between management (organisational units within the university), scientific staff and support staff."
faculty-of-arts-at-the-university-of-groningen.md,### Faculty Board
faculty-of-arts-at-the-university-of-groningen.md,"The faculty board has a duty of care for its researchers and (PhD) students. They are responsible for setting up, maintaining and overseeing the implementation of a responsible data management policy in accordance with the UG Research Data Policy."
faculty-of-arts-at-the-university-of-groningen.md,The Board of the FoA has approved this update of the RDM policy document in October 2022. Changes to the RDM policy will also be subject to the approval by the Faculty Board.
faculty-of-arts-at-the-university-of-groningen.md,### CETO
faculty-of-arts-at-the-university-of-groningen.md,"The Faculty of Arts (FoA) committee for ethical review of research projects called CETO (Commissie Ethische Toetsing Onderzoek in Dutch) evaluates research projects within the Faculty (and sometimes from UG researchers outside the Faculty) involving human subjects and other ethical aspects. CETO is accountable to the Dean, who acts as Placeholder of Research."
faculty-of-arts-at-the-university-of-groningen.md,"Since July 2020, obtaining ethical approval is obligatory for researchers and PhD students within the FoA who run projects that involve (data of) human subjects."
faculty-of-arts-at-the-university-of-groningen.md,### Graduate Schools
faculty-of-arts-at-the-university-of-groningen.md,"The Graduate Schools are responsible for the proper onboarding, training and guidance of PhD students. In this role they can also point out the responsibility of PhD students regarding data management and the attention they should pay to research data management planning (RDMP) in their training and supervision plans (TSP). For training on research data management and data protection principles the Graduate Schools collaborate with the Digital Competence Centre (DCC). The Graduate Schools also play a role in preparing PhD supervisors to make arrangements, together with the PhD student, for the PhD student’s research data to be made reusable."
faculty-of-arts-at-the-university-of-groningen.md,### Support
faculty-of-arts-at-the-university-of-groningen.md,"The FoA’s Research Policy Officer coordinates the formulation and implementation of the research data management policy. The Policy Officer works closely together with the Data Steward/CETO secretary, and the FoA’s Privacy & Security Coordinator on matters concerning the GDPR. The data steward/secretary CETO monitors all incoming registrations of research projects and contacts researchers when research is deemed eligible for ethical assessment and/or in case of possible (privacy) risks. Together with the Privacy & Security coordinator, the data steward/secretary CETO performs a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) if deemed necessary. Additionally, the DCC offers university-wide support on research data management and protection and related IT solutions for both researchers and support staff."
faculty-of-arts-at-the-university-of-groningen.md,### Researchers
faculty-of-arts-at-the-university-of-groningen.md,"Three research institutes accommodate the research of the Faculty of Arts, namely the Centre for Language and Cognition (CLCG), the Groningen Research Institute for the Study of Culture (ICOG) and the Groningen Institute of Archaeology (GIA). Each institute consists of smaller centres or research groups. It follows that the FoA houses a mixed company of researchers, working with many different categories of research data or in fields that are not strictly data-driven."
faculty-of-arts-at-the-university-of-groningen.md,"And yet, this RDM policy applies to all researchers and PhD students of the FoA, ensuring that the faculty is exercising its oversight responsibility."
faculty-of-arts-at-the-university-of-groningen.md,## 3. Principles of Data Management
faculty-of-arts-at-the-university-of-groningen.md,### Scientific Integrity
faculty-of-arts-at-the-university-of-groningen.md,There are several key overarching principles that govern research at the University of Groningen and scientific research in general:
faculty-of-arts-at-the-university-of-groningen.md,"1. All research is to be undertaken according to relevant legislation, the requirements of ethically responsible research, such as informed consent, academic integrity, the arrangements set out in cooperation agreements, and the research conditions of funders."
faculty-of-arts-at-the-university-of-groningen.md,"2. When personal data are processed in research (within or from the EU), these must be handled in a way that meets the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). In particular, this entails the requirement to demonstrate that appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect the identity of research participants are in place."
faculty-of-arts-at-the-university-of-groningen.md,"3. Where feasible and ethically appropriate, researchers will make their data FAIR (see below)."
faculty-of-arts-at-the-university-of-groningen.md,"4. Research methodologies, experimental design, data, data analysis, statistics, results and interpretations should be subject to peer review and scrutiny, and all researchers should be able to substantiate their choices, and be able to provide access to all research results (papers, data and code) for validation."
faculty-of-arts-at-the-university-of-groningen.md,### FAIR research data
faculty-of-arts-at-the-university-of-groningen.md,The UG RDM policy is based on the FAIR data principles included in The Netherlands Code of Conduct for Research Integrity. These four principles are:
faculty-of-arts-at-the-university-of-groningen.md,#### Findable
faculty-of-arts-at-the-university-of-groningen.md,"Data is sustainably stored and curated Data is provided with metadata, including affiliation and, if possible, with a persistent identifier Data is registered on the basis of metadata in the research database of the university ccessible"
faculty-of-arts-at-the-university-of-groningen.md,"Data is accurate, complete, reliable, authentic and provided with metadata and, if possible, with a persistent identifier"

faculty-of-arts-at-the-university-of-groningen.md,"Open Science is one of the focal points of the Strategy Evaluation Protocol (SEP). The four pillars of open science are open data, open code (research software), open papers (open access) and open reviews (open evaluation). The FoA stimulates making research data, lab notes and other research processes freely available where possible, under terms that enable reuse, redistribution and reproduction of the research and its underlying data and methods. Doing so will not only result in a more transparent, verifiable and faster research process, but will also enable companies and societal organisations to readily gain access to, and use scientific information in an early phase."
faculty-of-arts-at-the-university-of-groningen.md,## 4. Research data management workflow agreements
faculty-of-arts-at-the-university-of-groningen.md,This Research Data Management Policy formulates a set of agreements that apply to all research conducted within the FoA and that refer to different stages of the research process. The FoA Research Data Management Protocol provides a practical guide listing best practices and preferred solutions.
faculty-of-arts-at-the-university-of-groningen.md,### Research data before research
faculty-of-arts-at-the-university-of-groningen.md,Registration
faculty-of-arts-at-the-university-of-groningen.md,"Each researcher (or group of researchers) has to draw up a Research Data Management Plan (RDMP) for each research project during the phase of research design (for example as part of an application for research funding). This requirement applies to all research projects in which research data are being collected or reused. All PhD students are obliged to draw up and hand in an RDMP at the start of their research project, as part of their Training and Supervision Plan (TSP)."
faculty-of-arts-at-the-university-of-groningen.md,The FoA offers facilities for digitally submitting an RDMP according to the FoA template (see the FoA RDM protocol).
faculty-of-arts-at-the-university-of-groningen.md,### GDPR & ethical assessment
faculty-of-arts-at-the-university-of-groningen.md,"Researchers and PhD students have to act in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation when dealing with personal data, and in accordance with other statutory and ethical rules (where they apply). In addition, obtaining ethical approval from CETO is obligatory for researchers and PhD students within the FoA who plan for research projects that involve human subjects or human subject data."
faculty-of-arts-at-the-university-of-groningen.md,### Research data during research (storage)
faculty-of-arts-at-the-university-of-groningen.md,"In the life cycle of research data it is important to distinguish between the phase in which data is still being manipulated and analysed (mutable data) and the phase in which research data has been processed and become static (immutable data). The same distinction exists for storage (during research) and archiving systems (after research), which have different functional and technical requirements."
faculty-of-arts-at-the-university-of-groningen.md,#### On-premises storage
faculty-of-arts-at-the-university-of-groningen.md,"On-premises storage refers to storage that is hosted by the UG itself in its own data centres, managed by the Centre for Information Technology (CIT), and that is regularly backed-up. Examples are the X- or Y-drive attached to the university workplace (UWP). Storing your research data on-premises is always preferred over using personal (external) storage devices or cloud storage, for reasons of data security and protection (prevention of data loss and data leak)."
faculty-of-arts-at-the-university-of-groningen.md,#### Cloud storage
faculty-of-arts-at-the-university-of-groningen.md,"Many third-party (non-UG-hosted) systems or applications are available to researchers to help collect, share, analyse and/or visualise research data (e.g. Qualtrics, ArcGIS Online, Google Drive). If third party tools process, hold or retain research data in any form in the course of a research project researchers should specify their use of these systems in their RDMP. The FoA strongly recommends researchers to move their research data to onpremises storage as soon as possible after the collection and/or processing of data is complete and after collaborations on shared (cloud) storage have been concluded."
faculty-of-arts-at-the-university-of-groningen.md,### Research data after research (archiving)
faculty-of-arts-at-the-university-of-groningen.md,Archiving and retention
faculty-of-arts-at-the-university-of-groningen.md,"Data gathered for scientific, historical or statistical purposes should be stored for a period of at least ten years after it has been processed (to enable scrutiny in relation to concerns about matters of scientific integrity)."
faculty-of-arts-at-the-university-of-groningen.md,"Data can be kept longer than ten years for historical, statistical or research purposes (for example in the case of archeological or historical data)."
faculty-of-arts-at-the-university-of-groningen.md,Data must be archived such that:
faculty-of-arts-at-the-university-of-groningen.md,"an academic staff member from the same discipline can understand and verify that data, and possibly replicate the research (data should be accompanied by relevant documentation and metadata); it is accessible in the long term, i.e. stored in a future-proof format."
faculty-of-arts-at-the-university-of-groningen.md,"Non-digital data must be duplicated in digital or non-digital form, so that both the researcher and the Faculty can keep a copy. If it is not possible to make a duplicate, then the data must be stored at the Faculty whereby the researcher will have unrestricted access, including after they leave the employment of the University."
faculty-of-arts-at-the-university-of-groningen.md,### Personal data storage limitation
faculty-of-arts-at-the-university-of-groningen.md,"In case of personal data, the GDPR specifies a storage limitation principle: “Personal data shall be kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed.” The GDPR does not set specific time limits for different types of data, but requires that controllers and processors set limits based on the purposes of the processing or that de-identification measures are taken. Researchers should therefore specify when they plan to remove the personal data they have collected, or what (de-identification) measures they have taken to be able to retain their data, in their RDMP."
faculty-of-arts-at-the-university-of-groningen.md,### Research data publication
faculty-of-arts-at-the-university-of-groningen.md,"Research data publication ranges from making data findable (registering the availability of a dataset externally) to making data completely and openly available for reuse. Any dataset can be registered in the UG Research Portal (using PURE) so that it is findable externally. Additionally, researchers can upload archived research data to an external repository. A data repository is a place that holds data, makes data available to use, and organises data in a logical manner. A data repository may also be defined as an appropriate, subject-specific location where researchers can submit their data. The FoA strongly encourages researchers to deposit their data and software in an appropriate data repository to enhance their findability, accessibility and impact. Following the FAIR adagium “as open as possible, as closed as necessary” the researcher"
faculty-of-arts-at-the-university-of-groningen.md,"applies appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect the data, such as anonymization or pseudonymization (in case of personal data)."
faculty-of-arts-at-the-university-of-groningen.md,### Research software publication
faculty-of-arts-at-the-university-of-groningen.md,"Research software is defined as any piece of code or script that enables researchers to process, manipulate, generate and analyse data or automatize or test these procedures. The availability of software developed for the purpose of producing research results, together with the respective research data, is essential for the reproducibility and transparency of research. The FoA strongly advises researchers who work with research software to seek the help of the DCC for drafting a Research Software Management Plan in the research design phase, in preparation of software publication after research."
faculty-of-arts-at-the-university-of-groningen.md,### End of UG affiliation or employment
faculty-of-arts-at-the-university-of-groningen.md,Researchers who leave the FoA are obliged to deposit and describe the research data they have collected during their work at the University of Groningen. The line manager (chair holder) monitors the correct and complete deposit of the research data. PhD students are obliged to properly deposit and describe their research data at the end of their research project (or when leaving the FoA prematurely). The GSH coordinator (in consultation with the supervisor) checks whether all relevant data has been deposited. The PhD defence ceremony will not be scheduled if this requirement has not been met.

faculty-of-genetic-diversity-centre-of-eth-zurich.md,"All data managed on the GDC servers must be directly associated to at least one project listed in the GDC project database. Research data not produced at the GDC can be transferred, stored and analyzed on the GDC server if it is related to an active project. Please note that data transfer over 1TB requires the prior approval from the GDC, and a data integrity test after the transfer is strongly suggested."
faculty-of-genetic-diversity-centre-of-eth-zurich.md,"Once the project is completed, the data must be transferred off the server within 12 months. The GDC offers archiving solutions. Information about the project status can be obtained at any time."

faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,# Faculty of Humanities Research Data Management Policy July 2020
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,## About this document
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,This document sets out the policy on the management of research data (hereinafter data) at the Faculty of Humanities of Utrecht University. This policy outlines the criteria and guidelines for adequate data management and specifies the various roles and responsibilities of the parties concerned at the faculty.
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,The document is divided into three parts:
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,"I. A description of the aim and scope of the data management policy as well as the policy frameworks within which the policy applies. II. A description of the definitions, principles, responsibilities and guidelines for the policy. III. A description of the current support for data management at the faculty and the university."
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,"## I - Aim, scope and frameworks"
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,### Aim of this policy
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,The aim of this policy is to ensure careful data management within the faculty during and after the completion of research projects. The faculty regulates data management according to the FAIR principles:
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,"Findable: data and metadata are findable, preferably in a digital system."
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,"Accessible: data and metadata are stored and maintained in such a manner that they can be accessed and downloaded easily. In addition, there are clear provisions on accessibility and use."
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,Interoperable: data and metadata are available in common formats and conform to regular standards so that the exchange and the combining of such data with other data or metadata is optimally facilitated.
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,Reusable: data are described in a manner that facilitates research reproduction and/or the combining of the data with other data.1
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,"The policy focuses on digital data. The faculty aims to store research data in a digital format, as much as is possible. Particular focus is placed on data containing personal data or data to which intellectual property provisions apply."
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,### Scope of this policy
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,"The policy applies to everyone who is affiliated with the Faculty of Humanities at Utrecht University and conducts research, including internal and external PhD candidates, but explicitly excluding students."
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,"### Rules, policy frameworks and conditions"
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,"This policy represents the further implementation of a number of laws, regulations and policy frameworks, primarily the Utrecht University Policy Framework for Research Data and the Netherlands Code of Conduct for Research Integrity, in which the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has been taken into account. Furthermore, the policy is in line with the wishes and requirements of research grant providers in the area of data management, in particular the"
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,"Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) and the European Research Council (ERC), and the principles of Open Science."
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,"## II - Definitions, responsibilities, principles and guidelines"
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,### Definitions
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,#### Research project
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,"In this document a research project means: all the activities conducted by researchers aimed at arriving at a scientific analysis or opinions, irrespective of whether they are reflected in or are geared towards publications (or other forms of output)."
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,#### Research data
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,Research data are all the data or procedures (such as algorithms) used for a research project that form the basis for the results or lead to results.
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,"Research data may take many forms including but not limited to: observations, documents, literature references, archaeological material, books, transcribed interviews, source codes, software scripts, parameter settings, theoretical models, simulations and measurements. All the material needed to reproduce research results is regarded as research data and requires adequate data management."
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,"It is common practice to differentiate between unprocessed (primary/raw/rough) data, the procedures that cleanse, anonymise and prepare the data, and the final secondary ‘cleansed’ data."
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,#### Personal data
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,"The GDPR defines personal data as: any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person who is still alive. This means information that either relates directly to a person or can be traced back to that person.2 Personal data can also be provided to third parties, for example, during interviews or in open questions for surveys."
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,"Research projects in which interviews or surveys are used often involve personal data, i.e. the contact details of the research population. Even though personal data usually are irrelevant for the research, they do form part of the total research data and partially safeguard the integrity of the research."
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,#### Data package
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,"A coherent set of data and procedures that has been stored unchanged for a longer period of time (archived). A data package contains a description, also referred to as metadata, which clearly shows the content of the package. Based on the data package and the accompanying metadata, it must be possible to validate the claims that are based on the data concerned."
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,"A data package can consist of different data, such as multiple tables, scripts for statistical processing, stimulus material, audio files containing interviews and the interview transcripts in text files."
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,Archiving (of data packages)
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,"This refers to the storage of data in an unchanged form for a longer period of time. In many cases data are packaged together with a code book, a lab journal (or archive journal) and a description of the data, the metadata. The set of data and the accompanying description are referred to as a data package. Data packages are archived at the time at which a scientific publication is based on the data package or at the end of a research project."
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,Publication (of digital data)
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,"If the data are archived as a data package, the package can subsequently be published. This means that the data package will be findable. In practice, the publication of a data package means that the metadata are published (in a data catalogue, for example)."
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,"Although publication makes a data package findable, this does not mean that the data are automatically accessible: a data package can be published as a ‘Closed Access Package’ (see also p. 6). A persistent identifier, a reference that enables the clear referencing and easy localisation of digital data, is assigned upon publication of the data package."
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,### Responsibilities
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,"A general principle is that every staff member is expected to manage relevant data as a good steward. In addition, Utrecht University specifically distinguishes between the following actors, each bearing their own responsibilities for data management."
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,"1. The data creators: researchers and PhD candidates and support staff, who have primary responsibility for looking after the research data. In the case of students, the responsibility lies with their supervisor(s). Supervisor(s) ensure that students are aware of the guidelines on responsible data management. In the case of support staff, the responsibility lies with the researcher ultimately responsible for the particular project."
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,"2. Directors of education and research directors are responsible for ensuring that the researchers, research leaders, students and their supervisors in the department abide by the university policy framework and any supplementary faculty regulations. They may also establish further guidelines as needed."
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,3. Deans draw up further faculty guidelines pursuant to the university policy framework and are responsible for ensuring that the directors of education and research directors implement both the university policy framework and the faculty guidelines.
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,"4. The Executive Board draws up, ensures monitoring and facilitates the implementation of the general university framework, for example, through the provision of infrastructure, information and other forms of support."
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,### Principles
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,Data storage and archiving
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,The management of research data often relates to forms of storage. A distinction is made between the storage of data used in ongoing research projects and archival storage (see p. 6).
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,"The storage of data used in ongoing research projects relates to data and scripts that have been created, adjusted and possibly deleted again during the course of the research project. In archival storage the data are stored unchanged for a predetermined period of time."
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,"The principle underlying the faculty policy is that archival storage must be used as soon as the data concerned are used to substantiate a scientific claim, for instance, for a scientific publication."
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,### Rights
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,"Utrecht University has the authority to make decisions on data packages stored under the management of Utrecht University on its own infrastructure to the extent that these decisions do not conflict with earlier agreements made with the researcher(s) or between the researcher(s) and other rightholders. Examples are: transferring the data package to another data archive (such as DANS Narcis) or the migration of file formats. Exclusive rights for the reuse or publication of research data will not be transferred to commercial publishers and their representatives without the owners themselves retaining the right to make available the research data for reuse through open access, unless this originally was a precondition for the provision of funds."
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,"Any researcher who is responsible for a research project must draw up a data management plan (DMP) in any event prior to publication, but preferably before the start of the research project. The DMP should at least describe what data will be collected as part of the project, where the data will be stored and who has access to the data during the research project. It also states where (a version of) the data is archived as a data package, how the data package can be found, who can access it and under what conditions."
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,"If personal data are used in a research project, the DMP should explicitly describe what additional measures have been taken to ensure the lawful and careful handling of personal data. This might include a description of the legal basis for collecting the data (e.g. informed consent), the anonymisation method, and processing upon completion of the project (e.g. the destruction of contact details). Furthermore, a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) must be carried out.3 Finally, the data collection must be registered by the faculty data manager. The responsible researcher initiates these activities and ensures completion in the correct manner."
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,"In the case of human subject research, a proposal should furthermore be submitted to the Faculty Ethical Review Committee (FETC) prior to conducting the research.4 Data may not be collected until a positive assessment has been received."
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,### Regulations
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,Storage of data packages
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,"Research data must be managed in accordance with the applicable university requirements relating to information security, privacy protection and transparency."
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,"During the research project, data must be stored in an environment with an access restrictions option and back-up facilities. The standard environment provided by the faculty for this purpose is YODA. Other options are the O: drive or SURFdrive. Researchers can consult the Research Data Management Support website to identify a suitable storage environment.5 Researchers may propose using a different environment and should first submit a proposal to the faculty data manager."
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,"If the data contain personal data, the use of YODA as a storage environment is obligatory. It is possible to derogate from this obligation but only with the permission of the Information Security Officer. Local storage is temporarily permitted, for example, because data have been recorded on a peripheral device. However, the data must be encrypted for local storage, and transferred to YODA as soon as possible and destroyed locally. Further guidelines for the storage of data containing personal data follow below."
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,Handling data containing personal data
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,"Legal requirements laid down in the GDPR apply to the processing of personal data. Researchers attached to the Faculty of Humanities must therefore process personal data in accordance with the requirements laid down in the GDPR, and in accordance with the requirements laid down by Utrecht University and the Faculty of Humanities. In general, this means that6:"
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,"o Before creating a data collection, the researcher must carry out data classification and a DPIA, supported by the faculty data manager or otherwise.7"
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,"o Limit: only the personal data required for the research are collected. If, prior to the research, the purpose for which personal data are used to answer a research question is not clear, those personal data should not be collected."
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,"o Separate: directly identifiable personal data must be separated from the other data and replaced by pseudo codes as soon as possible. Files in which the directly identifiable personal data and the corresponding pseudo codes are recorded, the ‘key files’, must be separated from the other research data."
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,"o Inform: as far as is possible, the persons concerned will be informed of the research and requested to grant permission for use of their data."
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,"o Provide control: as far as is possible and/or reasonable, research subjects will be given the opportunity to inspect their data, correct their data or withdraw from the research."
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,"o Render unidentifiable: data containing personal data are archived only after anonymisation so that the data cannot be directly traced back to individuals. Anonymisation can be carried out using aggregations, or pseudo codes to replace the personal data."
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,o Hide: data containing personal data must be stored in locations with encryption.
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,o The storage or transmission of such data outside the European Economic Area is not permitted.
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,"o Data containing personal data may only be exchanged with third parties provided that explicit agreements (transfer or processing agreements)8 have been concluded for that purpose. As soon as (a version of) the data form the basis for a scientific claim expressed in a scientific publication, for instance, the data concerned are packaged together in a data package, archived and published."
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,"The data package contains, to the extent possible, all the necessary data, descriptions, scripts and images in order to: o reproduce the research results;"
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,o retrieve the origin of the data;
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,o understand the collection method;
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,o identify the staff involved in creating the data package;
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,o understand the objective of the research;
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,o know the conditions for reusing the data;
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,o know the minimum storage duration.
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,"Depending on the archive, repository or storage environment selected, the researcher can include most of the above information in the standard metadata forms currently available. All the information the researcher is unable to include in the metadata forms should be recorded in a text file that is added to the data package."
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,"As stated earlier, YODA is the faculty's preferred digital archive and publication platform.9 Other data archives, repositories or storage environments may be used. Researchers should consult the Research Data Management Support website to identify a suitable archive environment. Researchers may propose using a different environment and should first submit a proposal to the faculty data manager."
faculty-of-humanities-of-utrecht-university.md,"In principle, data must be anonymised before being archived. Data that cannot be anonymised are archived and published as a data package referenced as ‘Closed Access’. Closed Access data packages can only be accessed by the data owners."

faculty-of-technology-policy-and-management-at-the-technical-university-delft.md,JANUARI 2020
faculty-of-technology-policy-and-management-at-the-technical-university-delft.md,## Preface
faculty-of-technology-policy-and-management-at-the-technical-university-delft.md,"The Faculty of Technology, Policy, and Management Research Data Management Policy is part of the central TU Delft Research Data Framework Policy. The Faculty of Technology, Policy, and Management Research Data Management Policy helps create effective practices for working with research data at the faculty, and defines data management roles and responsibilities of the different stakeholders within the faculty."
faculty-of-technology-policy-and-management-at-the-technical-university-delft.md,"Note that the Faculty of Technology, Policy, and Management Research Data Management Policy only specifies the Roles and Responsibilities of faculty-specific stakeholders. TU Delft Research Data Framework Policy should be consulted about the roles of the Library, ICT Department, University Services and the Executive Board at TU Delft."
faculty-of-technology-policy-and-management-at-the-technical-university-delft.md,"This Policy is motivated by the belief that good data stewardship leads to research that is more time- and cost-efficient and it is inspired by principles that research data should be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR)."
faculty-of-technology-policy-and-management-at-the-technical-university-delft.md,### This policy cultivates:
faculty-of-technology-policy-and-management-at-the-technical-university-delft.md,: Best practice for ensuring that scientific arguments and results are reproducible in
faculty-of-technology-policy-and-management-at-the-technical-university-delft.md,the long term.
faculty-of-technology-policy-and-management-at-the-technical-university-delft.md,: Better exposure of academic work of researchers at TU Delft leading to recognition of quality of the research process as a whole.
faculty-of-technology-policy-and-management-at-the-technical-university-delft.md,": Responsible management of research data, including the safe storage of research data and protection of intellectual capital developed by scientists across TU Delft."
faculty-of-technology-policy-and-management-at-the-technical-university-delft.md,: Improved practices for meeting the demands of funders and publishers with respect to research data management and sharing.
faculty-of-technology-policy-and-management-at-the-technical-university-delft.md,### This policy recognises that:
faculty-of-technology-policy-and-management-at-the-technical-university-delft.md,": Individual departments and research groups have different working practices and processes and will therefore require dedicated guidelines – this document focuses on the aspects of research data management applicable to all departments. : Data management is the entire process of managing research data from its creation to its re-use and preservation and it is not equal to Open Science. While it is beneficial to publish research data openly, there might be valid ethical, legal or commercial implications, which will make data unsuitable for open sharing. . ""Relevant research data"" might mean different things in different disciplines. Source code, experimental notes, protocols, models, and other forms of information supporting traditional publication are also within the scope of this policy."
faculty-of-technology-policy-and-management-at-the-technical-university-delft.md,"The policy is applicable to all researchers of the faculty (PhD students, postdocs, researchers and project leaders). However, the research activities of students, such as bachelor and master students’ projects, are out the scope of this policy. In such cases, we encourage students and supervisors to follow the principles of this policy, but this does not constitute a requirement."
faculty-of-technology-policy-and-management-at-the-technical-university-delft.md,### The key points of this TPM Research Data Management Policy are:
faculty-of-technology-policy-and-management-at-the-technical-university-delft.md,. This policy is a refinement of the TU Delft Research Data Management Framework policy
faculty-of-technology-policy-and-management-at-the-technical-university-delft.md,". This policy is applicable to all research activities performed by researchers (including PhD students), but do not apply to Bachelor and Master students’ activities. . This policy focuses on how data should be managed but does not specify which data should be managed. What constitutes “relevant research data” is domainand activity-specific, and is therefore left to researchers’ interpretation, based on the standards of their research community."
faculty-of-technology-policy-and-management-at-the-technical-university-delft.md,: All relevant research data and code needed to support and/or reproduce research findings are appropriately documented and archived at the end of a research project
faculty-of-technology-policy-and-management-at-the-technical-university-delft.md,". All archived research data and code should be made as F.A.l.R. as possible : All archived research data and code have a clear licensing scheme and the data should be “as open as possible, and as closed as necessary”"
faculty-of-technology-policy-and-management-at-the-technical-university-delft.md,: Research data retention period is fixed to a minimum of 10 years
faculty-of-technology-policy-and-management-at-the-technical-university-delft.md,: Data Stewards assist researchers in these activities
faculty-of-technology-policy-and-management-at-the-technical-university-delft.md,. This document will be revised regularly (every 2 years)
faculty-of-technology-policy-and-management-at-the-technical-university-delft.md,This policy enters in application on the 1st of January 2020.

free-university-berlin.md,## 1 Preamble
free-university-berlin.md,"Today, a responsible approach to digital research data is one of the cornerstones of transparent, high-quality, visible, and sustainable research. Freie Universität Berlin supports its members (researchers, instructors, and students) in implementing the relevant principles in alignment with the German Research Foundation’s Guidelines on the Handling of Research Data1 and Guidelines for Safeguarding Good Research Practice,2 Freie Universität Berlin’s Statute for Safeguarding Good Scientific Practice,3 Freie Universität Berlin’s Open Access Policy,4 the FAIR Data Principles 5 as well as other recommendations6 regarding the entire research process, from data collection to the publication of research findings. Above and beyond these basic principles, Freie Universität Berlin believes that in the long term, research data are useful not only in a scientific context, but also have the potential to be used and distributed throughout society in accordance with the principles of open research (open science, open scholarship). The university encourages a culture of dialogue as a basis for developing quality assurance concepts for research data in the various departments and subject areas."
free-university-berlin.md,## 2 Scope
free-university-berlin.md,"This policy applies to all members of Freie Universität Berlin 7 as well as to visiting researchers and guest lecturers, and partners and institutions with which the university holds a cooperation agreement. Where specific funding agreements with external funders stipulate other rules on data management, those rules take precedence. The binding policies of Freie Universität on data protection 8 and IT security 9 also apply."
free-university-berlin.md,## 3 Definition
free-university-berlin.md,"This policy applies to all research-related analog data, documents, and objects that are to be digitized in the course of a given research process as well as to “born digital” (i.e., originally created in a digital medium) data, documents, and objects produced in the course of a research process and/or that are the object or result of such a process. Research data are also defined as any data that facilitate the documentation, transparency, and – depending on the research area – replication of research outcomes (metadata).10"
free-university-berlin.md,"Common examples of such research data are digitizations, audiovisual data, digital representations of analog data, measurement data, observation data, survey data, texts and text editions, databases, object collections, protocols, methodological test procedures, questionnaires, software, and simulations.11 The German Research Foundation (DFG) also defines source code and software as research data where they represent central outcomes of scientific research.12 The broad spectrum of data types reflects the diversity of scientific disciplines and their different research methods and processes."
free-university-berlin.md,"In the course of the research process, research data can take on several forms. They may vary in quality depending on how they are prepared or if additional data are added. The form of the data may also depend on the stage of processing, or they may be provided in different formats for presentation purposes. Furthermore, they may be subject to varying access regulations (open data, restricted data, closed data)."
free-university-berlin.md,"The management of research data is an ongoing part of the entire research process. It includes the organization, documentation, storage, back-up, archiving, sharing, and publication of data. Research data management not only increases the visibility of the generated and/or processed data, but also the related research. It also helps to improve data quality and data processing, while making subsequent use of the data easier both for the original researchers and for others. Moreover, it facilitates the use of data in new contexts created when different data sets are linked. Sustainable research data management ensures the fulfillment of subject-specific requirements, as well as potential obligations related to funding agreements. It also helps meet publishers’ standards and requirements, as well as ensuring compliance with the principles of good scientific practice."
free-university-berlin.md,## 4 Handling Research Data
free-university-berlin.md,"Freie Universität Berlin encourages researchers to structure and archive their research data and to make these accessible in accordance with the FAIR principles. These principles aim to make digital data more findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. Research data should be managed in a way that is compatible with the relevant subject-specific practices, with the principles of ethical research, 13 and the guidelines and recommendations issued by professional associations in the relevant subject.14 Freie Universität Berlin adheres to the principles of the “Sorbonne Declaration on Research Data Rights,” 15 and recommends that researchers work on the guiding principle of “as open as possible, as closed as necessary.”"
free-university-berlin.md,### 4.1 Research and Project Planning; Administering and Managing Research Data
free-university-berlin.md,"It is recommended that project leaders include the costs of resources required to store and manage data (staff costs, project-specific hardware and software, charges for use) in grant applications. Even if funding institutions do not require it, Freie Universität Berlin recommends that researchers create a data management plan (DMP) as early as possible. The DMP should include details on how data will be collected, administered, secured, stored, used, and published. It should also include an agreement on data organization, the assignment of responsibilities, intellectual property,16 regulations regarding staff fluctuation, as well as specifications on data access. The data management plan should be reviewed regularly in the course of the research project and updated whenever necessary."
free-university-berlin.md,"Descriptive metadata should be linked to the research data on an ongoing basis as an integrated part of the research project rather than waiting until the project is completed. It is also essential that the methods and tools used to generate, enrich, structure, and analyze the data are documented in full. This ensures compliance with quality standards, helps to keep the process transparent, and also ensures that the research can be replicated in accordance with the respective subject-specific norms. The University Library can help with choosing suitable tools for this process."
free-university-berlin.md,"### 4.2	 Publishing, Licensing, Storing, and Archiving Research Data"
free-university-berlin.md,"Machine-readable, processable research data can be deposited, referenced, and made accessible in different repositories. Depending on the project, researchers might choose a domain-specific repository, a subject-specific repository, or Freie Universität’s own institutional repository, “Refubium.”17"
free-university-berlin.md,"Where intellectual property or data protection legislation or the principles of ethical research require restricting access to research data, Freie Universität offers technical archiving solutions. 18 If there are reasons why research-relevant data are not to be stored, this should be documented in accordance with the recommendations on good scientific practice. If the research data are archived but not published, Freie Universität recommends that the metadata are deposited in Refubium to ensure the maximum visibility and long-term citability of research outcomes."
free-university-berlin.md,The University Library assists members of the university in documenting and cataloguing their data for publication 19 and in using sustainable and/or open standard formats 20.
free-university-berlin.md,"If usage or publication rights are to be transferred, use of the data for academic purposes should be guaranteed on a perpetual basis. Freie Universität Berlin therefore recommends granting open licenses for use when data (including their metadata) are published, e.g., CC0 or CC BY 21 for data, GNU General Public License 22 or MIT License 23 for source code. Data should be assigned persistent identifiers, e.g., Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs)."
free-university-berlin.md,"The University Library offers this service free of charge. 24 For the citation and/or referencing of data 25 and software 26, researchers should refer to established standards."
free-university-berlin.md,"Research data must be stored and made accessible for as long as required and possible according to the recommendations and rules of research funders within the framework of statutory and legal provisions (e.g., the EU regulations on personal data [GDPR], intellectual property law). The minimum time for which research data should be stored is usually ten years from the date of publication of the data or the relevant work and/or the end of the project. 27 Freie Universität’s institutional storage systems (ZEDAT; Refubium) ensure that data are stored for at least this long."
free-university-berlin.md,"If research data are to be deleted from the institutional storage systems, then this must be done in agreement with the relevant researchers as well as the infrastructure providers (i.e., the University Library and ZEDAT) following the expiry of the required archiving period and in compliance with all legal and ethical requirements. The decision as to whether to retain or delete the data should take into account the interests and contractual obligations of external funders and/or other stakeholders, such as cooperation partners, participating research institutions, etc."
free-university-berlin.md,## 5 Legal and Ethical Considerations
free-university-berlin.md,"Research data management must always and at all times take into account the current statutory requirements, especially in relation to the protection of individuals and of intellectual property (copyright law, General Data Protection Regulation), as well as the requirements of this policy, subject to special arrangements with third parties (e.g., research groups, joint projects) and to ethical considerations."
free-university-berlin.md,"The ownership of usage rights is regulated in the employment contract between the researcher and Freie Universität and/or other specific agreements with the researcher. The rules stipulated in other agreements (funding agreements, cooperation agreements, research permissions) and the rights and standards applicable to the persons and groups, if any, who form the object of the research also apply. It may be necessary to carry out individual assessments of cases where ownership of the intellectual property in relation to the data is vested solely in the researcher(s) and/or specific research institutions."
free-university-berlin.md,## 6 Responsibilities
free-university-berlin.md,### 6.1 Research and Teaching
free-university-berlin.md,"Members of Freie Universität Berlin are bound by the principles of good research practice set out by the German Research Foundation (DFG). Freie Universität’s statute on safeguarding good scientific practice 28 stipulates that researchers must ensure that the research data created and processed in the context of their research project must be, wherever possible, organized, documented, made accessible, and stored in a long-term and sustainable way. The researchers at Freie Universität are responsible for implementing the various rules and guidelines that apply to their research, including rules and standards issued by their respective departments and in consideration of all ethical and statutory requirements.29  Proper handling of research data is also highly relevant in the context of teaching and education. Members of Freie Universität do their best to ensure students and researchers for whom they have a responsibility are aware of the various methods of research data management applicable to their respective subjects 30, whether this is in teaching and training (especially research-oriented teaching), research-based internships, projects, or final theses."
free-university-berlin.md,### 6.2 Institutional Obligations
free-university-berlin.md,"The University Library provides consultations on the organizational, legal, and ethical aspects of research data management, as well as on questions related to information science in this context. It offers support to researchers, especially in designing a research data management plan, and in selecting and implementing the best archiving and, where applicable, publishing strategy. Where researchers are dealing with more complex requirements, the Office of the General Counsel, the Central Ethics Committee, and ZEDAT also offer advice on finding tailored solutions for specific legal, ethical, and technical issues. The University Library also supports researchers through training in basic skills and norms in relation to research data management. It can advise the departments and other units in setting up and developing their own training programs, e.g., for Collaborative Research Centers (CRCs). ZEDAT offers one-on-one consultations for researchers along with workshops for small or large working groups on subjects such as computation for scientists, finding the right software, and identifying capacity needs, for example, for big data projects 31."
free-university-berlin.md,"The Open Access Policy of Freie Universität Berlin 32 encourages the idea that publishable research data should be accessible, and the university supports all researchers in making this possible as well as supporting recognition for data publications and developed software. The university strongly recommends that researchers consider and implement the relevant practices when handling research data in the context of assessing final theses and dissertations, in evaluations, and recruitment and appointment procedures. Freie Universität Berlin is also working toward the establishment of research data management as a core aspect of the curricula in all subject areas and in the courses offered by the central facilities as part of its endeavors to embed good scientific practice in all areas of the university."
free-university-berlin.md,## 7 Entry into Force
free-university-berlin.md,"This policy was approved by the Academic Senate of Freie Universität Berlin on May 5, 2021, and thereby entered into force."
free-university-berlin.md,"The University Library will be responsible for coordinating a review of this policy every two years with the participating central offices and committees to evaluate its validity in order to adapt it to new challenges, developments in infrastructure, and the needs of researchers."
free-university-berlin.md,Compliance with statutory and regulatory norms (including data protection legislation) is regularly monitored.
free-university-berlin.md,The University Library is the point of contact for any questions related to this policy (forschungsdaten@fu-berlin.de).

friedrich-schiller-universität-jena.md,Guidelines and recommendations on research data management at the Friedrich Schiller University Jena
friedrich-schiller-universität-jena.md,20 december 2016
friedrich-schiller-universität-jena.md,# Preface
friedrich-schiller-universität-jena.md,At the Friedrich Schiller University Jena (FSU) research data are regarded an essential resource for gaining scientific insights. The FSU strives to support its members with suitable research data management services. These services are provided by the central service facilities and will be continuously evaluated and enhanced.
friedrich-schiller-universität-jena.md,"The present guidelines and recommendations supplement and specify the principles formulated in the ""Policy on the handling of research data at the Friedrich Schiller University Jena"". The Research Data Management Helpdesk serves as a central point of contact for all matters relating to research data. The website of the helpdesk1 provides the most recent information."
friedrich-schiller-universität-jena.md,## I. Planning phase: before the research project
friedrich-schiller-universität-jena.md,"While planning a research activity in which data are collected or where data form the basis of your research, it is highly recommended to examine the requirements and possibilities for efficient and sustainable research data management from early on. The Research Data Management Helpdesk is there to assist you in determining your individual requirements, find out about services and funding opportunities, and to develop a suitable strategy for your project."
friedrich-schiller-universität-jena.md,"The Service center for research and transfer2 provides general advice on proposals for third-party funding. Coordinated programs of the DFG (e.g. SFBs, research groups) are supported by the office of the Vice-President for Research3."
friedrich-schiller-universität-jena.md,"It is recommended, and also required by some funding organisations, to create and submit a data management plan (DMP). A DMP contains the requirements as well as the technical and organisational measures ensuring a sustainable handling of research data during, and after, the project life-time. Throughout a project the DMP serves as a reference and guideline. It may evolve over time if conditions or requirements change (keyword: living document)."
friedrich-schiller-universität-jena.md,"Most funding organisations expect not only the long-term safekeeping of research data but also its publication. A suitable strategy should be determined in the proposal phase. Costs for research data management (e.g. labour, storage, publication), which cannot be covered by the university's basic facilities, should be requested in the proposal. The university computer centre assists you in determining the necessary IT infrastructure and services."
friedrich-schiller-universität-jena.md,"While planning a research project, in particular, when publishing results, legal constraints apply and must be taken into account. Certain research data in the social sciences, life sciences and medicine, for example, are subject to strict conditions, such as privacy protection laws or require prior assessment by an ethics committee. Additionally, the protection of copyrights and legitimate interests of third parties must be ensured. It is recommended to clarify legal questions in advance while planning a research project. The legal department4 is there to advise you on these matters."
friedrich-schiller-universität-jena.md,## II. Implementation phase: during the research project
friedrich-schiller-universität-jena.md,"Storing and processing, as well as collaborating on research data, should adhere to state-of-the-art IT principles. This includes, first and foremost, securing data in terms of accessibility, integrity (unaltered) and authenticity. For example, procedures for data backups and archiving need to be in place and secure data exchange platforms and versioning tools should be used."
friedrich-schiller-universität-jena.md,In terms of research data the university computer centre (URZ)5 provides (among other things) the following services. The services are offered partly free of charge as basic infrastructure or can be provided at net cost.
friedrich-schiller-universität-jena.md,use of network file systems (including data backup)
friedrich-schiller-universität-jena.md,mass storage (archive storage) including data mirroring
friedrich-schiller-universität-jena.md,renting virtual servers (server hosting)
friedrich-schiller-universität-jena.md,accommodation of real servers (server housing)
friedrich-schiller-universität-jena.md,block storage services for servers (virtual disks via a dedicated storage
friedrich-schiller-universität-jena.md,network)
friedrich-schiller-universität-jena.md,data exchange services
friedrich-schiller-universität-jena.md,versioning services
friedrich-schiller-universität-jena.md,long-term archiving services (in cooperation with ThULB)
friedrich-schiller-universität-jena.md,Detailed service descriptions are available on the URZ website.
friedrich-schiller-universität-jena.md,"The reusability of research data is largely dependent on the availability and quality of accompanying metadata. Metadata is data about data and provides the context in which the data were created. As a rule of thumb, metadata should answer the classic six questions: Who? What? Why? How? When? Where? Metadata is a prerequisite enabling potential users to find data and assess its suitability for the intended use. Ideally, the description is structured and machine-readable. For this purpose, metadata standards and standardized terminologies exist in most disciplines. If these do not exist, generic standards, such as Dublin Core, MARC, or MODS, should be used."
friedrich-schiller-universität-jena.md,"In the implementation phase of a project, datasets may evolve over several stages (e.g. by selection, aggregation, integration). It is good practice to label, document and keep the different versions at least for the duration of the project. Especially in the case of text-based data, the use of versioning tools (e.g. git, SVN) helps with the management of different versions."
friedrich-schiller-universität-jena.md,"In collaborative projects or projects with large amounts of data, the use of dedicated software and infrastructure for data management is advisable. Operating these infrastructures usually requires additional resources, but they provide the advantage of a streamlined central management for research data. Finding and sharing research data is thereby facilitated, but should be governed by a data policy the project consortium agreed upon."
friedrich-schiller-universität-jena.md,## III. Final phase: after completion of the research project
friedrich-schiller-universität-jena.md,"According to good scientific practice, research data must be archived and made available by the end of a project. In particular, public access has become a necessity in recent years in order to facilitate the traceability of research results as well as subsequent reuse of the data. It is recommended to publish research data following the principle ""as open as possible, as restricted as necessary""."
friedrich-schiller-universität-jena.md,"There are various ways to publish research data. In addition to domain-agnostic repositories, a large number of discipline-specific repositories exist. To find a suitable repository for your research data, the portal re3data.org 6  provides extensive search and filter capabilities. In addition, there are special data journals for publishing research data. In some disciplines it is common practice to publish data as a supplement to the respective article. However, this form of data publication has the disadvantage that the data can only be found via the article and does not form an independent, citable publication object"
friedrich-schiller-universität-jena.md,"When selecting a publication method, the following criteria should be taken into account: long-term availability (at least 10 years), allocation of persistent identifiers (e.g. DOI, URN), licensing and usage terms of the data, visibility and cost."
friedrich-schiller-universität-jena.md,"As a member of the FSU, you may publish and archive research data with the Digital Library of Thuringia (DBT)7."
friedrich-schiller-universität-jena.md,"If you published research data with an external repository, you are requested to register this publication with the Digital Library Thuringia, too."
friedrich-schiller-universität-jena.md,"Individual websites (e.g. of projects, departments, employees) are generally not suitable for the publication of research data. The long-term availability of such websites is often not guaranteed and non-ambiguous identification (keyword: PID) and cross-referencing is limited."
friedrich-schiller-universität-jena.md,"When selecting the data to be published, the DFG (2015) recommends, ""Data should be made accessible at a stage of processing that allows it to be usefully reused by third parties (raw data or structured data)."" In particular, data that served as the foundation of a scientific article should be made public."
friedrich-schiller-universität-jena.md,"As with scientific articles, research data should also receive a unique, persistent identifier (PID). A PID (e.g. DOI, URN) is typically provided by the repository or data journal at the time of publication. In order to mandate usage and exploitation rights of your research data, data should always be published with a corresponding license. The selected license should allow at least open access for scientific purposes. Specific requirements of the funding organisation or repositories may apply and need to be considered. Suitable data licenses are available from Open Data Commons8 or the Creative Commons9. In general, research data should be published as soon as possible. However, there may be reasons to publish research data with an embargo period. In this case, the data is submitted to the repository for archiving, but it is only accessible after the end of the embargo period. The researchers who are responsible for the data determine the length of the embargo period, unless otherwise requested by the policies and guidelines of funding organisations or the repositories. Embargo periods should not exceed 1-2 years after the end of the project."
friedrich-schiller-universität-jena.md,Vorstehende Handlungsempfehlung wurde am 20. Dezember 2016 durch den Senat der Friedrich-Schiller-Universität Jena beschlossen.

ghent-university.md,# FACULTY GUIDELINES RESEARCH DATA MANAGEMENT
ghent-university.md,"Approved by the Faculty Board on November 10th, 2016"
ghent-university.md,"On September 2nd, 2016, the UGent policy framework for research data management1 was approved by the Executive Board. This general policy framework is a guideline for the proper management of research data and defines the objectives, starting points and responsibilities to comply with this. Given the large differences between and within the different scientific domains, the faculties are given the authority to take initiatives. These initiatives must encourage and support faculty researchers with careful data management in accordance with the UGent policy framework. The guidelines below are therefore complementary to the general policy framework. While following these guidelines, legal, ethical and valorisation arguments must always be considered."
ghent-university.md,## Planning
ghent-university.md,"At the start of each research project or a series of related studies, a data management plan (DMP) is made available by the responsible researcher. To help, use can be made of the faculty template on DMPOnline.be. This DMP is kept up-to-date as the project progresses."
ghent-university.md,### Storage & preservation of research data
ghent-university.md,"Where possible, research data is stored (during a project) and preserved (after a project) on a central network drive (i.e.., a UGent share managed by DICT)."
ghent-university.md,"The researcher gives at least reading rights on the network disk to his hierarchical superior using the following functional sequence: doctoral student < (co-)promotor2/ZAP < chair department < chair CWO). With an eye toward the structured storage of research data, researchers are provided with 'best practice' examples. The objective is to use a uniform folder structure for each type of data."
ghent-university.md,"When a researcher leaves the university, he/she and his/her supervisor take the initiative to keep the research data and accompanying documentation available and accessible during the applicable preservation period."
ghent-university.md,"Non-digital research data should preferably be digitized. If this is not possible, it should be stored in the faculty archive for research data."
ghent-university.md,### Findability & comprehensibility of research data
ghent-university.md,Research data are documented to such an extent that reproduction of the reported results and reuse of the data is possible.
ghent-university.md,"For every publication of which the first author is a UGent employee, a data storage fact sheet is made. This is then added to Biblio and provided with the 'data fact sheet' tag3."
ghent-university.md,## Support
ghent-university.md,Novice PhD students are advised to follow the RDM workshop organized at the beginning of each academic year.
ghent-university.md,"For advice and assistance with all aspects of good data management, you can contact the faculty Research Support Office (RSO)."

glasgow-school-of-art.md,## 1.  Introduction
glasgow-school-of-art.md,This policy outlines the approach of Glasgow School of Art in relation to research data management and curation.
glasgow-school-of-art.md,"Within the context of this policy, research data should be interpreted as any material (whether digital or analogue) that underpins the production of research outputs."
glasgow-school-of-art.md,"Research data means data in the form of facts, observations, images, computer program results, recordings, measurements or experiences on which a research output is based. Data may be numerical, descriptive, visual or tactile. It may be raw, cleaned or processed, and may be held in any format or media. Research data in the visual arts mirrors the complexity of the outputs, taking many forms including logbooks, journals, workbooks, sample libraries, sketchbooks, sets of images, video recordings, trials, prototypes, ceramic glaze recipes, found objects, and correspondence. Provenance information about the data might also be included: the how, when, where it was collected and with what (for example, instrument). This metadata facilitates later interpretation and re-use of data."
glasgow-school-of-art.md,Modern research and publishing environments provide increased opportunities to make research data openly available in order to:
glasgow-school-of-art.md,validate research outputs increase and measure impact facilitate knowledge exchange communicate research to wider society
glasgow-school-of-art.md,"The Glasgow School of Art recognises that its research data is a key asset that can be managed to maximise benefits to the individual researcher, wider society, our funders and stakeholders, and the School."
glasgow-school-of-art.md,## 2. Principles
glasgow-school-of-art.md,### 2.1 General
glasgow-school-of-art.md,"1. Research produced by the School’s researchers, staff and students should strive to achieve the highest standards of integrity and quality"
glasgow-school-of-art.md,"2. Research data will be managed in line with wider School policies, guidelines and standards, and the requirements of external funders"
glasgow-school-of-art.md,### 2.2 Communication and Dissemination
glasgow-school-of-art.md,"3. The Research Information Manager and Heads of Schools are charged with communicating this policy to their researchers, along with the importance of good data management in general"
glasgow-school-of-art.md,### 2.3 Management Plans
glasgow-school-of-art.md,"4. Research proposals should include research data management plans where appropriate. These plans will generally consider data capture, management and curation, storage, handling, retention, dissemination, and publication"
glasgow-school-of-art.md,5. Lead researchers are responsible for ensuring that research data management requirements are observed at all stages of a research project
glasgow-school-of-art.md,"6. The Research Information Manager will provide guidance and support to help researchers negotiate the deposit, storage, retention and dissemination of research data"

hasselt-university.md,# General policy plan on research data management at Hasselt University
hasselt-university.md,## Introduction
hasselt-university.md,"The sound management of research data is essential to high-quality and responsible scholarly research. Hasselt University sees to the quality of the research performed within the institution and by researchers affiliated to the institution. It has already undertaken various initiatives to warrant such high-quality and responsible research, e.g. by subscribing to the Code of Ethics for Scientific Research in Belgium and the European Charter for Researchers, by establishing a Commission on Scientific Integrity, and by drawing up the Integrity Charter. In addition, research data turn out to be key to uphold high-quality research. By implementing a policy plan on research data management Hasselt University aims to manage its research data in the best manner possible."
hasselt-university.md,"This policy plan on research data management at Hasselt University outlines the basic principles and general guidelines for the secure, findable, accessible and understandable preservation, for the management, the reuse (if possible) and the (public) sharing and archiving of research data at Hasselt University for the purpose of (re)use, verification or data collection. It lays down a general framework within which researchers, employees and students at Hasselt University manage their research data in a high-quality manner. These basic principles and general guidelines are based on both national and international developments in the field of research data management, and should be read together with the related regulations and guidelines, as listed in attachment 1 to this policy plan."

hasselt-university.md,"This policy plan applies to all research data that are generated, collected, processed, preserved, archived or exchanged before, during or after the research project at Hasselt University by researchers within the framework of their affiliation to Hasselt University."
hasselt-university.md,"Unless explicitly stated otherwise, this policy plan likewise applies to students within the framework of their affiliation to Hasselt University."
hasselt-university.md,## 3. Basic principles
hasselt-university.md,The basic principles of this policy plan on research data management are:
hasselt-university.md,"1. During the entire research data life cycle, each researcher at Hasselt University must store, preserve and manage his/her high-quality data, and make them as (publicly) available as possible for potential reuse. In addition, research data must be managed as required by third parties, including funders, collaborating partners and government agencies. Each researcher at Hasselt University must observe and implement the basic principles and general guidelines, as set forth in this policy plan on research data management, before, during and after each scholarly research project."
hasselt-university.md,"2. This policy plan on research data management complements existing legislation and regulations, and further specifies contractual obligations, research ethics and integrity guidelines. Personal data can only be collected and used when essential for a specific research question."
hasselt-university.md,4. All research projects require a data management plan (see art. 6).
hasselt-university.md,"5. Researchers must comply with the current guidelines regarding the correct use of his/her Hasselt University user account, as set forth in the Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). Access rights to certain data are granted following the Identity and Access Management (IAM) procedures. The premises and infrastructure of Hasselt University are only accessible for researchers and individuals with a valid access permission."
hasselt-university.md,## 4. Support by Hasselt University
hasselt-university.md,### 4.1 Collaboration
hasselt-university.md,"In this policy plan on research data management, Hasselt University takes the lead by outlining the basic principles and general guidelines. Pivotal is the collaboration between Hasselt University, the researchers, the faculties, the research groups, the research institutes and the central administration."
hasselt-university.md,### 4.2 Awareness
hasselt-university.md,Hasselt University commits itself to stimulate researchers to implement this policy plan on research data management by promoting and facilitating it.
hasselt-university.md,"The central administration offers support by providing training, advice, guidelines and templates for managing research data and writing data management plans. In addition, the basic principles and general guidelines of this policy plan are further explained on the portal site of the university. Through the funds obtained from the Flemish Open Science Board, the central administration of Hasselt University also offers support to researchers of the Limburg Association of Higher Education (AUHL)."
hasselt-university.md,### 4.3 Support
hasselt-university.md,"Besides this policy plan on research data management, Hasselt University is working on guidelines in order to meet both the practical and the technical needs of researchers, faculties, research groups and research institutes. Because of the considerable differences in data types and related data handling practices and needs between and within the various scholarly disciplines in which research is performed at Hasselt University, this policy plan on research data management aims to provide a general framework upon which the various disciplines can build. To this end, researchers can call upon the data steward who is assigned to their specific discipline."
hasselt-university.md,## 5. Management of research data
hasselt-university.md,"Each researcher should essentially take the responsibility for the optimal management of high-quality research data. This implies that each researcher ensures that all research data are provided with documentation and adequate metadata that are prerequisites to enable the understanding and reuse of these research data. In order to store and describe research data in a high-quality manner, Hasselt University offers support with the implementation of a selection of Electronic Lab Notebooks (ELN)."
hasselt-university.md,## 6. Data management plan
hasselt-university.md,"The researcher must write an initial data management plan within six months of the official start of the research project. In this plan, (s)he will describe the procedures for collecting, storing, (re)using, accessing, archiving and destroying the research data before, during and after the research project. This initial data management plan should be updated throughout the project. A final version must be submitted after the end of the research project."
hasselt-university.md,"Both the initial data management plan at the start and the final version after the end of the research project must be submitted to the Directorate Research, Library and Internationalisation at Hasselt University (rdm@uhasselt.be). In addition, an external funding agency can require to receive one or both versions of the data management plan."
hasselt-university.md,"Each data management plan must comply with the basic principles and general guidelines, as set out in this policy plan, as well as with the policy or requirements, as set out by third parties. To this end, Hasselt University provides the necessary tools that are available to all researchers at Hasselt University."
hasselt-university.md,## 7. Relevant regulations
hasselt-university.md,"The researcher is responsible for observing the relevant regulations. These include, without being limited to:"
hasselt-university.md,intellectual property rights;
hasselt-university.md,"research ethics, as laid down, for instance, in the ALLEA European Code of Conduct; privacy legislation, including the General Data Protection Regulation nr. 2016/679;"
hasselt-university.md,the European Dual-Use Regulation nr. 428/2009;
hasselt-university.md,"the European Regulation nr. 511/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 on compliance measures for users from the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization in the Union, and The Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from Their Utilization to the Convention on Biological Diversity, 29 October 2010;"
hasselt-university.md,the Hasselt University Information Security Policy Plan;
hasselt-university.md,"the Acceptable Use Policy with regard to the security and the storage of data, as defined by the Information Security Committee of Hasselt University;"
hasselt-university.md,"any additional regulations, as laid down in agreements with third parties, and any additional requirements, as laid down in the regulations of external funding agencies (see attachment 1, §1)."
hasselt-university.md,"In case that the regulations of external funding agencies or the agreements with third parties contain more severe or specific requirements regarding research data management, these will prevail over the general guidelines and principles set out in this policy plan."
hasselt-university.md,## 8. Security of personal and confidential research data
hasselt-university.md,"When research data contain personal or otherwise confidential information, the researcher should observe the following provisions. As a matter of fact, similar measures necessary to prevent access"
hasselt-university.md,"by unauthorized parties should be taken to protect not only digital data, but also confidential information on physical carriers (e.g. survey responses on paper)."
hasselt-university.md,"Hasselt University provides tools that can be used by all researchers at the university. Through its portal site, the university offers technical and practical support."
hasselt-university.md,### 8.1 Anonymizing research data
hasselt-university.md,Researchers should always try to process anonymous research data as much as possible. Anonymized research data don’t relate to an identified or identifiable natural person; these personal data are rendered anonymous in such a manner that the data subject is no longer identifiable.
hasselt-university.md,"It is advised to document the anonymization techniques used and the related risk analysis in detail, e.g. in a so-called ‘Anonymization Pseudonymization Plan’ (APP)."
hasselt-university.md,### 8.2 Pseudonymizing research data
hasselt-university.md,Research data containing personal information can be pseudonymized. The use of pseudonymized data is only allowed if the additional information on these pseudonymized data is kept separately and is subject to technical and organizational measures to ensure that the personal data are not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person.
hasselt-university.md,"It is advised to document the pseudonymization techniques used and the related risk analysis in detail, e.g. in a so-called ‘Anonymization Pseudonymization Plan’ (APP)."
hasselt-university.md,### 8.3 Encrypting research data
hasselt-university.md,Research data should be encrypted as much as possible. That is to say that data should be encoded as to protect the information contained. It is advised to assign the task of encrypting to an expert at the Central Information Technology Service (CID).
hasselt-university.md,### 8.4 Confidential research data
hasselt-university.md,"Researchers should always be aware of the implications of non-disclosure agreements protecting confidential research data, and should respect this confidentiality. When the researcher feels that certain research data should be treated confidentially although an agreement with the third party concerned is still lacking, (s)he is responsible for reporting this lacuna to Tech Transfer Office (TTO), so that an agreement can still be drafted."
hasselt-university.md,## 9. Storage and preservation of research data
hasselt-university.md,### 9.1 Basic principles
hasselt-university.md,"Before, during and after a research project at Hasselt University, research data can be recorded in high-quality facilities as provided by Hasselt University. Through its portal site, the university offers technical and practical support."
hasselt-university.md,"However, in case research data are managed in external facilities, the researcher will clearly indicate this in the data management plan and clarify how, when and by whom these data can be consulted."
hasselt-university.md,### 9.2 Storage and backup of research data during the research project
hasselt-university.md,Storage of research data during the research project
hasselt-university.md,"Preferably, researchers make use of the facilities provided by Hasselt University (e.g. Google Drive). (S)He should use a shared storage platform (e.g. Google Shared drive). Via such shared platform, one should share his/her research data with his/her hierarchical responsible and, if applicable, with the members of the research group. The alternative of a personal storage platform (e.g. Google My drive) should only be used for personal (yet work-related) files, or if collaboration with partners within or outside Hasselt University is not necessary."
hasselt-university.md,"However, if researchers choose to make use of external facilities, they should first seek permission to do so via the IT Service Desk. In this case, the researcher himself/herself and his/her hierarchical responsible accept responsibility for the high-quality storage of the research data."
hasselt-university.md,"Finally, researchers are strongly discouraged from using media that are highly susceptible to damage and loss to store their research data, including e.g. local hard drives, external hard drives, USB drives, etc."
hasselt-university.md,### Backup of research data during the research project
hasselt-university.md,"A backup is essential to safeguard important and valuable research data in case of loss of or damage to the data on the original carrier. If one makes use of the institutional facilities mentioned above, such backup strategy will be provided by default. However, if one chooses to make use of an external facility, the researcher himself/herself will be responsible for implementing a backup strategy. For more information, one should contact the Central Information Technology Service (CID)."
hasselt-university.md,### 9.3 Preservation of research data after the end of the research project
hasselt-university.md,"Research data that were generated or collected within the framework of a completed research experiment or analysis, and that the researcher considers to be valuable for (re)use, verification, valorization or data collection, should be preserved. Moreover, when the research data are part of a scholarly publication or patent application, they must be preserved in any case."
hasselt-university.md,"Research data should be preserved in their most original (or raw) condition in order to make (re)use, verification, valorization and data collection possible. In addition, the data should be preserved as far as possible in a standardized (that is, uniform) and safe manner and – if applicable – in accordance with international disciplinary guidelines. This implies that the researcher takes into account (legal) requirements on anonymization, pseudonymization and encryption, as set forth in §8. Similarly, the researcher should comply with the guidelines concerning data management, as formulated by the Information Security Committee (see attachment 1, §7). In addition, research data should always be accompanied by the documentation that is necessary to understand their origin, generation, collection, processing and analysis."
hasselt-university.md,"For archiving research data after the end of a research project, researchers preferably make use of an external disciplinary database, next of the institutional repository or cloud-based facilities provided by Hasselt University, and finally of an external general database."
hasselt-university.md,### 9.4 Preservation period
hasselt-university.md,"After the research experiment and analysis have been wrapped up, the raw research data that are relevant for (re)use, verification, valorization or data collection, must be preserved for a period of minimum five years, at least insofar as legal, contractual or disciplinary regulations don’t deviate herefrom. If the research data contain personal data, the researcher should always comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). If the research data are part of a publication, this term can be extended to a period of minimum five years after the official date of publication."
hasselt-university.md,"In addition, if the costs for data curation are in proportion to the academic, socio-cultural or economic added value of the (relevant) research data, the latter can be archived for the longer term, that is after the minimum preservation period of five years has elapsed. Such long-term preservation is only decided upon in close consultation with the researcher or his/her hierarchical responsible."
hasselt-university.md,### 9.5 Disposal of research data
hasselt-university.md,"Researchers should destroy research data that are not (no longer) relevant for (re)use, verification, valorization or data collection – at least insofar as legal, contractual or disciplinary regulations don’t deviate herefrom. Besides, researchers leaving Hasselt University should comply with yet additional measures, as set forth in §12."
hasselt-university.md,### 9.6 Hasselt University Metadata Repository for research data
hasselt-university.md,"Researchers at Hasselt University are required to submit the descriptive metadata of their datasets resulting from research at Hasselt University, whether or not underlying a peer-reviewed publication, to the Metadata Repository. The latter is integrated in the institutional repository of Hasselt University (Document Server), in which researchers currently already deposit their publications and other research outputs."
hasselt-university.md,## 10. Intellectual property rights to inventions
hasselt-university.md,"The intellectual property rights to inventions belong to Hasselt University, with the exception of inventions by students. Researchers, with the exception of students, must disclose inventions to Hasselt University Tech Transfer Office (TTO), prior to any other disclosure. TTO is responsible for protecting (e.g. by filing a patent application) and valorizing (e.g. by granting rights of use to third parties) these inventions."
hasselt-university.md,"However, the researchers involved retain all moral paternity rights. In addition, in accordance with the AUHL valorization regulations, they are entitled to compensation in case their valorized inventions generate income."
hasselt-university.md,"On the other hand, in case of inventions by students, intellectual property rights belong to the student himself/herself, as is set out in the ‘Regulations concerning the rights to research results and rights to copyright works of bachelor’s and master’s students at Hasselt University, tUL and partner institutions in a joint study programme’."
hasselt-university.md,"If students produce inventions that are part of research at Hasselt University, arrangements should be made so that Hasselt University is able to protect and valorize these inventions, or otherwise. In this case, the supervisor of the student should inform TTO in time."
hasselt-university.md,## 11. Reuse of research data
hasselt-university.md,### 11.1 Reuse by a third party
hasselt-university.md,"When a researcher at Hasselt University requests to use the research data of another researcher at Hasselt University, the hierarchical responsible of the latter researcher is authorized to grant or deny access. The hierarchical responsible tries to discuss this first with the researcher as far as possible before granting access. In this regard, the interests of the researcher at Hasselt University will always prevail. Supplementary conditions upon which access is granted, can be added by the hierarchical responsible."
hasselt-university.md,"When an external party requests to use the research data of a researcher at Hasselt University, or, conversely, a researcher at Hasselt University requests to use the research data of an external party, TTO should be informed in order that the proper written agreement can be drafted, in accordance with the Hasselt University Delegation Act (see attachment 1)."
hasselt-university.md,### 11.2 Public sharing
hasselt-university.md,"Examples of public sharing include: depositing research data in publicly accessible databases or repositories, presenting research data at conferences (unless the conference takes place within a closed network and a confidentiality agreement was concluded), sharing research data via social media, publicly exhibiting art works, etc."
hasselt-university.md,## 12. Researchers leaving Hasselt University
hasselt-university.md,"Research data that are collected and/or generated within the framework of a research project at Hasselt University, must be preserved and remain accessible for the appropriate period of time by the hierarchical responsible of the researcher leaving Hasselt University, unless contractual agreements with third parties deviate from this principle."
hasselt-university.md,"As set forth in §10 of this policy plan, the intellectual property rights to inventions belong to Hasselt University, with the exception of inventions by students in a bachelor or master programme, or in a bridging or preparatory course. By consequence, a researcher is not allowed to take his/her invention with him/her upon leaving Hasselt University."
hasselt-university.md,"Researchers collaborating with other researchers or with third parties should make clear written arrangements concerning the management of the research data involved at the start of the research project. Such agreements concerning the management of research data in collaboration with external parties are laid down by the Tech Transfer Office, with regard for the Hasselt University Delegation Act."
hasselt-university.md,"In case research data need to be disposed of, written consent by the researcher and by his/her hierarchical responsible is necessary. This written consent contains an elaborate motivation clarifying and approving both the specific datasets concerned and the reasons to destroy them. The researcher will provide the Central Information Technology Service of Hasselt University with this document. In addition, the destruction of the data itself should comply with applicable regulations (see attachment 1); the researcher leaving Hasselt University bears this responsibility."
hasselt-university.md,"Finally, the researcher leaving Hasselt University must observe the regulations concerning the processing of reusable and old devices, (research) data, media and documents, as drafted by the Information Security Committee, in order to prevent that the data that are stored on these devices should fall into the hands of unauthorized parties (see attachment 1, §7)."

helmholtz-munich.md,# Research Data Policy of the  Helmholtz Center Munich
helmholtz-munich.md,## 1. Introduction
helmholtz-munich.md,"Helmholtz Zentrum München, Deutsches Forschungszentrum für Gesundheit und Umwelt GmbH (hereafter Helmholtz Munich) recognizes the fundamental importance of research data and encourages all scientists to apply the highest standards when handling these data within their projects (for the definition of ""research data"" see 8.1. 3). This implies that accurate and easily retrievable research data must be an integral part of any research project at the center so that it reflects the scientific culture of our research activities recognized in society and in the scientific community. A generally binding research data policy is not only necessary for the verification and validation of research results, but also forms the basic prerequisite for open, transparent and networked science (Open Science Policy)."
helmholtz-munich.md,"Due to the dynamics of the use of new analytical instruments, research data from current and also from already completed projects can generate additional value for future scientific projects. However, this can only be realized and protected if the data obtained is already protected against loss during the course of the project and if it remains reusable for future projects thanks to its format, the link with corresponding metadata and the assignment of persistent identifiers (DOI). Securing the research data obtained at the center for subsequent use is an essential prerequisite for future innovative (meta)analyses, e.g. to gain new knowledge on the complex interactions between environmental factors and human health."
helmholtz-munich.md,## 2. Aim of this Research Data Policy at Helmholtz Munich
helmholtz-munich.md,"• The aim of securing the research data obtained at the center so that it can be reused for future projects is being pursued in the knowledge that the center's material and financial resources are provided by the public sector. Therefore, the center feels obliged to use the research results obtained with the greatest possible potential for broad application in society."
helmholtz-munich.md,"• With the implementation of a generally applicable research data guideline, including appropriate regulations for standardization, maximum synergy effects should be achieved by creating the basis for linking data sets from different projects."
helmholtz-munich.md,"• In particular, the research data guidelines also ensure that the research data already obtained at the center can be reused for future scientific questions (1, 2)."
helmholtz-munich.md,"• A generally applicable research data guideline for the Helmholtz Zentrum München facilitates cooperation with research institutions in Germany and abroad and increases the visibility of the center in the international science community through the principles of Open Science (2, 3)."
helmholtz-munich.md,## 3. Scope of this Research Data Policy
helmholtz-munich.md,"The following guideline for handling research data applies to all employees of the Helmholtz Zentrum München, regardless of how the respective research project is financed (basic funding or funding by grants). It is also used - within the framework of the respective contractual agreements - for research data that was / will be obtained in the context of cooperation with external partners."
helmholtz-munich.md,"All employees of the center must follow this guideline when handling research data, regardless of the legal basis of their employment (as permanent researchers, employees on temporary projects, visiting scientists, scholarship holders, etc.)."
helmholtz-munich.md,"The Center's current guidelines on data protection and information security, as well as the guidelines on the storage of and access rights to research data, take precedence over this guideline. In particular, research data as carriers of intellectual property may require protection (IP guideline of the center). Your exploitation rights by the center or third-party donors have priority over their publication (see 8.1.6) and must not be jeopardized by an open data culture."
helmholtz-munich.md,Exceptions to the research data guidelines can only be granted in justified cases. They always require verification/approval by the INNO and SPR departments.
helmholtz-munich.md,## 4. Research Data Management
helmholtz-munich.md,"Research data management covers the entire life cycle of research data, from the creation of a data management plan (DMP) to the collection of primary data, their validation, aggregation to permanent archiving and their publication."
helmholtz-munich.md,"Research data must be recorded in accordance with the relevant standards of the respective research discipline, stating the tools and methods used to generate and process them. These metadata records contain descriptions of the data context in the long term and to publish them if necessary. Your archiving should be retrievable, readable, exchangeable and reusable according to the four premises of the FAIR data standard (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable) (4). The link to their metadata should be made using the established and standardized terminology of the relevant discipline, taking into account the possibility of interdisciplinary reusability and interoperability (5)."
helmholtz-munich.md,"The handling of research data within the framework of defined projects follows the DMP, which is created before the project begins (6). The planned type of research data, its acquisition, storage and access options to the data are to be specified in the DMP and the respective responsible parties are to be named. In the case of technical or methodological changes in the data flow during the course of a project, the DMP must be adapted. In the case of third-party funded projects, the costs incurred for the implementation of the DMP must be taken into account as eligible expenses when applying for funding. The project funding department of the SPR department advises applicants, e.g. B. on the basis of data management plans already established in other projects."
helmholtz-munich.md,## 5. Responsibilities
helmholtz-munich.md,### 5.1 Every researcher is responsible for:
helmholtz-munich.md,"A. the administration and management of research data (sets) in accordance with the principles and requirements of these guidelines and in accordance with the rules for ensuring good scientific practice of the Helmholtz Zentrum München (7), B. the collection, documentation, archiving and protection against loss of research data including researchrelated records (metadata). For this, the corresponding DMP is to be used, which specifies standard operating procedures that define the collection, administration, integrity, confidentiality, storage and publication of the data obtained."
helmholtz-munich.md,"C. Compliance with the general guidelines of the center, in the case of third-party funded projects, also the guidelines of the sponsors, and in the case of cooperation projects with external (research) partners, the relevant contractual regulations. The special requirements of the specific individual case must be specified in the DMP."
helmholtz-munich.md,### 5.2 Each project leader (PL) is responsible for:
helmholtz-munich.md,"A. The creation and implementation of the data management plan (DMP) for the respective project. In addition to technical questions regarding the collection, administration, integrity, confidentiality, storage and publication of the data, compliance with the general guidelines of the center and the sponsors must also be taken into account in order to - wherever possible -"
helmholtz-munich.md,"B. to ensure the reusability and exchangeability of the research data after the end of the project. In particular, this includes the definition of data reuse rights with the assignment of appropriate licenses, as well as the clarification of data storage and archiving with persistent DOIs after the project has been completed."
helmholtz-munich.md,"C. the possible specified destruction of research data and research-related records for data that falls within the scope of the European data protection BER as personal data (patient data, test person data (cohorts)). This also applies in particular to the revocation of consent by data subjects."
helmholtz-munich.md,D. The provision of suitable resources (technical / organizational) to enable FAIR-compatible data management for all employees within the project.
helmholtz-munich.md,### 5.3. Helmholtz Munich / Research Data Management (RDM) / HA DigIT
helmholtz-munich.md,"A. For research data management, the center provides support through RDM and other participating units (INNO, RA, ZB, SPR project funding) in the form of regular training, targeted advice (including questions about IP, ethics, etc.). Software is available for the standardized creation of DMPs."
helmholtz-munich.md,"The use of ""electronic laboratory notebooks"" (ELN) is supported to create valid and high-quality research (meta)data and minimize data loss."
helmholtz-munich.md,B. The technical requirements for long-term archiving of research data and the associated metadata (research data repositories) are provided by the center.
helmholtz-munich.md,## 6. Publication of scientific findings including Research Data
helmholtz-munich.md,"Research data should be made publicly accessible (publications, patents, etc.) immediately after they have been used for the first time by researchers at the center, unless there are significant reasons to the contrary. These can be, for example, legal or contractual regulations or the use of data from other research projects with a non-permissive license, the protection of intellectual property or the intended use of the data as part of technology transfer. The scope of the intended initial use must be specified in the respective DMP. In the case of contracts with external cooperation partners and guest scientists, care must be taken to ensure that no contractual commitments are entered into that would stand in the way of the publication of results involving the center. Advice on this may be provided by SPR project funding and/or the LA department."
helmholtz-munich.md,"When it comes to making the research data accessible after initial use (for instance in the form of a peer reviewed research paper), the focus is on traceability and reusability of the data in accordance with the FAIR principles (see above). For this purpose, the research data repositories of the center or external repositories are to be used. The Helmholtz Zentrum München provides tools for this and advises the project leaders on how to use them."
helmholtz-munich.md,"If the research data is made publicly accessible, this should be done under a CC-SA  license if possible. As far as is feasible, data that has not yet been published but is worthy of publication should subsequently be made freely accessible and - linked to a DOI - published in the form of citable data publications. The DOI is assigned by the central library of Helmholtz Munich."
helmholtz-munich.md,## 7. Annex
helmholtz-munich.md,### 7.1 Definitions
helmholtz-munich.md,#### 7.1.1 Data Management Plan (DMP)
helmholtz-munich.md,"In order to ensure sustainable data management, a data management plan (DMP) must be drawn up before the start of a research project. It is intended to ensure systematic and permanent handling of the research data generated as part of a research project. In addition, he goes into the copyright, usage, access and first exploitation rights as well as storage during and after the end of the research project."
helmholtz-munich.md,#### 7.1.2 Researcher/Scientist
helmholtz-munich.md,"Scientists are all employees of the research center who are active in research and have a university degree, including bachelor’s and master’s students and guests with the appropriate qualifications."
helmholtz-munich.md,#### 7.1.3 Research Data (RD)
helmholtz-munich.md,"Research data is all data that is created during the research process, is used for it or is the result of it. Depending on the specific research question and using various methods, they are generated or collected, observed, simulated or derived, then processed, validated, further processed, analyzed, published and finally archived. Accordingly, research data occurs in every research discipline and depending on the stage of its life cycle in different media types and formats, aggregation and quality levels. Research data that form the basis of a publication are part of the scientific output of the center's scientists."
helmholtz-munich.md,#### 7.1.4 Metadata
helmholtz-munich.md,"Metadata describe research data. On the one hand, they include authorship(s), contact details of the originator (organization), time of creation, licenses and keywords. They define the data formats used and contain the context that led to the data. In addition, metadata can include device settings, environmental conditions (e.g. temperatures, pressures), comments and measurement uncertainties. Metadata are essential for the subsequent use of research data. In addition to use for further research work, this subsequent use also includes verification of research results by third parties."
helmholtz-munich.md,#### 7.1.5 Research Data Management (RDM)
helmholtz-munich.md,"The term research data management refers to the handling of research data from planning, generation and processing to publication, long-term archiving and, if necessary, deletion in compliance with the rules for safeguarding good scientific practice and the European GDPR. The management of research data therefore affects the entire life cycle of research data."
helmholtz-munich.md,"In addition, the term includes the subject-specific documentation of the processes in the context of their collection. DMP facilitate the documentation of these processes and the description of the data."
helmholtz-munich.md,#### 7.1.6 Protection of Intellectual Property and the priority right for RD exploitation
helmholtz-munich.md,The need for protection and the exploitation rights of intellectual property (IP) are defined in the employment contract between the researcher and the center as worker or host and are described in detail in the current IP guideline of the center. Copyright and exploitation rights to all forms of intellectual property can be expanded or specified by further agreements (e.g. third-party funding contracts).
helmholtz-munich.md,"In principle, Helmholtz Munich has the right to decide how research data can be published and shared as a carrier of intellectual property. The treatment of all research data according to the FAIR principles represents the basis for publications and data exchange, but does not enforce the latter. The need for protection of the intellectual property resulting from the research of the center has priority over the exchange of data within the framework of a future open science policy."
helmholtz-munich.md,"The first use of research data is usually one or more text publication(s) in a journal based on this data. The scope and duration of the initial use can be determined by the scientists in the DMP. In particular, the end of the initial exploitation phase should be determined in a context-dependent and justified manner."
helmholtz-munich.md,#### 7.1.7 Data Publication
helmholtz-munich.md,Data sets can be published in two ways:
helmholtz-munich.md,"A. by simply making them available via a web interface, preferably at a local data repository of Helmholtz Munich,  or via a citable, dedicated  data publication (linked with a DOI). Such a data publication can include the open distribution of the data and metadata, but does not have to.  Instead it can also  show a simple ""landing page"", which broadly describe the context and content of the data set and via which interested parties can submit a request to the respective decentralized data manager (see above under ""Responsibilities and responsibilities"") for data release."
helmholtz-munich.md,"A central technical tool for the publication of research data is a data repository, a server service on which data can be stored by its creators. This data is given a globally unique identifier (e.g. a DOI) and can be searched and, if necessary, downloaded. A restriction of access by the data producer(s) by means of authorization settings is possible depending on the respective repository."
helmholtz-munich.md,#### 7.1.8 Licences
helmholtz-munich.md,"The license of a publication is a contract between the publishing and re-using person or institution, which regulates the conditions of re-use. Many license ""types"" are already pre-formulated and are available on the Internet, so reference is made to them here (8). A permissive license restricts subsequent use only minimally. Well-known examples of permissive licenses are CC-00-SA and CC-BY of the Creative Commons."
helmholtz-munich.md,→ CC-0:
helmholtz-munich.md,→ CC-BY:
helmholtz-munich.md,### 7.2 Legal Status of Research Data
helmholtz-munich.md,"Ownership of data does not exist in Germany. However, copyright guarantees everyone the protection of their intellectual creations. Whether research data is subject to the protection of copyright law depends on whether the requirements for the level of intellectual creation or the requirements of database law are met. Both requirements are not regularly met for research data colelcted in routine measurements. Depending on the type of collection, research data can have a level of intellectual creativity that is worthy of protection. In order to ensure legal certainty, it should always be assumed that it is worthy of protection, that is rights of use and exploitation are usually to be clarified contractually with external partners. Careful licensing of published data must also be ensured."
helmholtz-munich.md,"Regardless of the right to the data obtained, the question of the right of exploitation must be seen. The researcher or the research institution can assert a (temporary limited) right of first use of the data obtained as part of their research activities in the form of publications or patents."

humboldt-universität-zu-berlin.md,# HUMBOLDT-UNIVERSITAT ZU BERLIN
humboldt-universität-zu-berlin.md,## Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin Research Data Management Policy
humboldt-universität-zu-berlin.md,### Preamble
humboldt-universität-zu-berlin.md,"Handling of research data responsibly is critical for confirming research results, for the advancement of science and for the dissemination of knowledge. This policy is addressed to all researchers at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin both in their role as independent researchers, and as teachers and supervisors. Their obligation includes instructing students and doctoral candidates about handling of research data properly, as well as imparting subject-specific skills and standards."
humboldt-universität-zu-berlin.md,### What is research data?
humboldt-universität-zu-berlin.md,"Research data means all data that was created in the course of research or results from it. Since the generation or collection of research data depends on a variety of research questions and methods, followed by processing, analysis and publishing and/or archiving, the data may involve a range of media, aggregation levels and formats. Sharing and reusing research data requires documentation about the original context and about tools that were used."
humboldt-universität-zu-berlin.md,## Policy
humboldt-universität-zu-berlin.md,"To further the Proposals for Safeguarding Good Scientific Practice of the German Research Foundation, and the Rules of the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin for Safeguarding Good Scientific Practice and Investigating Allegations of Scholarly Misconduct (Satzung der Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin zur Sicherung guter wissenschaftlicher Praxis und zum Umgang mit Vorwürfen wissenschaftlichen Fehlverhaltens, in German) the University adopts following policy:"
humboldt-universität-zu-berlin.md,"1. HU researchers are committed to the secure storage, processing, documentation and preservation of their research data for the long term. Responsibility for ensuring these processes lies with HU staff in charge of research projects or programmes."
humboldt-universität-zu-berlin.md,2. All HU researchers are encouraged to process research data resulting from their research activities according to the conventions and standards of their respective scientific community. They should document the complete research lifecycle including tools and procedures that they used.
humboldt-universität-zu-berlin.md,"3. HU researchers should take responsibility for deciding at what time and on what legal terms research data may be accessed. The Open Access Declaration of the HU (Open-Access-Erklärung der Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, in German) recommends making research data as well as scholarly publications publicly available in a timely manner. Protection of personal data, copyrights and the legitimate interests of third parties must also be ensured."
humboldt-universität-zu-berlin.md,4. Research data underlying scholarly publications should be archived for the long-term and/or published in an appropriate trustworthy data archive or repository. They count as scholarly research output at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin.
humboldt-universität-zu-berlin.md,Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin has commited itself to establishing the means to enable this policy to be fulfilled.
humboldt-universität-zu-berlin.md,This research data management policy was approved by the Academic Senate on 8th of July 2014.

huron-university-usa-in-london.md,# RESEARCH DATA MANAGEMENT STRATEGY MARCH 2023
huron-university-usa-in-london.md,## I.    Introduction
huron-university-usa-in-london.md,"In March 2021, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) launched the Tri-Agency Research Data Management Policy. This policy seeks to support Canadian research excellence by promoting sound data management and data stewardship practices to ensure “that research makes good use of public funds, experiments and studies are replicable, and research data are available for reuse where ethical, legal, and commercial obligations allow.”1 The agencies recognize that standards for Research Data Management (RDM) vary across disciplines, areas of research, and modes of scientific and scholarly inquiry."
huron-university-usa-in-london.md,"The RDM Policy requires all postsecondary institutions and hospitals eligible to administer Tri-Agency funds to develop an institutional research data management (RDM) strategy that reflects the institution’s size, research intensity, and existing RDM capacity. Additionally, the Tri-Agency RDM Policy, establishes new data management requirements for researchers applying for federal funding. For  certain funding competitions, the agencies will require data management plans (DMPs) to be submitted during the application process. The quality of these plans will be considered in the merit review process. Further, after reviewing the institutional strategies and in step with the readiness of the Canadian research community, the agencies will phase in a data deposit requirement. The RDM policy acknowledges that “determining what counts as research data, and which data should be preserved, is often highly contextual and should be guided by disciplinary norms.”2"
huron-university-usa-in-london.md,## II.   Importance of Research Data Management
huron-university-usa-in-london.md,"RDM enables researchers to organize, store, access, reuse and build upon digital research data. RDM is essential to Canadian researchers’ capacity to securely preserve and use their research data throughout their research projects, reuse their data over the course of their careers and, when appropriate, share their data. Furthermore, as an acknowledged component of research excellence, strong RDM practices support researchers in achieving scientific rigor and enable collaboration in their fields (Tri-Agency Research Data Management Policy - Frequently Asked Questions)."
huron-university-usa-in-london.md,## III.   Institutional Context
huron-university-usa-in-london.md,"Huron University College’s RDM strategy reflects its current research activities, intensity, and context as a small undergraduate liberal arts university, affiliated with a large research-intensive university. Research and research-learning are vital to the culture and mission of Huron University. Huron is committed to research excellence and recognizes that strong research data management is a key component of research excellence."
huron-university-usa-in-london.md,Data management planning and the new Tri-Agency requirements represent a significant change for Huron researchers and for the institution. We are in the early stages of creating the supports and awareness necessary to foster a culture of research data management. Huron recognizes data as an important research output and is committed to promoting responsible RDM that will enable our researchers to establish and implement RDM practices most appropriate to their disciplinary context.
huron-university-usa-in-london.md,"Huron will support researchers in adopting the FAIR Principles to make research data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. The FAIR principles are complemented by Tri-Agency Framework: Responsible Conduct of Research and the TCPS 2 (2022), which provides guidance on data management in areas of consent, privacy and confidentiality, and secondary use of data."
huron-university-usa-in-london.md,## IV.   Indigenous Data Considerations
huron-university-usa-in-london.md,"Huron is committed to decolonizing our curriculum, practices, and relationships with the Indigenous peoples of Canada and particularly of southwestern Ontario. This includes research conducted in partnership with First Nations, Métis and Inuit communities, collectives, and organizations. Huron recognizes that Indigenous communities themselves must “guide and ultimately determine how the data are collected, used and preserved, and have the right to repatriate the data.”3 Huron is committed to working in partnership with Indigenous stakeholders to implement a distinctions-based approach to ensure that the unique rights, interests, and circumstances of First Nations, Métis, and Inuit peoples are acknowledged, affirmed, and implemented"
huron-university-usa-in-london.md,"Huron supports the use of data management practices, such as the First Nations Principles of OCAP® (Ownership, Control, Access, Possession), and the CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance (Collective benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, Ethics), to support Indigenous data sovereignty. In addition, Chapter 9 of the TCPS 2 (2022) details considerations in research with Indigenous Peoples. Huron’s Indigenous Initiatives Coordinator is a key resource in ensuring appropriate and meaningful application of RDM principles and strategies to Indigenous data."
huron-university-usa-in-london.md,## V.   Ethics Considerations
huron-university-usa-in-london.md,Research projects involving human participants are reviewed by Huron’s Research Ethics Board. The REB has recently incorporated research data management in the application form for ethics approval.
huron-university-usa-in-london.md,# VI.  Scope
huron-university-usa-in-london.md,"This strategy applies to all faculty, staff, and students who conduct research at Huron. It also applies to any person (including, but not limited to, affiliated faculty, visiting professors or students, adjunct professors and postdoctoral associates and fellows) appointed or invited to engage in research activity at, or under the auspices of, Huron.4"
huron-university-usa-in-london.md,## VII.  Oversight and Review
huron-university-usa-in-london.md,"The Office of the Provost, with support from the Coordinator, Research & Learning, is responsible for the development and implementation of the RDM strategy. As a living document, the RDM strategy will be revised on an ongoing basis in consultation with Huron researchers, Library and Learning Services, Information Technology Services, the Research Ethics Board, and other institutional stakeholders."
huron-university-usa-in-london.md,# VIII.   Institutional Strategy
huron-university-usa-in-london.md,"Huron wishes to foster a research data management culture where researchers are aware of data management planning tools, repositories, and resources and incorporate them throughout the research lifecycle. Our initial priorities are to increase awareness, support, and capacity for RDM practices, while leveraging, where appropriate, RDM resources available through Western University, the Digital Research Alliance of Canada (formerly Portage) and other organizations."

huron-university-usa-in-london.md,### Research Data
huron-university-usa-in-london.md,"Research data are data that are used as primary sources to support technical or scientific enquiry, research, scholarship, or creative practice, and that are used as evidence in the research process and/or are commonly accepted in the research community as necessary to validate research findings and results. Research data may be experimental data, observational data, operational data, third party data, public sector data, monitoring data, processed data, or repurposed data. What is considered relevant research data is often highly contextual and determining what counts as such should be guided by disciplinary norms (Tri-Agency Research Data Management Policy - Frequently Asked Questions)."
huron-university-usa-in-london.md,### Research Data Management
huron-university-usa-in-london.md,"Research data management (RDM) refers to the processes applied through the lifecycle of a research project to guide the collection, documentation, storage, sharing and preservation of research data. RDM is essential throughout the data lifecycle—from data creation, processing, analysis, preservation, storage and access, to sharing and reuse (where appropriate), at which point the cycle begins again. Data management should be practiced over the entire lifecycle of the data, including planning the investigation, conducting the research, backing up data as it is created and used, disseminating data, and preserving data for the long term after the research investigation has concluded (Tri-Agency Research Data Management Policy - Frequently Asked Questions)."
huron-university-usa-in-london.md,### Data Management Plan
huron-university-usa-in-london.md,"A “data management plan” (DMP) is “a living document, typically associated with an individual research project or program that consists of the practices, processes and strategies that pertain to a set of specified topics related to data management and curation. DMPs should be modified throughout the course of a research project to reflect changes in project design, methods, or other considerations. DMPs guide researchers in articulating their plans for managing data; they do not necessarily compel researchers to manage data differently” (Tri-Agency Research Data Management Policy, Frequently Asked Questions, Government of Canada 2021)."
huron-university-usa-in-london.md,### Data Deposit
huron-university-usa-in-london.md,"“Data deposit” refers to when the research data collected as part of a research project are transferred to a research data repository. The repository should have easily accessible policies describing deposit and user licenses, access control, preservation procedures, storage and backup practices, and sustainability and succession plans. The deposit of research data into appropriate repositories supports ongoing data-retention and, where appropriate, access to the data. (Tri-Agency Research Data Management Policy, Frequently Asked Questions, Government of Canada 2021)."

international-institute-for-geo---information-science-and-earth-observation.md,"Planning data management is essential for every research project and should be an integral part of good research design. Quality research starts with a good DMP. Therefore, for every research project conducted within ITC, a DMP must be written and regularly updated during the project."
international-institute-for-geo---information-science-and-earth-observation.md,"Master students must write a DMP for their research and include it in the documents required for the proposal. The DMP has to be reviewed by the supervisors as part of the proposal’s assessment. PhD candidates must follow a Data Management Bootcamp (1 ECTS) offered by UT to learn how to write a DMP for their PhD projects. The DMP must be written within the first year of their PhD trajectory, reviewed by the Faculty Data Steward, and included in the documents required for the PhD Qualifier. The DMP for a PhD project must be reviewed annually by the supervisors during the annual interview and updated where necessary. Any other research project must have a DMP before the start of the said project, but no later than four months after the start of the research, and it must be reviewed by the Faculty Data Steward. The DMP has to be reviewed regularly and updated where necessary and it must be adhered to by all research team members."
international-institute-for-geo---information-science-and-earth-observation.md,"A DMP template is available at UT’s DMP-tool. The template has been accepted by the Dutch Research Council NWO, the independent governmental body Care Research NetherlandsMedical Sciences ZonMW, and the EU (e.g., the European Research Council ERC). Therefore, the UT DMP template should be used unless the funding body or their partners require the use of a different template."

international-institute-for-geo---information-science-and-earth-observation.md,### 5.2 Data Storage
international-institute-for-geo---information-science-and-earth-observation.md,"Effective research data management is essential for maintaining the accessibility and security of research data. This section outlines the best practices and guidelines for storing data during research. In principle, all research data collected and generated should be stored safely and protected against unauthorised access, accidental disclosure, and loss. The choice of storage facility depends on many factors, such as the type of data, size, the need for collaboration with research partners, etc."
international-institute-for-geo---information-science-and-earth-observation.md,"A copy of key research data (key files of the data collected and generated) and the related materials (e.g. documentation, protocols, models, or questionnaires) must be stored in facilities offered by UT, unless exceptions apply."
international-institute-for-geo---information-science-and-earth-observation.md,"In case researchers wish to use their own storage facilities for primary storage, note that UT has strict requirements when it comes to acquisition of research data storage. It is required to ensure that the storage facility is at least ISO 27001-certified and in the case of health data NEN 7510-certified. These two certificates prove that the way data, especially personal and privacy-sensitive data, are stored complies with current security standards. If you need advice regarding the storage certification, please contact the Faculty ICT Account Manager"
international-institute-for-geo---information-science-and-earth-observation.md,"Portable devices (e.g., external hard drives, USB sticks, or personal laptops) should not be used as the primary storage facility of research data."
international-institute-for-geo---information-science-and-earth-observation.md,"Non-digital research data and related materials, such as physical samples, lab notebooks and printed informed consent forms, must be stored in accordance with clearly described procedures and standards within the research group and/or project and must be digitised where possible."
international-institute-for-geo---information-science-and-earth-observation.md,Take a look at the UT storage decision tree which provides an up-to-date overview of UT storage facilities and all other secure storage solutions offered by UT.
international-institute-for-geo---information-science-and-earth-observation.md,Contact the Faculty Data Steward in case you have questions or need support.
international-institute-for-geo---information-science-and-earth-observation.md,### 5.3 Data Sharing and Transfer
international-institute-for-geo---information-science-and-earth-observation.md,"Data sharing refers to providing access to data in a way that maintains the data's availability, accessibility, and confidentiality. This section outlines the best practices and guidelines for data sharing with colleagues within or outside ITC during research."
international-institute-for-geo---information-science-and-earth-observation.md,"Stored research data should be accessible to at least one other member of the research team other than the main researcher, ideally the principal researcher or a daily supervisor for Postdocs, PhDs, and Master students. Access to the stored data by other research team members is vital to ensure data availability. For collaborative projects involving data sharing, a data sharing agreement, which establishes the terms and conditions under which data are shared and clarifies the roles and responsibilities of both parties regarding the management of the data, should be drawn up in consultation with the Faculty Privacy Contact Person and should be signed by the Faculty Dean prior to sharing research data with external parties."
international-institute-for-geo---information-science-and-earth-observation.md,The UT storage decision tree also offers a range of facilities for data transfer and data
international-institute-for-geo---information-science-and-earth-observation.md,sharing.
international-institute-for-geo---information-science-and-earth-observation.md,"There are several types of data sharing agreements, depending on the research project and type of data:"
international-institute-for-geo---information-science-and-earth-observation.md,o A data transfer agreement is generally used when sharing non-personal data with third parties;
international-institute-for-geo---information-science-and-earth-observation.md,"o A joint controllership agreement is used to establish shared responsibilities regarding the processing of personal data with collaborators. Consortium agreements and Grant Agreements (e.g., Horizon 2020) provide a legal basis for this type of agreement;"
international-institute-for-geo---information-science-and-earth-observation.md,"o A data processing agreement is used when a third party is involved in the processing of personal data on behalf of the data controller (such as collecting, storing, or analysing the data on your behalf);"
international-institute-for-geo---information-science-and-earth-observation.md,"o A non-disclosure agreement is typically used for trade or commercial data, including trade secrets and patent-related data."
international-institute-for-geo---information-science-and-earth-observation.md,### 5.4 Data Documentation
international-institute-for-geo---information-science-and-earth-observation.md,"Data documentation is crucial to ensure that research data are understandable and re-usable by yourself or by others. In accordance with the FAIR principles,  as a minimum requirement a definite version of research data should be well documented. However, best practice is to start documenting data and record metadata early during the research process and to update these regularly throughout research in order to warrant completeness and accuracy."
international-institute-for-geo---information-science-and-earth-observation.md,"Research data, both digital and non-digital, should always be accompanied by metadata to ensure findability and re-usability. Research data must be accompanied by additional documentation (e.g., in the form of a README file, data paper, etc.) to enable correct interpretation and re-use. Clear, concise language and standard terminologies should be used to ensure comprehensibility."
international-institute-for-geo---information-science-and-earth-observation.md,"Research data must be accompanied by at least one set of metadata for the entire dataset. However, for comprehensive documentation, metadata should be provided for each distinct type of data or file where applicable or necessary."
international-institute-for-geo---information-science-and-earth-observation.md,"Since the data repositories provide machine-readable forms of metadata, most often based on a generic metadata standard such as Dublin Core, it is recommended to provide additional documentation in the form of a README file. This documentation should encompass, but not be limited to the data contents and structure, along with all relevant methodological information (e.g., the collection, processing, and quality control aspects of said data), records of different versions of the data files, and details on sharing and access."
international-institute-for-geo---information-science-and-earth-observation.md,"Discipline-specific metadata standards (e.g., the ISO 19115 geographic information metadata standard) can be used to decide on additional information aimed at enhancing the data documentation."
international-institute-for-geo---information-science-and-earth-observation.md,"For the local management of your research datasets and related metadata and for publishing them easily to different research data repositories, you can use the fairly toolset. This toolset includes a command line tool and a JupyterLab extension that facilitate creating, uploading, and downloading research datasets together with metadata without requiring programming skills."
international-institute-for-geo---information-science-and-earth-observation.md,### 5.5 Data Preservation
international-institute-for-geo---information-science-and-earth-observation.md,Data preservation refers to the long-time storage of research data to enable the verification and reproduction of research and the re-use of data. Publishing and archiving data are the two most practical ways to preserve data after research.
international-institute-for-geo---information-science-and-earth-observation.md,"Digital research data needed for verification and reproduction (at least those underlying all types of academic publications, such as journal articles, reports, theses, etc.) have to be preserved in one of ITC’s approved data repositories or archive facilities for at least ten years after completion of the project (in accordance with The Netherlands Code of Conduct for Academic Practice)."
international-institute-for-geo---information-science-and-earth-observation.md,"Preserved in a repository, research data can be published publicly, with restricted access, or embargoed. In accordance with the ITC’s Open Science Strategic Plan, the data should be published as open as possible and as closed as necessary, i.e., in case of legitimate reasons, such as ethical reasons, reasons concerning privacy protection and national security reasons, knowledge safety and export control, confidentiality, commercial interest, legal and contractual obligations reasons. However, the metadata must always be made available publicly."
international-institute-for-geo---information-science-and-earth-observation.md,"Digital research data that cannot be shared with third parties, including trusted data repositories, must be archived in UT’s archive facility."
international-institute-for-geo---information-science-and-earth-observation.md,"Research data underlying master's and PhD research projects must be preserved before graduation. Research data underlying other types of research projects must be preserved no later than one month after completion of the research project. Non-digital research data, wherever possible and appropriate, should be digitised. If the data is to be preserved in non-digital format, they should be stored securely in accordance with the respective department’s common practices."
international-institute-for-geo---information-science-and-earth-observation.md,"The primary author and co-authors of academic publications share the responsibility of controlling access and making any decision with respect to the data and, therefore, should all be acknowledged in the metadata of the archived or published datasets as contact persons."
international-institute-for-geo---information-science-and-earth-observation.md,"For research projects run by ITC researchers, access to the data with restricted access is controlled by the principal investigator. In situations where the original researchers are not available or no longer affiliated with ITC, access to the data is determined and granted by the department chair."
international-institute-for-geo---information-science-and-earth-observation.md,"Archived or published digital and non-digital research data require sufficient documentation to enable proper interpretation and re-use, as described in the section on Data Documentation."
international-institute-for-geo---information-science-and-earth-observation.md,"For publishing research data, UT and ITC recommend two trusted research data repositories: DANS and 4TU.ResearchData."
international-institute-for-geo---information-science-and-earth-observation.md,"Trusted repositories are the repositories that have received a Core Trust Seal Certification, which warrants the reliability and durability of data repositories and, hence, the potential for storing data over a long period of time."
international-institute-for-geo---information-science-and-earth-observation.md,"For archiving research data, UT has a certified facility for long-term research data archiving known as AREDA. It is required to contact the Faculty Data Steward before archiving data in AREDA."
international-institute-for-geo---information-science-and-earth-observation.md,"For archiving research data from master research projects, ITC has a separate archive facility."
international-institute-for-geo---information-science-and-earth-observation.md,### 5.6 Data Registration in PURE
international-institute-for-geo---information-science-and-earth-observation.md,"The registration of research output in Pure, including research data, is essential for consolidating information from various sources at one single platform in order to offer a comprehensive overview of ITC research activities and their impact."
international-institute-for-geo---information-science-and-earth-observation.md,"All archived or published digital and non-digital data must be registered in Pure (UT Research Information), where their metadata information is recorded to increase visibility."
international-institute-for-geo---information-science-and-earth-observation.md,"Step-by-step guidelines, including a Demo and more guidance on registering research output, are available on the UT Research Information Website"
international-institute-for-geo---information-science-and-earth-observation.md,"### 5.7 Personal, Confidential, and Classified Research Data Management"
international-institute-for-geo---information-science-and-earth-observation.md,"Warranting the protection of confidential data, privacy, and the rights of research subjects is paramount in all research activities conducted within ITC. This section outlines key principles, ctices, and compliance measures related to the handling of personal and confidential data in research:"
international-institute-for-geo---information-science-and-earth-observation.md,All research activities involving personal data must adhere to the principles and requirements outlined in the GDPR;
international-institute-for-geo---information-science-and-earth-observation.md,Researchers should only collect the minimum amount of personal data necessary for research purposes. Collecting unnecessary or excessive personal data should be avoided; Researchers and students must report any processing of personal data through GDPR registration using the online UT DMP+GDPR tool;
international-institute-for-geo---information-science-and-earth-observation.md,"A Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA), i.e, risk assessment, should be carried out prior to processing any personal data likely to result in high risks to the rights and freedom of data subjects;"
international-institute-for-geo---information-science-and-earth-observation.md,"Personal data, confidential and classified data must be protected against unauthorised access and loss as much as possible. More particularly, personal data should be stored in a GDPR-compliant data storage facility and, where needed, additional security measures such as encryption should be applied;"
international-institute-for-geo---information-science-and-earth-observation.md,"Personal data should be anonymised or pseudonymised as soon as possible, preferably immediately after collecting those data. Similarly, secondary datasets containing personal data should be pseudonymised or anonymised immediately after receiving them. Note that unlike anonymised data, pseudonymised data are still personal data;"
international-institute-for-geo---information-science-and-earth-observation.md,"Prior to sharing research data containing personal data, a data processing agreement should be drawn up in consultation with the Faculty Privacy Contact Person and should be signed by the Faculty Dean. A non-disclosure agreement is required in the case of sharing confidential and classified data; see more details under the “Data Sharing and Transferring” section in this policy;"
international-institute-for-geo---information-science-and-earth-observation.md,"Personal data needed for verification and reproduction (at least those underlying all types of academic publications, such as journal articles, reports, theses, etc.) have to be preserved in one of ITC’s approved data repositories or archive facilities for at least ten years after completion of the project (in accordance with The Netherlands Code of Conduct for Academic Practice);"
international-institute-for-geo---information-science-and-earth-observation.md,"Informed consent forms used to collect personal data, either in digital or non-digital form, have to be archived for at least ten years after completion of the research project; Researchers must report any data breaches immediately. Examples of potential data breach include devices containing personal, confidential and classified data being lost or stolen, sharing these data with the unauthorised persons, etc. For more information on data breach, see Cyber Safety at UT;"
international-institute-for-geo---information-science-and-earth-observation.md,"Research involving human subjects or potentially sensitive data about or from individuals, groups or organisations must be reviewed by the ITC Ethics Committee before the work commences. For other types of research, it is strongly recommended to identify potential ethical issues related to, for instance, the environment, dual-use aspects, low-income countries, or artificial intelligence, through an ethics review."
international-institute-for-geo---information-science-and-earth-observation.md,"More information on the appropriate use of personal data in research, including a flowchart and practical guidance, can be found on the UT Cyber Safety Website."
international-institute-for-geo---information-science-and-earth-observation.md,This  pre-DPIA assessment form should be used to find out whether a full DPIA is required.
international-institute-for-geo---information-science-and-earth-observation.md,"UT network storage facilities (e.g., P-drive, Unishare,) are ISO 27001-certified, NEN 7510-certified and GDPR-compliant; therefore, they guarantee maximum security for storing and sharing personal data, confidential and classified data during research."
international-institute-for-geo---information-science-and-earth-observation.md,"For personal data stored in non-UT cloud storage (e.g., MS Teams, OneDrive, etc.) or on portable devices (e.g., USB sticks, external hard drives, tablets, etc.), encryption is required."
international-institute-for-geo---information-science-and-earth-observation.md,"Personal data stored on portable devices must be deleted as soon as possible and no later than at the end of the part of research for which the data are needed (e.g., after fieldwork)."
international-institute-for-geo---information-science-and-earth-observation.md,"The encryption key must be kept safe and stored in a separate location. Furthermore, it should be shared with at least one other employee in the research group. Generally, this person will be the principal researcher or the chair of the research group."
international-institute-for-geo---information-science-and-earth-observation.md,"Non-digital informed consent forms should be digitised where possible. However, UT has an archive service for non-digital informed consent forms. Please contact the Faculty Data Steward for support."
international-institute-for-geo---information-science-and-earth-observation.md,"To submit your application for ethics review, visit the ITC Ethics Committee website or contact the Faculty’s Research Support Officer."

johannes-kepler-university-linz.md,### 4. Rights of use
johannes-kepler-university-linz.md,#### 4.1 General information
johannes-kepler-university-linz.md,"The JKU is entitled to the rights of use of copyrighted works created by people at the university in the course of their university activities, based on the corresponding employment contract regulations. In all other respects, the provisions of article 106 in Austrian university law and Austrian copyright law in their respective valid versions shall apply."
johannes-kepler-university-linz.md,"In accordance with section 106(1) sentence 1 of Austrian university law, scientific members of staff at the university shall be entitled to publish their own academic research work and results; this shall also apply to doctors during medical specialist training in accordance with section 96 of Austrian university law as well as to academic staff working on externally funded projects (project staff).9"
johannes-kepler-university-linz.md,"In addition, in accordance with section 106(1) sentence 2 in conjunction with sections 11 and 20 of Austrian copyright law, academic members of staff at the university who have made their own academic contribution to a research project shall have the right to be named as co-authors. Scientific members of staff who independently create copy-righted works are therefore entitled to be named as the sole author.10 If a computer program or a database (section 40f paragraph 3 Austrian copyright law) is created by an employee in fulfilment of tasks for which they are employed, the right to copyright designation according to section 40b Austrian copyright law - unless agreed otherwise - belongs to the employer.11"
johannes-kepler-university-linz.md,"In the case of an employee invention in accordance with section 7 paragraph 3 of Austrian patent law, the rectorate must be informed of the invention and the JKU has a right of access to it in accordance with section 106 paragraph 3 Austrian university law. In accordance with section 8 paragraph 1 Austrian patent law, the researcher is entitled to special remuneration for transferring their invention to the employer and for granting right of use with regard to such an invention (cf. SOP 8209). According to Section 20 paragraph 1 Austrian patent law, the inventor is entitled to be named as the inventor."
johannes-kepler-university-linz.md,#### 4.2  Special provisions relating to the Faculty of Medicine
johannes-kepler-university-linz.md,"In the case of employee inventions made by employees of the JKU or Kepler Universitätsklinikum GmbH (KUK) and the JKU, the cooperation agreement between the JKU and KUK stipulates in sections 23.1. and 28.1. that both KUK and the JKU will ensure that inventions made by their employees in the course of their work for the clinical department of the medical faculty are directly or indirectly adopted and, depending on cost bearing capacity, can be utilised for the benefit of KUK or the JKU. The costs of the special remuneration for the invention to be paid by the employer in accordance with Austrian patent law are borne by the contracting parties in proportion to the exploitation revenues they earn."
johannes-kepler-university-linz.md,### 5. Principles of research data management
johannes-kepler-university-linz.md,Research data are stored and made available in a suitable repository or archiving system and are referenced using persistent identifiers.
johannes-kepler-university-linz.md,"When depositing data in a repository, researchers are required to declare their affiliation to the JKU in accordance with the provisions of the ""Guideline for the declaration of affiliation for publications and research projects""12. In order to maintain the integrity of research data, it must be stored correctly, completely, unaltered and reliably, and must be findable, accessible, traceable, interoperable and, where possible, made available for re-use in accordance with FAIR principles. To enable the re-use of research data or research results by citing the original sources, the currently valid citation rules must be applied.  The storage must be dated, and subsequent changes must be stored as separately as possible from the original data. When dealing with clinical research data, it is recommended that the ALCOA+ principle of good clinical practice be applied."
johannes-kepler-university-linz.md,"Whenever personal data is handled, it must be in compliance with the applicable data protection regulations. When handling health data, the increased data protection requirements must be met. According to article 2 paragraph 1 of the GDPR in conjunction with article 4 paragraph 1 of Austrian privacy law, the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation and the Austrian privacy law apply to the fully and partially automated processing of personal data. If data are not processed automatically, but manually instead, the GDPR only applies if the data are stored or are to be stored in a structured file system that is organised according to specific criteria, so that access to the personal data it contains is not only possible by sequentially going through the entire collection, but there is a simplified method of indexing and locating its contents.13 Files and collections of files and their cover sheets which are not arranged according to specific criteria - and are therefore unstructured - are not covered by the GDPR; paper files, for example, such as court files in particular, are not covered.14 Also excluded are data obtained purely orally, acoustically or visually, provided they are not to be stored.15"
johannes-kepler-university-linz.md,"In the absence of any particular creative achievement (since the implementation and display of results is usually the task of a computer program) - individual data, raw data or results of the mere evaluation or analysis results are in principle not works in accordance with section 1 paragraph 1 of Austrian copyright law and are therefore not protected by copyright, so there is also no provision for licensing.16"
johannes-kepler-university-linz.md,"However, data collections may constitute databases protected by copyright in accordance with section 40f paragraph 1 of Austrian copyright law (database works). But, if the collection of data does not achieve the necessary level of creativity (simple database), it is not protected as a collective work (section 6 Austrian copyright law); in this case ancillary copyright in accordance with section 76c onwards of Austrian copyright law applies if a substantial investment was required for the procurement, verification and presentation of the contents of the database.17 Whether or what kind of protectability applies to research data requires verification in each individual case by the department responsible for data clearing."
johannes-kepler-university-linz.md,"Provided that there are no third-party rights, legal obligations, ethical aspects or property regulations to the contrary, research data should be freely licensed and made openly available for re-use, while respecting intellectual property rights."
johannes-kepler-university-linz.md,"In accordance with section 2f paragraph 3 of Austrian research organisation law, the minimum archiving period for research data is 10 years from publication of the research results or completion of the research activity. The administrative documents accompanying the research activities must also be archived. If research data and records are to be (or have to be) erased or destroyed, this may only be performed using a standardised process, taking into account all legal regulations, especially internal university regulations and ethical aspects. Principal investigators or their legal successors must be informed and offered the opportunity for the research data to be handed over. All measures taken must be documented and be accessible for possible later assessment."

justus-liebig-university-giessen.md,"Research data are the foundaƟon and the result of scienƟfic work. The responsible handling of research data ensures replicability, verifiability and reusability of research results and is thus a fundamental aspect of good scienƟfic pracƟce. Justus Liebig University acknowledges the importance of sustainable research data management and regulates the handling of research data for all members of the university in the following principles, irrespecƟve of data protecƟon requirements and the guidelines for ensuring good scienƟfic pracƟce."
justus-liebig-university-giessen.md,"1. Research data refers to all data that are gained in the process of doing research through observaƟon, collecƟon, measurement, experiment, simulaƟon and processing or that are the result thereof. This also includes the documentaƟon and soŌware necessary for the understanding of such data. Depending on scienƟfic discipline and faculty culture, research data can exist in different types, aggregaƟon levels and formats."
justus-liebig-university-giessen.md,"2. Research data management includes all handling of research data, ranging from planning the data collecƟon and storage to assuring data quality and processing data to making data available or publishing it. Research data management is oriented towards the current professional standards and takes discipline-specific requirements into account. Handling research data will be documented in a research data management plan at an early stage of a research project and, if necessary, is to be adjusted to the process of the respecƟve project."
justus-liebig-university-giessen.md,"3. According to research data management, researchers are required to secure research data safely, appropriately process and document research data, and store research data in the long-term (at least for 10 years). The protecƟon of personal data as well as compliance to copyright and legiƟmate interest of third parƟes must be ensured. The principal invesƟgators of research projects are responsible for guaranteeing these processes."
justus-liebig-university-giessen.md,4. Justus Liebig University recommends you give access to your research data as early as possible using relevant disciplinary or interdisciplinary repositories according to the principles of Open Access. The point in Ɵme and the condiƟons of giving access to research data fall under the responsibility of the researchers.
justus-liebig-university-giessen.md,1 Please note that only the German version of the regulaƟons is official and legally binding. The English version is for informaƟve purposes only.

karlstad-university.md,# Guidelines for Research Data Management at Karlstad University
karlstad-university.md,## 1. Introduction
karlstad-university.md,"Karlstad University is responsible for ensuring that all research data are reliable and managed in a legal, appropriate and secure manner in conformity with standard research practice. The university advocates the implementation of a clear structure in how data, material and documents are organised through the research process, in order to avoid time-consuming work in connection with archiving, sharing and reusing the vast amount of data generated by research."
karlstad-university.md,"Karlstad University takes active measures to ensure that research data and related meta data are findable, accessible and re-usable for further research purposes in accordance with the recommendations of the EU commission1 and the Swedish government.23"
karlstad-university.md,## 2. Definitions
karlstad-university.md,"According to the ethics review act,4 research refers to ”scientific experimental or theoretical work designed to obtain new knowledge and research-based development projects, excluding projects carried out as part of undergraduate or master level studies”."
karlstad-university.md,"The term principal research institution  refers, according to the ethics review act, to ”a public authority or physical or legal body in whose organisation the research is carried out.”"
karlstad-university.md,"According to the National Archives’ general directives on deletion of research-related documents in public authorities,5 a research project is defined as ”a research activity delimited in time and purpose related to a certain assignment and/or certain persons.” A research project can comprise several sub projects and can be externally or internally funded."
karlstad-university.md,"In terms of these guidelines, research data can refer to all forms of stored data collected or created to be analysed for research purposes and on which results and conclusions generated through the research are based. Some examples of research data are statistics and measuring data, transcribed interviews and questionnaire answers, results of experiments, field study observations, audio-video recorded interviews and visual images/art."
karlstad-university.md,"The term meta data refers in these guidelines to a structured description of research data, i.e. “data about data”. Meta data can consist of a descriptive or contextual information on the provenance of data, such as how variables are defined, how data are structured, how various data sets are related, information on  how and by whom the data were collected or if a special software was used to read or analyse the data."
karlstad-university.md,"The term data citation refers, in these guidelines, to the practice of referring to research data in the same way that researchers provide references to journal articles, reports, conference contribution and other publications."
karlstad-university.md,## 3. Foundational principles for research data management
karlstad-university.md,"Karlstad University is the principal research institution for the research carried out by staff or affiliated staff at the university. Research data collected by researchers or doctoral students belong as a rule to Karlstad University. This means that the university has ownership6 to research data, and also responsibility for managing research data in a legal, appropriate and secure manner."
karlstad-university.md,An important principle regarding research data is that it shall be preserved and accessible so that primary material and data analysed can be used without problem to support and verify the methods and results of the research.
karlstad-university.md,"All research projects at Karlstad University shall undergo ethical review and be registered in the university registry, according to the review process decided by the vice-chancellor."
karlstad-university.md,### 3.1 Public documents
karlstad-university.md,Karlstad University is a public authority under the government. This means that research data management must comply with the basic principles applying to all public authorities’ handling of public documents.
karlstad-university.md,Research data collected outside of Karlstad University become public documents when submitted to the university. Research data created at the university as a rule are to be seen as drawn up public documents when the data are finalised in the research process.7
karlstad-university.md,Research data shall be stored in an easily accessible way as long as they are deemed valuable for  further research and also be prepared for long-term storage and archiving in accordance with the regulations of the National Archives and the university’s guidelines.  Research data can only be disposed of if there is a rule allowing it. Disposal must follow the local rules on procedures at Karlstad University.
karlstad-university.md,### 3.2 The principle of public access to information
karlstad-university.md,"The principle of public access means that the public and the media have the right to insight into governmental authorities’ operations.  In principle, this means that Swedish as well as foreign citizens have the right to request reading the documents held by Swedish authorities. Generally speaking, this also applies to research data collected or created at Karlstad University."
karlstad-university.md,"The right to request documents is, however, restricted in two ways. First, not all documents held by an authority are public documents; second,  certain information in public documents can be confidential (secrecy marked).  Before research data are provided under the public access principle, a secrecy assessment must be made in each individual case."
karlstad-university.md,### 3.3 Data protection management and ethical review
karlstad-university.md,"The General Data Protection Regulation8 (GDPR), in brief, means that personal data may only be collected for certain justified reasons, that no more data than necessary may be treated, that data may not be stored for longer than necessary, and that treatment should be justified and reasonable in relation to the individual’s basic rights and freedoms. It is also important to ensure that personal data are handled in a secure way and that no more people than those authorised have access to the data."
karlstad-university.md,"If  sensitive personal data (article 9 GDPR) or information of criminal offences (article 10 GDPR) are treated for research purposes, also the rules stipulated in legislation pertaining to ethical review of research on humans must be considered. When these types of personal data are treated, the approval of the Ethical Review Authority is always required. Applicants are first  to be submitted to the local ethics board at Karlstad University."
karlstad-university.md,### 3.4 Information security
karlstad-university.md,"Information security involves protecting information against various forms of threat by adapting the technical, physical and administrative environments in which the information is handled. With regard to the delicacy of information and the risks involved in the handling, Karlstad University has a general responsibility for implementing appropriate technical and organisational protective measures to ensure and be able to demonstrate that the information is handled appropriately and in compliance with current legislation."
karlstad-university.md,"Research data must therefore be handled to ensure that information is protected against unauthorised access (confidentiality), erroneous changes (accuracy), and that the information is accessible when needed  (accessibility). It is also important to make sure that the information cannot be changed, requested by or provided to any unauthorised persons (traceability)."
karlstad-university.md,"The two most important measures for achieving appropriate information security for research data is either to classification of information to be treated (i.e. completely insignificant information, sensitive information,  personal data, sensitive personal data or confidential information), or to use the IT resources available for the purpose at Karlstad University. As a rule, research data shall only be handled in the IT systems and cloud services provided by Karlstad University with the appropriate and adapted technical and organisational protection measures."
karlstad-university.md,### 3.5 Research projects with several principal research institutions
karlstad-university.md,"Karlstad University is principal research institution and responsible for research data generated by various researchers and research groups at the university.   However, the situation is more complex when it comes to collaboration projects with four principal research institutions. For such projects, agreements regulating the collaboration should as a rule be drawn up, including how research data will be handled in the project.  How to handle research data can also be documented by drawing up a data management plan for the project."
karlstad-university.md,"Research data collected and created at Karlstad University normally belong to the university. If  there are plans to move a research project, or parts of it,  to or from Karlstad University, the  possibilities to transfer, copy or borrow research data should be investigated.9 If research data will be transferred from Karlstad University the National archives must be notified. A researcher who moves from Karlstad University needs to investigate the conditions for transferring data in consultation with Karlstad University and the receiving university before the transfer."
karlstad-university.md,### 3.6 Data management plans
karlstad-university.md,"The process of handling research data continues through the whole life cycle of a research project. The process includes collecting, documenting, processing, storing, sharing, archiving and deleting documents.  Proceeding in a structured way and making data accessible will ensure a future reuse of  the material."
karlstad-university.md,"Some funders require a data management plan for the research projects receiving funding. The plan shall describe how the data used in the course of research are collected and/or created will be handled after the project completion. Karlstad University recommends that a plan be drawn up for all projects generating research data, also if not required by the funder."
karlstad-university.md,## 4. Open access to research data
karlstad-university.md,"Open access to research data means that electronic research data and related meta data shall be easily accessible via the internet with as few restrictions as possible. In July 2012, the EU commission recommended the member state to contribute to increased access to research information.  As part of Horizon 2020, further recommendations were issued for open science comprising publications as well as research data. The recommendations were updated in the spring of 2018 and describe how member states should promote sharing research data via national action plans and joint storage solutions, as well as inventive programmes, reward systems and, instruction for researchers.10"
karlstad-university.md,"In its research strategic proposition,  ""Knowledge in collaboration: for societal challenges and reinforced competitiveness"" the Swedish government states that  ”research results, such as research data and research publications generated through publicly funded research should be open and accessible as far as possible.  Certain types of data, however, require restricted access to protect personal integrity, national security, for example.  Openness for research with an innovation potential may need to be restricted for reasons of intellectual property rights.  However, it is an important position that open access is the norm and that restrictions in this regard are exceptions"".11"
karlstad-university.md,"Karlstad University actively works towards promoting open access to research data according to the EU commission's and the government's recommendations.  Research data which are the result of partly or wholly public funding should without charge make data accessible to further research on condition that there is no legal (e.g. secrecy or rules on personal data handling), ethical, technical or commercial reasons. Access to research data shall, at Karlstad University, follow the principle ""as open as possible and as restricted as necessary."""
karlstad-university.md,"Certain types of data, however, may not be made accessible, not even with restrictions. For obvious reasons, it is not, for example, permitted to publish confidential information openly on the internet, which means revealing secrets, which is a crime.  This prohibition also applies to research data containing personal data. There are many occasions on which research data may not be made open and accessible, and an assessment must be made in every individual"
karlstad-university.md,Researchers at Karlstad University are responsible for making research data accessible in an appropriate way. There is no requirement that the data should be made accessible before the researchers have published their results. Karlstad University recommends that researchers as a rule make data accessible in an established data repositorium –– completely open or with restrictions based on assessment of appropriateness ––  with data citation requirements.
karlstad-university.md,## 5. FAIR principles
karlstad-university.md,"The FAIR principles12  (F - Findable, A - Accessible, I - Interoperable, R - Reusable) play an important part in efforts towards open science.  They describe some of the most central guidelines for sound data management and open access to electronic research data.  Research data do not need be in digital form originally, but efficient accessibility and FAIR implementation require data in digital form.  The FAIR principles were published for the first time in 2016 and since then the EU and a number of research funders, universities and research infrastructures have endorsed them. In Sweden,  the Research Council and the Royal Library have the government's mandate to develop criteria for assessing the extent to which research data and scholarly publications meet the FAIR principles.13 Altogether, FAIR comprises 15 principles which can be applied to research in all disciplines."
karlstad-university.md,"Handling digital research data at Karlstad University should follow the international FAIR principles to the extent it is practicable.  Karlstad University strives to make research data with related meta data findable, accessible and reusable for new research purposes long-term, which generally means several generations of the hard and software required for the processing."
karlstad-university.md,"However, it is important to note that the FAIR principles do not entail that digital research data should always be open and accessible to everyone. Research ethical assessments, information provided to research participants, personal data protection legislation, and secrecy are factors that always warrant attention before research data can be made accessible beyond the research group, as described under section 5 above."
karlstad-university.md,## 6. Responsibility for research data management
karlstad-university.md,"Karlstad University is principal research institution for the research carried out at the university. This means that the university is responsible for ensuring that all research data are reliable and managed in a legal, appropriate and secure manner in conformity with standard research practice."
karlstad-university.md,"As head of the authority, the vice-chancellor has the main responsibility to ensure that operations are carried out according to legislation and efficiently. The vice-chancellor decides on all overarching regulatory documents at Karlstad University."
karlstad-university.md,"At faculty level, the dean is responsible for faculty adherence to current legislation and approved regulatory documents regarding research data management. The dean may delegate the responsibility to department heads.  Heads of departments are responsible for ensuring that departmental research data are archived and disposed of in compliance with the law."
karlstad-university.md,"However, researchers always have the main responsibility for their research and must comply with standard research practice, current legislation and procedures.  This also applies to sound and appropriate handling of research data."
karlstad-university.md,"Research projects with several researchers from Karlstad University the main responsible researchers should normally be responsible for the research data management. If the main responsible researchers should leave Karlstad University or for some other reason should be unable to perform the task, the responsibility is transferred to the head of department hosting the research project. until a new project leader has been appointed. If research data are transferred to another part of Karlstad University, so is the responsibility for the data."
karlstad-university.md,## 7. Research data management support
karlstad-university.md,"At Karlstad University there is a research data group for issues relating to research data management, data management plans and open access to research data."
karlstad-university.md,"The research data group's duty is to inform about research data issues at the university and to ensure that concerned target groups are updated and have the opportunity to get instruction regularly.  The research data group also has a supportive and consultative function in terms of advice and recommendations on research data management, data management plans and open access to research data."
karlstad-university.md,The research data group consists of representatives from the central service functions. There is also a reference group with researchers from the faculties. The research data group can be reached at the following address: forskningsdata@kau.se

kth-royal-institute-of-technology.md,## Guidelines on managing research data
kth-royal-institute-of-technology.md,This regulation has been approved by the President (ref. V-2020-0678) and is valid as of 1 January 2021. The policy document regulates research data management in accordance with international principles of good research practice and in accordance with current legislation for various kinds of data in the field of research. KTH Library is responsible for reviews and questions about the policy document.
kth-royal-institute-of-technology.md,### 1 Managing research data
kth-royal-institute-of-technology.md,"KTH strives to ensure that the results of KTH’s research shall be digitally available and usable for researchers and society. Research data that has been fully or partially financed by public funds and forms the basis of published results must therefore be openly available, to the extent possible with due reference to legal, ethical and possible commercial aspects. KTH supports the internationally adopted FAIR principles to ensure that research data shall be findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable. These principles are compatible with the motto “As open as possible, as closed as necessary”."
kth-royal-institute-of-technology.md,#### 1.1 Creating a data management plan
kth-royal-institute-of-technology.md,Researchers must create a data management plan at an early stage in the research process in order to facilitate the management of research data.  Such a plan must state who is responsible for data management and for ensuring that management takes place with due consideration to ethical aspects and in accordance with current legislation. The technical solutions and work methods selected must satisfy the requirements of applicable regulations. It must in particular be clarified whether any stage of the research process involves the management of datasets that
kth-royal-institute-of-technology.md,are a public document in accordance with the Swedish Freedom of the Press Act
kth-royal-institute-of-technology.md,(1949:105) and how this information is to be made available;
kth-royal-institute-of-technology.md,are a general document subject to confidentiality in accordance with the Swedish Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act (2009:400) and that management takes place to ensure that confidentiality is not prejudiced;
kth-royal-institute-of-technology.md,are security-protected and that in such cases management takes place in accordance with security protection legislation;
kth-royal-institute-of-technology.md,are collected in such a way that an ethical review needs to take place in accordance with the current Swedish Ethical Review Act (2003:460);
kth-royal-institute-of-technology.md,contain personal data and that in such cases processing takes place in accordance with data protection legislation and that processing is recorded in KTH’s personal data processing register;
kth-royal-institute-of-technology.md,have a future research value and should be preserved in the long term in accordance with the Swedish National Archives’ regulations (RA-FS 1999:1).
kth-royal-institute-of-technology.md,The regulatory framework for research data management with regard to preservation is described in KTH’s information management plan. The data management plan shall be designed on the basis of this.
kth-royal-institute-of-technology.md,The data management plan can be revised continuously throughout the research process.
kth-royal-institute-of-technology.md,#### 1.2 Research data management in collaborations
kth-royal-institute-of-technology.md,"When research takes place in collaboration with other actors, data management must be clarified in, or in connection with, the research collaboration agreement that should be concluded between the parties. This must specify who is responsible, whether there are any reasons for confidentiality and, in cases where intellectual property values arise, who has the access rights and ownership rights. If there is processing of personal data, responsibility for this must be clearly specified."
kth-royal-institute-of-technology.md,"KTH strives to ensure that exclusive ownership rights to publish and reuse research data are not assigned to other actors, and that KTH retains access rights to use research data in future research and education."
kth-royal-institute-of-technology.md,#### 1.3 Publication of research data
kth-royal-institute-of-technology.md,"As a basic principle, research data that forms the basis of published research results should be made publicly available and be findable in such a way that data can be reused. When publishing research data or metadata about research data, KTH Royal Institute of Technology should be given as affiliation in the same way as for any other publication (see also Guidelines on Scientific Publications). It is also appropriate for the dataset to be assigned a persistent identifier and for there to be an opportunity for versioning when data is made available in connection with publication."
kth-royal-institute-of-technology.md,"Metadata must state clearly what conditions apply for access and reproduction of the dataset. If there are legal, ethical or commercial obstacles to complete digital availability, it is recommended that metadata be published describing the dataset including the conditions for access. If the publication of metadata is also considered inappropriate with regard to the protection of critical infrastructure or with regard to Sweden’s national security or information security in general, publication must be avoided."

kth-royal-institute-of-technology.md,KTH has ultimate responsibility for
kth-royal-institute-of-technology.md,"ensuring that the necessary digital infrastructure and appropriate services for good research data management are available; ensuring that KTH’s researchers can obtain advice and guidance on matters concerning the management, documentation, storage, preservation and sharing of research data."
kth-royal-institute-of-technology.md,"A person responsible for research data management should be appointed in the relevant data management plan. The person who is responsible for research data management should be sufficiently knowledgeable in the field of research to be able to make sure that the documentation of research data that is managed in the research process takes place in accordance with good research practice. If no responsible person has been appointed in the data management plan, the researcher responsible for the project is also the responsible for research data management. If the responsible person ceases to be employed at KTH, the head of school or the person delegated by the head of school assumes responsibility until a new person responsible for research data management is appointed."
kth-royal-institute-of-technology.md,"The person who is appointed is responsible for managing research data in accordance with good research practice, current legislation, commitments to research funding bodies and KTH’s policy document; drawing up necessary and adequate documentation of research data; ensuring that research data is made available in connection with publication with sufficient documentation to be findable and reusable."
lancaster-university.md,# Research Data Policy
lancaster-university.md,## Background
lancaster-university.md,"1. Management of data is an essential part of good research practice and all researchers in the University have an obligation to record, store and archive their data appropriately.  This brings with it the assurance that data supporting publications are available for analysis and will enable access by other researchers who could use the data, thus maximising the effectiveness of our research funding. The precise requirements of this and the procedures that should be used is a very complex issue when considering the wide range of information generated in research.  Thus the primary responsibility for research data management lies with individual researchers, and it is these staff who need to consider each individual project, whether it is appropriate to archive data and exactly what data should be stored.  However, this policy sets out our expectations, support and processes that are aimed at ensuring that research data from Lancaster is managed in the best possible way."
lancaster-university.md,IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THIS IS A RAPIDLY EVOLVING ENDEAVOUR SO THAT THE UNIVERSITY WILL BE CONTINUALLY AIMING TO DEVELOP THESE GUIDELINES.
lancaster-university.md,### What should researchers do?
lancaster-university.md,2. Researchers at Lancaster University will identify which projects are appropriate and which data are to be archived.  In this context they will then manage their data in such a way that they:
lancaster-university.md,"ensure research data and records are accurate, complete, authentic and reliable;"
lancaster-university.md,meet funding body grant requirements;
lancaster-university.md,ensure that confidentiality and anonymisation requirements are achieved;
lancaster-university.md,comply with the Data Protection Act and Freedom of Information legislation;
lancaster-university.md,maximise research efficiency by enabling others to use the data;
lancaster-university.md,minimise the risk of data loss (e.g. by data backup).
lancaster-university.md,"3. More specifically, Lancaster University expects that:"
lancaster-university.md,(I) all research will be carried out according to the principles laid out in the University Research Ethics Code of Practice;
lancaster-university.md,(II) primary responsibility for research data management during any research project or programme lies with the principal investigator;
lancaster-university.md,(III) the principal investigator will be responsible for clarifying responsibilities where data ownership may be ambiguous (e.g. in a multi-partner collaboration).  If a PI leaves Lancaster their Head of Department should ensure that appropriate provision has been made for data access;
lancaster-university.md,(IV) every member of a research team should be familiar with the data requirements of the organisation funding their research and of this University policy;
lancaster-university.md,(V) each project will have a data management plan that is produced at funding application stage or at the beginning of the project.  Note that some funders will have more rigorous conditions than those described here;
lancaster-university.md,"(VI) as a minimum, research data directly associated with publications should be archived;"
lancaster-university.md,"(VII) all research data to be archived must be associated with metadata which meets minimum standards set out in guidelines given on RSO website.  The metadata should be sufficient to enable other researchers to understand how it was created or acquired, and, if it is to be made openly available, to discover it and assess its reuse potential;"
lancaster-university.md,"(VIII) all research data will be stored in either electronic or paper form for a minimum of 10 years after the end of a project, unless ethical considerations, participant confidentiality, FOI requirements or external agencies e.g. NHS, specifically require otherwise;"
lancaster-university.md,(IX) research data will be submitted to national or international data services and repositories where available or required by either funders or publishers and this will replace the need for local archiving;
lancaster-university.md,"(X) exclusive rights to reuse or publish research data should not be handed over to commercial publishers or agents without retaining the rights to make the data openly available for re-use, unless this is a condition of the funding."
lancaster-university.md,### What will the University do?
lancaster-university.md,4. In order to support researchers and satisfy the requirements of the funders the University will:
lancaster-university.md,"4.1 store research processes/governance information and research management documentation in accordance with the Record Retention and Disposal Schedule Guidance.  The Research Support Office will store the following information in accordance with the Schedule and funders’ requirements: funders’ award letters, contracts and collaboration agreements, financial statements, claims and their relevant evidential documentation, audit certificates and ethical approval documentation;"
lancaster-university.md,"4.2 aim to provide mechanisms whereby research data that may be useful for other researchers but is not suitable for national repositories, can be archived appropriately.  The University will not provide central storage for physical items such as notebooks, artefacts etc. Individual researchers will be responsible for this;"
lancaster-university.md,"4.3 provide guidance and training where necessary, through our web site and Research Support Office, on the following:"
lancaster-university.md,(a) access to external repositories;
lancaster-university.md,(b) access to information on requirements of funders;
lancaster-university.md,(c) appropriate formats for data storage;
lancaster-university.md,(d) appropriate meta data for stored data;
lancaster-university.md,(e) decisions on what data to store;
lancaster-university.md,(f) the production of data management plans;
lancaster-university.md,"4.4 establish a review group, chaired by the Pro-Vice-Chancellor (Research and Enterprise), that will act as a point of advice and reference on decisions over the nature of data that needs to be archived;"
lancaster-university.md,"4.5 review annually, through the University Research Committee, this policy and the progress of the implementation plan;"
lancaster-university.md,4.6 consider collaborative approaches to data storage with other Universities.
lancaster-university.md,## Supporting resources
lancaster-university.md,5. Guidance on how to store data and the current requirements of major funders can be found at the Research Support Office Website.
lancaster-university.md,## Definitions
lancaster-university.md,"Research:  The HEFCE definition of research in relation to the REF is:  ‘Research’ is understood as original investigation undertaken in order to gain knowledge and understanding.  It includes work of direct relevance to the needs of commerce, industry, and to the public and voluntary sectors; scholarship [\*]; the invention and generation of ideas, images, performances, artefacts including design, where these lead to new or substantially improved insights; and the use of existing knowledge in experimental development to produce new or substantially improved materials, devices, products and processes, including design and construction.  It excludes routine testing and routine analysis of materials, components and processes such as for the maintenance of national standards, as distinct from the development of new analytical techniques.  It also excludes the development of teaching materials that do not embody original research."
lancaster-university.md,"Research Data:   This is not easy to define in a comprehensive way it is therefore important for each researcher to consider this in detail in the context of their own project.  To give a broad view the University of Melbourne uses the following definition:  “Research Data are facts, observations or experiences on which an argument, theory or test is based.  Data may be numerical, descriptive or visual.  Data may be raw or analysed, experimental or observational.  Data includes:  laboratory notebooks; field notebooks; primary research data (including research data in hardcopy or in computer readable form); questionnaires; audiotapes; videotapes; models; photographs; films; test responses.  Research collections may include slides; artefacts; specimens; samples.  Provenance information about the data might also be included: the how, when, where it was collected and with what (for example, instrument).  The software code used to generate, annotate or analyse the data may also be included”."
lancaster-university.md,Researcher:  In this context a researcher is a member of staff or student of Lancaster University who is performing research in the name of the University.

leeds-trinity-university.md,# Leeds Trinity University Research Data Management Policy
leeds-trinity-university.md,## Introduction
leeds-trinity-university.md,"Leeds Trinity University recognises that good research demands good data management in the support of academic integrity, openness and good stewardship. It will ensure that research data is managed to high standards throughout the research data lifecycle."
leeds-trinity-university.md,The effective management of Research Data will help us to:
leeds-trinity-university.md,meet the requirements of our funders
leeds-trinity-university.md,"recognise the value and impact of our research data, to ourselves and others"
leeds-trinity-university.md,improve the visibility of and our reputation for research and create opportunities for further research collaboration
leeds-trinity-university.md,"encourage open enquiry and allow results to be independently tested, improving the overall quality of research."
leeds-trinity-university.md,## Definition of Research Data
leeds-trinity-university.md,"Research data means information in digital, computer-readable format or paper based that:"
leeds-trinity-university.md,"is contained or presented in various ways including notes, facts, figures, tables, images (still and moving), audio or visual recordings; and"
leeds-trinity-university.md,"which is collected, generated or obtained during the course of or as a result of undertaking research (which includes but is not limited to"
leeds-trinity-university.md,"conducting field or laboratory experiments, conducting trials, surveys, interviews, focus groups or analysis of data); and"
leeds-trinity-university.md,"which is subsequently used by the researcher as a basis for making calculations or drawing conclusions to develop, support or revise theories, practices and findings."
leeds-trinity-university.md,"This policy encompasses data from research that has the potential for publication, regardless of whether or not the research is funded. It applies to research carried out by academic staff and Postgraduate Researchers, but is unlikely to apply to Undergraduate research except in exceptional circumstances."
leeds-trinity-university.md,# Policy
leeds-trinity-university.md,"1. Research data will be managed in accordance with funder, legislative and ethical requirements throughout the research data lifecycle."
leeds-trinity-university.md,"2. Use of others’ data should always conform to legal, ethical and regulatory frameworks including appropriate acknowledgement."
leeds-trinity-university.md,3. Responsibility for research data management during any research project or programme lies with responsible owners such as Principal Investigators (PIs
leeds-trinity-university.md,"4. A Data Management Plan that explicitly addresses the capture, managemen integrity, accessibility, usability, confidentiality, preservation, sharing and publication of research data must be created for each proposed research project or funding application at the outset. Sufficient metadata shall also be created and stored to aid discovery and re-use. Data management plans should take account of and ensure compliance with relevant legislative frameworks which may limit public access to the data (for example, in the areas of data protection, intellectual property and human rights)."
leeds-trinity-university.md,"5. If there are sound reasons why the openness of research data may need to be restricted (eg to protect commercial interests, protect individual confidentiality and privacy, avoid security risks, protect sensitive sites, etc), then justification for this must be included in the Data Management Plan."
leeds-trinity-university.md,"6. The University will provide mechanisms and services for storage, backup, registration, deposit and retention of research data assets in support of current and future access, during and after completion of research projects."
leeds-trinity-university.md,"7. Where possible, researchers should seek to recover the direct costs of managing research data generated by projects from the research funder."
leeds-trinity-university.md,"8. All research data should be offered for deposit and preservation in the University’s PURE Research Information System in a citable form, unless specified otherwise in the Data Management Plan."
leeds-trinity-university.md,"9. Data should not be deposited with any organisation that does not commit to its access and availability for re-use. Exclusive rights to reuse or publish research data should not be handed over to commercial publishers without retaining the rights to make the data openly available, unless this is a condition of funding."
leeds-trinity-university.md,"10. At the completion of each research project, the PI should ensure that all relevant research data are made available, subject to meeting appropriate requirements, in the location specified in the data management plan."
leeds-trinity-university.md,11. Research and Knowledge Exchange Committee will be responsible for reviewing and updating this policy.

leibniz-university-hannover.md,# Guidelines for Handling Research Data at Leibniz University Hannover
leibniz-university-hannover.md,## PREAMBLE
leibniz-university-hannover.md,Leibniz University Hannover recognises the importance of research data in the process of scientific research.
leibniz-university-hannover.md,These guidelines and the principles outlined in them are based in particular on the Alliance of German Science Organisations’ “Principles for the Handling of Research Data”1 and on the German Research Foundation’s (DFG) “Guidelines on the Handling of Research Data”.2
leibniz-university-hannover.md,"The reliable and responsible handling of research data is indispensable for the traceability of research and the dissemination of scientific findings. The production, processing, documentation, safeguarding, preservation and sustainable provision of research data should therefore take place in accordance with the recognised standards for each discipline and be based on the FAIR data principles.3 This guarantees that data and metadata are findable, accessible, interoperable and re-usable. At the same time, legal and ethical requirements, as well as the characteristics of and differences between scientific disciplines, should be observed."
leibniz-university-hannover.md,"LUH encourages the development of proper recognition for its researchers, who provide access to their high-quality research data in recognised repositories and archives in accordance with the FAIR principles."
leibniz-university-hannover.md,## DEFINITION OF RESEARCH DATA AT LEIBNIZ UNIVERSITY HANNOVER
leibniz-university-hannover.md,"Research data refers to all data that is collected and processed during the scientific research process. It forms the basis for scientific research findings. Depending on the scientific discipline, this can include very different types of data. Leibniz University Hannover adopts the DFG's definition of research data, which includes, among others, the following types of data: “measurement data, laboratory results, audiovisual information, texts, survey data, objects from collections, or samples […]. Methodical forms of testing such as questionnaires, software and simulations may also […] be categorised as research data.”4"
leibniz-university-hannover.md,"Research-data management ensures the accessibility, re-use, reproducibility and quality of research findings. It includes both the planning and the implementation of a process for the handling of research data. The cross-linking of research data with metadata throughout the research process ensures that data can be easily located and reused. An overview of subject-specific and cross-disciplinary metadata schemas is available in the RDA Metadata Directory.5"
leibniz-university-hannover.md,### PRINCIPLES
leibniz-university-hannover.md,"1. Research project heads and independent researchers are obligated to observe the principles of good scientific practice in order to prevent data loss, prepare research data for sustainable use, and document and archive this data.6 They are responsible for data management for their research activities and projects and for the integrity of the data collected."
leibniz-university-hannover.md,"2. Leibniz University Hannover requests that its researchers store, archive and publish research data in subject-specific repositories or in the university's existing institutional infrastructure – provided that this complies with legal and ethical requirements. This ensures that research data is freely accessible to the public, in accordance with the Leibniz University Hannover Open Access Policy.7, 8 At a minimum, research data should be freely available for scientific use, and to ensure reusability it should be assigned an open licence.9 The citation should likewise be assigned a persistent identifier, e.g. DOI (digital object identifier). Leibniz University Hannover recommends that its researchers use CC0 or CC BY licences to enable the extensive reuse of their work. This is in accordance with the requirements of the funding bodies as well as the FAIR data principles."
leibniz-university-hannover.md,3. Leibniz University Hannover advises its researchers to develop internal institute and/or project guidelines which establish detailed rules for handling research data. Researchers should also systematically draft and implement data management plans within the scope of project planning.
leibniz-university-hannover.md,4. Leibniz University Hannover recommends that its faculties and research schools integrate the subject-specific handling of research data into their teaching.
leibniz-university-hannover.md,### SUPPORTING THE IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS
leibniz-university-hannover.md,"Leibniz University Hannover supports its researchers throughout the entire research-data management process, from project planning to publication, with an advising and training programme. It also provides an institutional data repository.10 The advisory and training offers also cover issues related to ethical and legal requirements. This service combines the expertise of the TIB – Leibniz Information Centre for Science and Technology, the Leibniz University IT Services, and the Research and Innovation Services department. Up-to-date information about research-data management at Leibniz University Hannover is available on the university's research-data management website: www.fdm.uni-hannover.de/en"

leiden-university.md,# Research Data Management Regulations Leiden University
leiden-university.md,Focal points and explanations of the various articles appear in italic.
leiden-university.md,## A. Definitions and basis
leiden-university.md,1. These regulations are intended as a framework for a University research data management policy and require further elaboration at disciplinary level. Each Faculty Board must decide how the regulations will be further elaborated upon within the faculty and which role the institutes will play.
leiden-university.md,"2. Research data is understood to mean the following: all data that is gathered and generated during academic research. This also includes the data that is acquired by processing and analysing (raw) research data. We follow NWO here, which states, ‘we understand “data” to mean both gathered, unprocessed data and analysed, generated data.’ This does not mean that all data must also be preserved. The decision concerning which data to preserve is recorded at the disciplinary level (see article 16)."
leiden-university.md,3. These regulations apply to all digital and non-digital research data.
leiden-university.md,"We follow NWO policy here. Non-digital data can mean, for instance, preserved bio-material, audio recordings, paper questionnaires and paper lab journals. NB: this stipulation does not mean that all non-digital data must be digitised per se, but it does mean that the same requirements apply to non-digital data concerning findability, reusability, long-term preservation, etc."
leiden-university.md,### Before the research
leiden-university.md,4. A data management plan (DMP) must be drawn up before data collection for a research project begins. The DMP elaborates upon the data management policy of the faculty/institute for the specific research project in question.
leiden-university.md,### During the research
leiden-university.md,"5. During the research, research data must be securely preserved. This means that the integrity, availability and – if required – confidentiality of the data must be guaranteed. Please note: once the research has been completed, the research data must be preserved for the long term together with the metadata, software and other documentation required for reuse (Article 7). This must also be borne in mind during the research, for instance because it will generally be impossible to provide satisfactory metadata for all the data once the research has been completed."
leiden-university.md,### After the research
leiden-university.md,"6. Research data must be managed in such a way that, at the latest, - at the point in time of the last publication arising from the research, or at the point in time of the formal completion of the research project it is preserved so that it is at least findable, accessible, comprehensible and reusable in the long term."
leiden-university.md,"Two instances are mentioned here because not all research culminates in a publication. However, it"
leiden-university.md,is then also important that the research data is preserved and is findable. Externally funded
leiden-university.md,"research projects will generally formally conclude upon their financial-administrative completion. n explanation of the criteria that are used: Findable The data must be findable for other researchers and involved parties. Its findability improves if it is deposited in a (discipline-specific) data archive or repository. The information about the data (metadata) is then registered in a standardised manner and is findable, also for search engines. Future findability is guaranteed by assigning a persistent identifier to the data. A commonly used identifier for data is DOI (digital object identifier). A DOI is assigned by a data archive or data publisher and is a unique number for a digital object, in this case a dataset. The DOI remains the same even if the location of the dataset (URL) changes. A DOI or other persistent identifier is used in citations or references to the dataset. Accessible: Data accessibility does not necessarily mean that the data must immediately be made fully open. The data will have to be made accessible in some instances, for example for verification by a grant provider or journal, but will remain inaccessible to the wider public. With sensitive data, full publication will never be an option. Research data can be retained under embargo; then only those who have deposited the data have access to it. The duration of the embargo is determined in consultation with the data archive. A further option is only to grant access if a request for access is submitted to the researcher. The researcher then knows who is consulting the data and can reach agreements about its use and reuse. NB: if the decision is made to limit access to the data, it is essential that the metadata (description of the data) is findable. Comprehensible Metadata and any supplementary documentation must describe the data in such a way that other researchers will also be able to understand and use it. Reusable This criterion is further elaborated upon in Article 7. Long-term retention This criterion is further elaborated upon in Article 8. Research data must be stored together with the metadata, other documentation and"
leiden-university.md,possibly the software and version of the software required for its potential reuse.
leiden-university.md,"Research data must be stored in such a way that it is independent of the underlying equipment/hardware, such as microscopes, scanners or recording equipment. Long-term data formats that are supported by data archives should be used if possible. Retention of hardware can be considered in certain cases, for instance in the case of software that is only compatible with an obsolete computer operating system. Close attention must be paid to the cost/benefit ratio here. 8. Once the research has been completed, the research data must be retained securely for the long term. This means that the integrity, availability and – if required – confidentiality of the data must be guaranteed. The data should be retained according to international guidelines. For digital data this can be achieved by preserving it in a Trusted Digital Repository (an online depot). Non-digital research data must be preserved according to the prevailing standards in the discipline."
leiden-university.md,"A Trusted Digital Repository possesses equipment, hardware and software for the long term and reliable retention of digital information. This facility must be embedded in a reliable organisation that has a long-term mission and funding. There are three prevailing international standards for Trusted Digital Repositories and the manner in which they retain digital data for the long term. In ascending order of reliability requirements these are: the Data Seal of Approval1, the Nestor Seal2 (also known as DIN 31644) and the RAC standards3 (also known as ISO 16363). Data preservation at a repository with a Data Seal of Approval (the lowest category) currently suffices for NWO and Horizon 2020. It is recommended to digitise non-digital data as far as possible for long-term retention."
leiden-university.md,9. The minimum retention term for research data is ten years.
leiden-university.md,Here we follow The Netherlands Code of Conduct for Scientific Practice of the VSNU (2014 version).
leiden-university.md,## B. Responsibilities
leiden-university.md,"10. The Faculty Board is responsible for the further elaboration of these regulations and determines the level at which this takes place: at faculty and/or institute level. These regulations are a framework within which the faculty can determine its own policy. This will be sometimes only at faculty and sometimes only at institute level; sometimes a combination of both will be the most appropriate. With regard to the latter, this could mean general faculty regulations that have a specific appendix for each institute."
leiden-university.md,11. The academic director of the institute is responsible for the correct implementation of the policy. The DMPs for the research projects in the institute describe how the policy is implemented in practice (see below).
leiden-university.md,12. The DMP for a research project must record which data-management responsibilities are assigned to the various members of staff who are working on the project.
leiden-university.md,"Many research projects involve several researchers, for instance PhD candidates, postdocs and members of the permanent staff. The DMP records which responsibilities have been assigned to whom. Projects in which researchers from multiple institutes and/or external parties are involved require special attention. It is also important to record what will happen to the data and the responsibility for it if one of the researchers leaves."
leiden-university.md,13. All DMPs must be stored centrally within the faculty or institute for at least 20 years.
leiden-university.md,"Please note: if a DMP is destroyed, the researcher or institute can no longer demonstrate how certain decisions concerning the destruction of data were made (with regard to academic integrity). The retention term is longer for a DMP than for the data, because the DMP can then be used in any instances that arise to demonstrate that the destruction of a certain dataset (for instance after the standard ten years) was in line with the DMP."
leiden-university.md,14. A data protection officer is appointed at university level who is responsible for adherence to the policy with regard to the security of research data.
leiden-university.md,"If research proposals are being granted funding within the Horizon 2020 framework, the data protection officer may be asked to provide a statement to the effect that the ‘technical data protection procedures’ will be adhered to within the project. The data protection officer is thus responsible for the protection of the research data during the project."
leiden-university.md,15. The Executive Board is responsible for providing the facilities and support that make reliable data management possible.
leiden-university.md,"This does not mean that all facilities and support must necessarily be offered within the University; if required and beneficial, agreements can be reached with national or international parties who offer facilities and/or support in the field of data management."
leiden-university.md,## C. Elaboration
leiden-university.md,"16. In the elaboration of these University regulations, the following aspects at least must be addressed. Derogations from these regulations must be recorded and well-motivated. The elaboration of the regulations should correspond with the standards that currently prevail in the discipline. How data-management responsibilities are assigned within the institute; Which data needs to be retained, given the type of research conducted in the institute; What the policy is concerning data arising from bachelor’s, master’s and research master’s programmes (and theses in particular); How the requirement that the integrity, availability and confidentiality of the data must be guaranteed will be met during the research; How, once the research has been completed, the requirement will be met that at the time of the research’s publication the data must be retained in such a way that it remains findable, accessible, comprehensible and reusable in the long term. A possible maximum retention term for data and DMPs."
leiden-university.md,### 17. The following aspects at least must be covered in the DMP for a research project:
leiden-university.md,"How data-management responsibilities are assigned within the project and what will happen if the researcher, or one of the researchers, leaves;"
leiden-university.md,The types of data that will be generated and collected (with format and scope);
leiden-university.md,The collection method(s) or origin of the data (including hardware and software);
leiden-university.md,The standards and metadata for the documentation of the data (discipline-focused and/or in line with standards set by the repository where the data is preserved);
leiden-university.md,Where the data will be preserved during the research and how security and access will be arranged;
leiden-university.md,The measures that will be taken for the long-time preservation of and access to the data; Who will have access to the data at which point;
leiden-university.md,How sensitive or otherwise confidential data is dealt with.
leiden-university.md,Researchers can use the templates that grant providers such as NWO and the European
leiden-university.md,"Commission use to draw up a DMP. The University has also created such a template. In the DMP,"
leiden-university.md,researchers can in part refer to or draw upon the data management policy of their faculty or institute.
leiden-university.md,"18. All the above articles have an implementation term of three years from the time of establishment, with the exception of the appointment of the data protection officer. The proposed policy has such an impact that it is not realistic to make it compulsory within the short term. Opting for an extended implementation period means that faculties and institutes each have the opportunity to apply their own phasing-in plan. This does not alter the fact that in particular researchers who wish to submit grant proposals will probably already need to follow the greater part of this policy in the short term."
leiden-university.md,19. These regulations do not have retroactive effect.
leiden-university.md,"In principle, data collected in research projects that have already been completed therefore does not fall under the regulations. There is a grey area here if a new project builds upon previously collected data; it will be necessary to examine on a case-by-case basis whether it is possible to preserve the old data for the long term."
leiden-university.md,"20. If there is due cause, these regulations will be revised by the Executive Board during the implementation phase above. At least the Research Council, the ICT and Research Steering Group and the Information Managers Platform must be consulted for such a revision."
leiden-university.md,The Research Data Management Regulations were established by the Executive Board on 19 April 2016.

london-school-of-hygiene--tropical-medicine-university-of-london.md,2.2 This Research Data Management Policy (henceforth RDM Policy) sets out expectations for how researchers should manage and share research data under their control in accordance with good research practice.
london-school-of-hygiene--tropical-medicine-university-of-london.md,"2.3 The RDM Policy forms a component of LSHTM’s over-arching research governance framework, which regulates the research undertaken at LSHTM. It should be read in conjunction with institutional, national, international, and other requirements that apply to research data. This includes, but is not limited to, ethical and legal conditions that apply to the handling of human data."
london-school-of-hygiene--tropical-medicine-university-of-london.md,"2.4 The RDM Policy establishes LSHTM’s commitment to complying with the Concordat on Open Research Data, a framework for best practice within UK HEIs with respect to research data management. It forms a component of LSHTM’s research governance framework and should be read in conjunction with the policies and procedures outlined in the References section."
london-school-of-hygiene--tropical-medicine-university-of-london.md,## 3 POLICY
london-school-of-hygiene--tropical-medicine-university-of-london.md,The London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) defines the following principles to be followed by researchers in order to ensure research data are managed and disseminated in accordance with good research practice.
london-school-of-hygiene--tropical-medicine-university-of-london.md,Guidance on addressing the principles can be found on ServiceDesk
london-school-of-hygiene--tropical-medicine-university-of-london.md,"(  and the intranet (  One-to-one support is available from the Research Data Manager within the Library, Archive & Open Research Services."
london-school-of-hygiene--tropical-medicine-university-of-london.md,### 3.1. LSHTM-led research projects working with research data must create a Data Management Plan
london-school-of-hygiene--tropical-medicine-university-of-london.md,"A Data Management Plan (DMP) is a formal document that outlines how research assets, such as data, code, and other support material, will be obtained, managed and shared during the research lifecycle and following its completion. It outlines how the researcher will address requirements that apply to the research and steps that will be taken to ensure it can be verified and reused."
london-school-of-hygiene--tropical-medicine-university-of-london.md,"LSHTM-led research projects working with research data must prepare a Data Management Plan (DMP) before the commencement of research, even if not required by their research funder."
london-school-of-hygiene--tropical-medicine-university-of-london.md,A Data Management Plan should be written at the appropriate stage:
london-school-of-hygiene--tropical-medicine-university-of-london.md,"Public/private funded research should prepare a Data Management Plan prior to submission of a research application or within the first 3 months of project funding, as required by the funder."
london-school-of-hygiene--tropical-medicine-university-of-london.md,PhD/DrPH students should agree a Data Management Plan with their Supervisor and submit it as part of their Upgrading or Review Report.
london-school-of-hygiene--tropical-medicine-university-of-london.md,"Researchers that are unfunded, working with 3rd party data only, performing consultancy, undertaking an MSc project solely in pursuit of a qualification are encouraged to prepare Data Management Plan, but are not covered by this mandate."
london-school-of-hygiene--tropical-medicine-university-of-london.md,"It is advisable to develop a Data Management Plan in conjunction with other relevant documents, such as the research plan/protocol and Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA), where appropriate."
london-school-of-hygiene--tropical-medicine-university-of-london.md,All researchers associated with a research project must be made aware of and abide by the Data Management Plan.
london-school-of-hygiene--tropical-medicine-university-of-london.md,"The Data Management Plan should be reviewed and updated at appropriate stages during the research lifecycle. It is recommended that it is reviewed and updated when significant changes are made to the project work plan or every six months, as a minimum."
london-school-of-hygiene--tropical-medicine-university-of-london.md,"Funder-specific templates and guidance for writing a Data Management Plan should be followed, where applicable. If no funder template exists, LSHTM provides templates that may be used (see Related Policies & Procedures)."
london-school-of-hygiene--tropical-medicine-university-of-london.md,"### 3.2. Data management costs should be recovered from the research funder, where permitted"
london-school-of-hygiene--tropical-medicine-university-of-london.md,"Costs associated with the capture, management, archiving, and sharing of research data during the project lifetime and following its completion should be considered at the earliest opportunity, preferably when preparing the research application, so that suitable arrangements can be made."
london-school-of-hygiene--tropical-medicine-university-of-london.md,"Researchers should review research funder guidelines on allowed costs and, where permitted, write these into the justification of resources and budget of the research application. Common examples of data management costs include hardware and software purchases, data-related training, staff time for data preparation, and use of third-party services."
london-school-of-hygiene--tropical-medicine-university-of-london.md,Advice on research data costs may be obtained from the Research Data Manager.
london-school-of-hygiene--tropical-medicine-university-of-london.md,### 3.3. Data rights should be recognised and agreed at the earliest opportunity
london-school-of-hygiene--tropical-medicine-university-of-london.md,"Researchers should clarify intellectual property rights and custodianship for research data and other research assets that are used in research at the earliest opportunity. This will ensure that it can be collected, stored, managed and shared in compliance with relevant conditions that apply to research. This includes ethical, legal, regulatory, contractual, and/or other requirements."
london-school-of-hygiene--tropical-medicine-university-of-london.md,"The rights of research participants to engage with decision-making is recognized as important for ensuring they benefit from work undertaken, in line with guidelines such as the CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance. Research participants must be provided with sufficient information to understand and influence how their information will be stored, analysed and shared as part of the research process. Guidance may be found in the LSHTM Standard Operating Procedure on Informed Consent (LSHTM-SOP-005) and relevant SOPs at the respective MRC Units in Gambia and Uganda."
london-school-of-hygiene--tropical-medicine-university-of-london.md,"Research partners should agree on a collaboration agreement that clearly indicates the rights they possess and permissions they provide to ensure research data can be used for current and future research. Rights will often be owned by the host institution(s) in which researchers are based, rather than the researcher themselves, therefore it is important that this agreement is reviewed and approved by the relevant institution’s legal team. Advice on preparing collaboration agreements and sample templates can be obtained from the LSHTM Legal Services Office."
london-school-of-hygiene--tropical-medicine-university-of-london.md,"Exclusive rights to ownership or use of research data should not be handed over to a third party, unless it is a condition imposed by contractual or other obligations, without first consulting the Research Data Manager or LSHTM Legal Services Office for advice. Instead, researchers are encouraged to apply a non-exclusive licence that enables research data to be accessed and used by many parties."
london-school-of-hygiene--tropical-medicine-university-of-london.md,Further information can be found in the LSHTM Good Research Practice Policy and LSHTM Intellectual Property Policy.
london-school-of-hygiene--tropical-medicine-university-of-london.md,### 3.4. Research data must be securely stored and managed throughout the time period they are retained
london-school-of-hygiene--tropical-medicine-university-of-london.md,"Research data and other research assets must be securely stored and managed throughout the time period that they are held. This must ensure the confidentiality of information, protect against data loss and corruption, and comply with requirements that apply to the research. This includes ethical, legal, contractual, or other requirements, most notably the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 (UK DPA 2018)."
london-school-of-hygiene--tropical-medicine-university-of-london.md,The managed storage environment may be operated by LSHTM and/or a trusted third party. Advice and guidance on classifying research data by its sensitivity level and selecting appropriate storage methods are available in the LSHTM Data Classification and Handling Policy and LSHTM Data Storage Options document.
london-school-of-hygiene--tropical-medicine-university-of-london.md,"In circumstances where a managed storage environment is not available (e.g. when working in the field), researchers must take all reasonable steps to ensure adequate measures are in place to protect research data and ensure they are not held in a jurisdiction that offers lower levels of protection than available in the UK. The research data must be transferred into a managed storage environment at the earliest opportunity."
london-school-of-hygiene--tropical-medicine-university-of-london.md,Advice on LSHTM storage systems may be sought from LSHTM IT Services.
london-school-of-hygiene--tropical-medicine-university-of-london.md,"### 3.5. Documentation should be sufficient to access, understand, verify and reuse research data"
london-school-of-hygiene--tropical-medicine-university-of-london.md,"The ability to access, understand and use research data for the purpose of research verification or new research, is dependent upon the existence and availability of documentation that is full, clear and accurate."
london-school-of-hygiene--tropical-medicine-university-of-london.md,Researchers should ensure that they produce documentation that complies with research practices and reporting guidelines appropriate to the scientific domain(s) in which their research is conducted.
london-school-of-hygiene--tropical-medicine-university-of-london.md,"Research data that are made available should be supported by documentation that enable others to access, understand and use it, without the need to contact the study authors. Documentation that may be shared include: data collection tools, research protocols and procedures, participant informed consent forms, processing scripts, software code, data dictionaries and other outputs."
london-school-of-hygiene--tropical-medicine-university-of-london.md,Further information on documentation practices can be found in the LSHTM Standard Operating Procedure on Good Documentation Practice (LSHTM-SOP-022).
london-school-of-hygiene--tropical-medicine-university-of-london.md,### 3.6. Research data that contribute to research findings must be retained for the time period that they are needed
london-school-of-hygiene--tropical-medicine-university-of-london.md,Researchers are responsible for ensuring research data necessary to verify and reproduce research findings are retained for the time period that they are needed.
london-school-of-hygiene--tropical-medicine-university-of-london.md,"Research data produced by a researcher must be kept in digital and/or physical form for a minimum of 10 years following funding completion, in accordance with LSHTM’s Records Retention and Disposal Schedule."
london-school-of-hygiene--tropical-medicine-university-of-london.md,"A minimum retention period longer than 10 years may be specified by third parties for specific types of research. For instance, research data produced as part of a clinical trial must be kept for a minimum of 25 years. Similarly, research data that underpins published research findings must often be made available for a minimum of 10 years after the date that it was published, in accordance with journal requirements."
london-school-of-hygiene--tropical-medicine-university-of-london.md,Data provided by a third party that contains a contractual condition that it is held for a shorter time period are exempt from this requirement.
london-school-of-hygiene--tropical-medicine-university-of-london.md,"A decision to dispose of research data or other research assets under the researcher’s control may be made after the retention period has passed, in consultation with relevant staff. Appropriate documentation should be maintained on any research assets that are selected for disposal, in compliance with guidance outlined in the LSHTM Records Retention and Disposal Schedule and its supporting documents."
london-school-of-hygiene--tropical-medicine-university-of-london.md,"Further information can be found in the LSHTM Standard Operating Procedure on Data Destruction (LSHTM SOP 043) and the LSHTM Records Retention and Disposal Schedule.

loughborough-university.md,"2.   New research proposals from 9th September 2016 should include research data management plans or protocols in line with funders’ policies. In other instances, research data management plans are encouraged. All plans should include responsibilities for data collection, documentation and metadata, ethical and legal compliance, storage and backup, selection of data of long-term value, preservation and data sharing."
loughborough-university.md,3.   Research data management plans should ensure that research data are available for access and re-use wherever appropriate and under appropriate safeguards.
loughborough-university.md,"4.   To enable research data to be discoverable and effectively re-used by others, sufficient metadata should be recorded and made openly available via the University data repository. The link to the repository can be found here:"
loughborough-university.md,"5.   All research data of continuing value to the researcher and the wider research community, or specified by funding bodies, or required for legal or other regulatory purposes should be registered with the University, even that which is retained elsewhere, for example in an international data service or domain repository."
loughborough-university.md,"6.   Research data that may be of future historical interest, including data that substantiate research findings, should normally be offered and assessed for deposit and retention in an appropriate data service or domain repository, or the University data repository."
loughborough-university.md,7.   The legitimate interests of the subjects of research data must be protected.
loughborough-university.md,"8.   Exclusive rights to reuse or publish research data should not be handed over to commercial publishers or agents without retaining the rights to make the data openly available for reuse, unless this is a condition of funding."
loughborough-university.md,"9.   Where any research is subject to any associated contractual arrangements and/or grant conditions that conflict with this policy, the provisions of such contractual arrangements and/or grant conditions will take precedence."
loughborough-university.md,#### Researchers’ responsibilities
loughborough-university.md,"Responsibility for the creation of a research data management plan, the updating of that plan (where necessary), and the implementation of that plan throughout the research lifecycle during any research project or programme lies with Principal Investigators (PIs). Heads of Departments and Centres and others responsible for research staff and students should ensure that researchers in their areas are aware of the University’s policy regarding research data management and its associated guidelines and procedures."
loughborough-university.md,Researchers are required to comply with the conditions of their of their research funders’ data policies.
loughborough-university.md,Researchers should ensure published results always include information on how to access the supporting data.
loughborough-university.md,"PIs should review their data holdings assessing their research value e.g. for potential future use in research and education, and wider applications for policy, commerce or public interests."
loughborough-university.md,PIs should notify the University of their data holdings and supply the Data Asset Register (currently the University data repository) with metadata relating to their data.
loughborough-university.md,### University’s responsibilities
loughborough-university.md,"The University will provide access to training, support, advice and, where appropriate, guidelines and templates for research data management and research data management plans."
loughborough-university.md,"The University will provide access to mechanisms and services for storage, backup, registration, valuation, deposit and retention of research data assets in support of current and future access, during and after completion of research projects."

lund-university.md,## Guidelines concerning research data storage at the Faculties of Humanities and Theology
lund-university.md,"Lund University is a public authority and is therefore obliged to preserve, organise and maintain all public documents from the University’s activities (Swedish Archives Act 1990:782, section 3). As documents resulting from research at the Faculties of Humanities and Theology are increasingly digital, it is of the utmost importance to establish procedures to ensure that the data will remain available in a way that corresponds to the current paper documents."
lund-university.md,The long-term goal of introducing these new procedures is to promote:
lund-university.md,open research
lund-university.md,good research practice and good data management in the research process good regulatory compliance
lund-university.md,future access to research data.
lund-university.md,"Research data1 refers to all types of research documents defined in Lund University’s document management plan2, i.e. both those to be preserved and those to be disposed of after a specified retention period. Any disposal must be in accordance with the Swedish National Archives’ regulations. The rules that apply can be found in the document “Gallrings- och bevarandeplan för forskningshandlingar inom de Humanistiska och teologiska fakulteterna” (Disposal and preservation plan for research documents at the Faculties of Humanities and Theology), reg. no V 2019/2171. Storage of research data should also take into account current rules regarding e.g. information and IT security, personal data processing and ethical principles."
lund-university.md,Doctoral students’ research documents are considered part of Lund University’s portfolio of public documents and are therefore also covered by these guidelines.
lund-university.md,"When the term “researcher” is used below, it refers all research staff, regardless of the type of employment, and thus also all research students."
lund-university.md,"The short-term goal of introducing these procedures is to clarify the organisation’s requirements and expectations of researchers, and to:"
lund-university.md,support researchers in their data management by providing storage space
lund-university.md,for research data during and after the project period
lund-university.md,"ensure that the faculty’s research data can always be found, without help"
lund-university.md,from the researcher
lund-university.md,prepare for the possibility of somewhat automatically transferring data and
lund-university.md,"metadata to a planned e-archive at Lund University, without requiring each"
lund-university.md,researcher to participate in the process
lund-university.md,"In addition to having a clearly identified location for research project data3, we need to be able to distinguish between active data and archived data. We also need to organise the data in a structured manner. Long-term preservation must take place in open file formats that make the data accessible even in the long term."
lund-university.md,"The legal rights and obligations apply, irrespective of the choice of storage solution. The same rules apply as long as the document is stored with the public authority – regardless of where or how it is stored."
lund-university.md,"Bear in mind that there are other requirements that apply to research data, in addition to these storage guidelines. If, for example, the project processes personal data, this must be reported via the PULU4 form. Ethical review may also be required, etc."
lund-university.md,"By following the research data storage procedures below, we also:"
lund-university.md,satisfy the Swedish Archives Act’s requirement to preserve and keep research documents organised
lund-university.md,are able to link research projects in LUCRIS to their research data
lund-university.md,"enable secure storage during the project period and prepare for e-archiving ensure that research data remains at LU, even after the researcher’s employment has terminated"
lund-university.md,"enable responding, if necessary, to suspicions of research misconduct by being able to produce evidence in the form of preserved research data facilitate the creation of well-organised data sets that can easily be cited, shared and re-used by the researcher or others to answer new research questions, if needed."
lund-university.md,### Research data storage procedures at the Faculties of Humanities and Theology
lund-university.md,"The procedures apply to all researchers working at the Faculties of Humanities and Theology and to all research projects that have their main residence at one of the faculty organisations. In brief, this means that the research data during the project period should, and at the end of the project must:"
lund-university.md,be stored in a project folder associated with the applicable storage solution be organised according to the standard structure
lund-university.md,contain metadata about the project and its data
lund-university.md,contain the necessary documentation
lund-university.md,be stored in open file format
lund-university.md,be given file names that facilitate understanding of the content
lund-university.md,"be disposed of5, if possible, at the end of the retention period."
lund-university.md,The research project manager in charge is also responsible for ensuring that the project’s research data is stored securely throughout the project period and that the right people have access to the project data. You must also ensure that the necessary decisions on disposal/preservation are taken no later than at the end of the project (see below).
lund-university.md,Below are more detailed descriptions of the requirements and related comments.
lund-university.md,"During the project period, the project data must be stored in a work folder specifically intended for the project, in the storage solution provided by the IT unit."
lund-university.md,"This ensures secure storage of data during the project period. If another storage solution is chosen, for example, if an equivalent solution is provided by another IT provider, an assessment of information security must be made. In cases where the research data is of such a sensitive nature that the storage solution does not meet all the information security considerations or ethical principles, another storage solution must be chosen6."
lund-university.md,The project folder shall contain the following four main subfolders:
lund-university.md,Administration Method
lund-university.md,Data
lund-university.md,Research output
lund-university.md,Only research documents that are not suitable for LUCRIS may be added to the Research output folder.
lund-university.md,"The requirement applies primarily to the archived project folder, but in order to avoid further work in connection with the archiving process, we recommend that you apply this structure in the project folder already during the project period. The research project manager is free to determine the organisation of the data within these folders, but consideration should be given to making the structure understandable and logical for other researchers."
lund-university.md,Metadata on the project and its data shall be stored in the Data folder.
lund-university.md,"At least one README file shall be placed at the top of the folder. The text should explain what can be found in the folder, how different files relate to each other, etc. in order for other researchers to understand and possibly utilise the research data."
lund-university.md,"The minimum requirement for project metadata is based on the “OpenAIRE guidelines for Data Archives”7, which in turn are based on the Dublin Core8. Metadata is important for future indexing, searching and possibly also statistics. Text elements that are part of the metadata structure must be written in either Swedish or English. The libraries at the Faculties of Humanities and Theology provide a template for this. The template includes requirements for a link to the project in LUCRIS."
lund-university.md,"If necessary, additional README files or other information documents may be added to the structure if deemed necessary by the research project manager."
lund-university.md,Required documentation in addition to metadata.
lund-university.md,"Other documentation that is necessary for an outside researcher to understand and interpret the contents of the folder may be e.g. method descriptions, field journals and manuals for applied software or hardware. The files in the folder must be stored in open file format."
lund-university.md,The choice of file format for digital documents is very important in order to ensure that the data will remain accessible in the future. Non-proprietary open formats shall be used as far as possible. The choice of format shall be based on the Swedish National Archives’ regulations and general advice on technical requirements for electronic documents9.
lund-university.md,File names that facilitate understanding of the content shall be used.
lund-university.md,"The choice of file name is important, but what constitutes a good file name depends on the context. Use names that make the content understandable as well as logical to external researchers."
lund-university.md,"On completion of the project, the project data shall be stored in a designated project folder in the archived storage solution provided by the IT unit. The data to be preserved shall be kept separate from the data deemed eligible for disposal."
lund-university.md,"The research project manager is responsible for archiving any documents in the project folder that are to be preserved and that a decision on possible disposal is taken no later than at the end of the project period – which does not necessarily coincide with the termination of funding. Decisions on disposal must always be taken in accordance with current regulations (see “Gallrings- och bevarandeplan för forskningshandlingar vid de Humanistiska och teologiska fakulteterna” (Disposal and preservation plan for research documents at the Faculties of Humanities and Theology), reg. no V 2019/2171)10, i.e. disposal of documents requires approval from the head of department."
lund-university.md,"For research ethical reasons, research data shall be stored for at least 10 years after publication, in order to enable critical review of the research findings."
lund-university.md,"If the project processes personal data, this must be reported to the data protection officer at the end of the project, as the register (the PULU system) must only contain ongoing processing of personal data."
lund-university.md,Data eligible for disposal are automatically disposed of at the end of the retention period.
lund-university.md,"After assessing the preservation value, which is done in consultation between researchers and the head of department (see above), the IT unit transfers the documents deemed disposable after the retention period by the head of department to the corresponding folder at the intermediate archive of the Faculties of Humanities and Theology. The documents will automatically be disposed of at the end of the retention period. The documents that are to be preserved remain in the project folder, which is then transferred in its entirety to the storage solution for archived material."
lund-university.md,#### Further information in related instructions
lund-university.md,"For more detailed instructions on how to apply these procedures in practice, for example, which files to store and which file formats are approved, see the Instructions for research data storage at the Faculties of Humanities and Theology (“Anvisningar för forskningsdatalagring vid HT-fakulteterna”). The research support offered by the faculty libraries, in collaboration with the IT unit, also includes support with regard to research data storage and the procedures laid down in the present guidelines."
manchester-metropolitan-university-mmu.md,# Manchester Metropolitan University Research Data Management Policy
manchester-metropolitan-university-mmu.md,## 1. Introduction
manchester-metropolitan-university-mmu.md,"1.1 Manchester Metropolitan University firmly believes that good research data management is the foundation of good research, since it allows for the verification of findings and supports digital preservation."
manchester-metropolitan-university-mmu.md,"1.2 Publicly funded research data are a public good, produced in the public interest, which should be made openly available with as few restrictions as possible in a timely and responsible manner.1"
manchester-metropolitan-university-mmu.md,"1.3 The benefits of opening up research data for scrutiny and reuse are potentially very significant; including economic growth, increased resource efficiency, securing public support for research funding and increasing public trust in research. However, openness requires more"
manchester-metropolitan-university-mmu.md,"1.4 than disclosure of data. All those engaged with research have a responsibility to ensure that the data they gather and generate is properly managed, accessible, intelligible, and usable by others unless there are legitimate reasons to the contrary2."
manchester-metropolitan-university-mmu.md,"1.5 The University supports FAIR Principles for data sharing making data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable."
manchester-metropolitan-university-mmu.md,## 2. Purpose
manchester-metropolitan-university-mmu.md,2.1 Manchester Metropolitan University has a clear strategy to develop the research environment and ensure research excellence. This policy demonstrates the University’s commitment to adhering to and promoting research data management best practice throughout the research lifecycle and is in accordance with the Concordat on Open Research Data and its principles. This policy outlines the responsibilities of both the
manchester-metropolitan-university-mmu.md,University and its researchers in relation to research data management and sets out the support and guidance that is available.
manchester-metropolitan-university-mmu.md,## 3. Scope
manchester-metropolitan-university-mmu.md,"3.1 This policy applies to any individual engaging in research as part of their employment or studies at the University, involving in the creation, collection, generation, processing or destruction of research data, regardless of whether or not the research is funded."
manchester-metropolitan-university-mmu.md,"3.2 Researcher leaders, supervisors and mentors should ensure that their collaborators, colleagues and students are aware of the relevant research data management requirements and have a clear understanding of appropriate practice."
manchester-metropolitan-university-mmu.md,## 4. Definitions
manchester-metropolitan-university-mmu.md,### 4.1 Researcher
manchester-metropolitan-university-mmu.md,A Researcher references any individual engaging in research as part of their employment or studies at the University.
manchester-metropolitan-university-mmu.md,### 4.2 Research Data
manchester-metropolitan-university-mmu.md,"UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) defines research data as 'the evidence that underpins the answer to the research question, and can be used to validate findings regardless of its form (e.g. print, digital or physical)."
manchester-metropolitan-university-mmu.md,"These might be quantitative information or qualitative statements collected by researchers in the course of their work by experimentation, observation, modelling, interview or other methods, or information derived from existing evidence. Data may be raw or primary (e.g. direct from measurement or collection) or derived from primary data for subsequent analysis or interpretation (e.g. cleaned up or as an extract from a larger data set), or derived from existing sources where the rights may be held by others."
manchester-metropolitan-university-mmu.md,"Data may be defined as 'relational' or 'functional' components of research, thus signalling that their identification lies in whether and how researchers use them as evidence for claims."
manchester-metropolitan-university-mmu.md,"They may include, for example, statistics, collections of digital images, sound recordings, transcripts of interviews, survey data and fieldwork observations with appropriate annotations, an interpretation, an artwork, archives, found objects, published texts or a manuscript.3"
manchester-metropolitan-university-mmu.md,Manchester Metropolitan University recognises three main states for research data:
manchester-metropolitan-university-mmu.md,"Active research data (e.g. live digital project data in the research data storage platform) Archived research data (e.g. ‘finished’ / ‘end of project’ data prepared for long-term preservation. This may contain sensitive personal information. This is archived for legal, regulatory or contractual purposes and is not publicly accessible) Reusable research data (e.g. a dataset that has been made findable, sharable and available for reuse through the most appropriate repository / data archive. This is subject to ethical, legal"
manchester-metropolitan-university-mmu.md,and contractual requirements)
manchester-metropolitan-university-mmu.md,"For the purposes of this policy ‘research data’ refers to active, archived or reusable data, that is created, collected, generated, processed or destroyed by any researcher at the University."
manchester-metropolitan-university-mmu.md,### 4.3 Data Management Plans (DMPs)
manchester-metropolitan-university-mmu.md,"A Data Management Plan (DMP) is a formal statement describing how data will be managed and documented throughout a research project. A DMP should address the capture, handling, integrity, confidentiality, preservation, sharing, publication and destruction of the research data. DMPs are living documents and therefore should be periodically reviewed and updated to ensure their effectiveness. Manchester Metropolitan University expects all research data to have an associated and proportionate DMP."
manchester-metropolitan-university-mmu.md,### 4.4 Metadata
manchester-metropolitan-university-mmu.md,"Metadata are defined as information about data. In the context of research data management this concerns any descriptive or contextual information related to research data that contributes towards its discoverability, long-term preservation, and reuse. Metadata can range from simple explanatory text documents to extensive structured metadata schemas."
manchester-metropolitan-university-mmu.md,## Roles and Responsibilities
manchester-metropolitan-university-mmu.md,### 4.5 Researcher’s Responsibilities
manchester-metropolitan-university-mmu.md,4.5.1 The Principal Investigator (PI) is responsible for ensuring ethical approval is obtained for all research projects beforeany data collection takes place.
manchester-metropolitan-university-mmu.md,"4.5.2 The PI has overall responsibility for research data management before, during and after any project or programme. Research data management duties may be shared or delegated but should be clearly outlined in a DMP."
manchester-metropolitan-university-mmu.md,"4.5.3 All researchers are responsible for familiarising themselves with the research project DMP and complying with all legal4, contractual, ethical or regulatory requirements that are associated with the data in their research project."
manchester-metropolitan-university-mmu.md,"4.5.4 All researchers are responsible for ensuring their project data are processed, transferred and stored in a secure manner that preservesits integrity. Active data must be securely stored on the University’s research data storage platform, or an appropriate alternative, in accordance with the specified contractual requirements."
manchester-metropolitan-university-mmu.md,"4.5.5 Where data ownership may be ambiguous (e.g.in collaborative projects with external organisations), the PI will be responsible for clarifying responsibilities."
manchester-metropolitan-university-mmu.md,"4.5.6 The PI is responsible for appraising and preparing active data for archiving and reuse. Data that is shared should align with FAIR principles, use a suitable format to allow verification of published research findings, and be of long-term academic value."
manchester-metropolitan-university-mmu.md,"4.5.7 The Pl is responsible for ensuring the research dataare suitably archived and shared in the University’s research repository (or appropriate alternative), subject to specific legal, contractual, ethical or regulatory requirements."
manchester-metropolitan-university-mmu.md,4.5.8 The PI is responsible for destroying data that cannot be retained due to legal requirements or that is not of long-term value as specified in the DMP.
manchester-metropolitan-university-mmu.md,### 4.6 The University’s Responsibilities
manchester-metropolitan-university-mmu.md,"4.6.1   The University is responsible for providing appropriate infrastructure for secure data storage through a centralised storage solution in order to ensure the safety, integrity and accessibility of live research data."

medizinische-universität-graz.md,## Preamble
medizinische-universität-graz.md,"The Medical University of Graz (Med Uni Graz) recognises the fundamental importance of research data management, including the importance of maintaining the accompanying records, to ensure high-quality research and scientific integrity. It strives to promote the highest standard in this regard in accordance with the FAIR principles. Accurate, easily retrievable and traceable research data are a fundamental and integral part of any scientific research activity. These data are also essential in that they allow research processes and results to be reviewed and defended, among other things. Research data are of lasting value to research and teaching, opening up the potential for their broad use by members of society."
medizinische-universität-graz.md,Research data shall be handled exclusively in accordance with the applicable national and international legal provisions.
medizinische-universität-graz.md,"Due to the diversity of research data and processes, it is not possible to define uniform guidelines for the management of research data in detail (e.g. with regard to file structures, repositories, software, metadata). In addition, both the requirements and data management systems develop differently and extremely dynamically in specific research areas. For these reasons, this policy establishes general principles that are independent of research topics and will be continuously adapted as a living document to take into account current developments."
medizinische-universität-graz.md,## 1. Scope
medizinische-universität-graz.md,"This research data management policy refers to the collection, documentation, processing, utilisation, storage and further use of data and applies to all persons working at Med Uni Graz (e.g. researchers, non-scientific employees involved in the research process, students, doctors and employees of the University Hospital Graz and guest researchers) and their research activities. In principle, the policy also applies to those research activities that are promoted, financed, or materially supported by a third party and should be reflected in the corresponding contracts insofar as possible. If questions arise, the provisions established in the specific contract take precedence over the provisions of this policy."
medizinische-universität-graz.md,## 2. Usage rights
medizinische-universität-graz.md,"Med Uni Graz is entitled to exercise the unrestricted right to use data generated on behalf of or in the interest of Med Uni Graz for commercial and non-commercial purposes of exploitation with regard to all types of exploitation, including the right to edit these data, without any restrictions in terms of time and place. Section 106 (2) and (3) of the UG (Universities Act, in German: Universitätsgesetz) and the applicable provisions of the Patent Act (in German: Patentgesetz) apply to service inventions. The authors or inventors retain the legally reserved right to be named, the right to receive remuneration for service inventions, the right of university staff to independently publish scientific work and the right to be named as a (co-)author in the publication of research results."
medizinische-universität-graz.md,# MU Medizinische Universitat Graz
medizinische-universität-graz.md,"Insofar as the primary right to use the data is contractually granted to third legal entities (e.g. in the case of contract research agreements), it must be ensured that Med Uni Graz is in any case granted those rights of disposal over the data that are necessary to fulfil its data storage obligations to support good scientific practice. Furthermore, Med Uni Graz should be granted the right to use the results generated over the course of research activities for non-commercial research, teaching and, if possible, patient care."
medizinische-universität-graz.md,# MU Medizinische Universitat Graz
medizinische-universität-graz.md,"In order to comply with data protection regulations, the transfer of personal data to third parties is only permissible if the consent of a data clearing house is provided and with respect to legally compliant contractual agreements. The personal data to be reviewed should also include genetic and biometric data as well as data derived from biological material. The legality of the transfer of personal, pseudonymised, or anonymised data to third parties must be reviewed during the contractual review as part of the third-party funding process. If a data transfer is planned that is not regulated by a project contract, the research management must be informed in order to initiate a separate review, decision and, if necessary, contractual regulation process. The research management also represents the liaison to the Med Uni Graz data protection officer."
medizinische-universität-graz.md,"Where possible and appropriate, research data must be provided with a corresponding licence to use the work in order to enable the re-use of these data, provided that no third-party rights, legal obligations, or disposal rights conflict with this re-use. In any case, compliance with any specifications issued by funding agencies regarding the type of licence to be granted must be ensured."
medizinische-universität-graz.md,## 3. Handling research data
medizinische-universität-graz.md,### 3.1. Basic information
medizinische-universität-graz.md,"Research data and their metadata must be kept accurately, completely and reliably in accordance with good scientific practice to ensure the traceability of these data. Furthermore, efforts must be made to ensure the identifiability, findability, availability and, wherever possible, re-usability and interoperability of these data. If possible, the data should be given permanent identifiers."
medizinische-universität-graz.md,"Records need to be kept of the methodology used to obtain the data, their processing (such as corrections, calculations, transformations, statistical analyses) and quality control measures. These records are considered as part of the data and should be archived together with these (metadata)."
medizinische-universität-graz.md,"The retention period for research data and records is – unless other legal regulations apply - dated least ten years either from the date of publishing the research results or, if no publication takes place, from the date of completing the relevant research activity. Justified deviations may result from the legal regulations (e.g. patent law, pharmaceutical law, requirements for the documentation of patient care), the requirements of third-party funding providers, or specific guidelines issued by the Rectorate."
medizinische-universität-graz.md,"If research data and records are deleted or destroyed, this must be done in accordance with all legal and internal university requirements and in consideration of the aspect of traceability. The interests of other stakeholders (e.g. funding bodies) as well as aspects of confidentiality and security must be taken into account."
medizinische-universität-graz.md,"Research data management must be organised at each organisational unit to ensure that individual persons can find and access certain data but also to guarantee the findability and accessibility of the data, even in the absence of individual persons involved in the research process. In justified cases and in accordance with good scientific practice, it must be ensured that direct access (e.g. for managers, project leaders) or indirect access (e.g. for co-authors of joint manuscripts/publications, project partners, research-supporting institutions, authorities) can be granted to relevant original data. Such access may be necessary, e.g. to complete manuscripts or"
medizinische-universität-graz.md,# MU Medizinische Universitat Graz
medizinische-universität-graz.md,"to answer questions that arise (e.g. with regard to validation, traceability and quality assurance). In any case, it is recommended that data management plans be drawn up at the beginning of specific research projects and that these plans also be developed independently of the funding bodies’ specifications with regard to their research projects. Data management plans for funded research projects should be deposited in the Research Portal (in German: Forschungsportal). The use of external repositories must be indicated in the data management plan."
medizinische-universität-graz.md,"If third parties (e.g. funding bodies or journal editors) make requirements in this regard, research data must be stored and made accessible in a suitable repository, taking aspects of data protection into account."
medizinische-universität-graz.md,### 3.2. Handling personal data
medizinische-universität-graz.md,"During research activities at Med Uni Graz, personal data are also processed (e.g. data from patients, test persons and employees). Personal data are placed under special protection by data protection regulations. Therefore, they should be processed and used properly, taking due care in accordance with the legal provisions. When dealing with health data and other sensitive data, the increased requirements of the data protection regulations must be met."
medizinische-universität-graz.md,"Compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (in German: Datenschutzgrundverordnung, DSGVO), the Austrian Data Protection Act (in German: Datenschutzgesetz, DSG) and the Research Organisation Act (in German: Forschungsorganisationsgesetz, FOG) as well as any relevant Med Uni Graz guidelines (e.g. the guideline for data protection and IT security) must be ensured. This applies to the processing of electronic data as well as to information that is not processed through automation (e.g. on paper)."
medizinische-universität-graz.md,"## 4. Responsibilities, rights and duties"

mid-sweden-university.md,# Guidelines for research data management at Mid Sweden University
mid-sweden-university.md,## Subject matter
mid-sweden-university.md,"The aim of the guidelines is to describe and explain the different aspects and principles that researchers at Mid Sweden University have to consider when managing research data. The guidelines are a document that, through support and guidance, facilitates good and effective research data management, in line with the increased demands of different actors. The guidelines complement Mid Sweden University’s policy for research data management (DNR: MIUN 2020/1906). See also our web resource about research data for more information.1"
mid-sweden-university.md,### Definition of research data
mid-sweden-university.md,"Research data in this document refers to digital information that has been collected for analysis for a scientific purpose. Examples of research data are statistics and measurement data, transcribed interviews and survey responses, results from experiments, observations from fieldwork, recorded interviews (video/audio) and images."
mid-sweden-university.md,### Definition of metadata
mid-sweden-university.md,"Metadata is structured information used to describe and categorise digital information, i.e., “information/data about data”. There are different types of metadata: descriptive, administrative, or structural. Descriptive metadata can be, for example, title or author, administrative metadata can be file formats, licenses, and rights, while structural metadata may be, for example, a static link such as a Digital Object Identifier (DOI)."
mid-sweden-university.md,## FAIR principles
mid-sweden-university.md,"At EU and national level, there are requirements for publicly funded research to be made freely available. It includes both scientific publications and related research data. As a result, all research data funded in whole or in part from public funds shall be handled in accordance with the internationally accepted FAIR principles."
mid-sweden-university.md,"Managing research data according to the FAIR principles means making data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable. One benefit of managing data FAIR is that machine readability is considered. FAIR does not automatically mean that data should be made open access, but it should be described and made findable. FAIR data should be “as open as possible, as closed as necessary”."
mid-sweden-university.md,### Data Management Plans
mid-sweden-university.md,Mid Sweden University recommends a data management plan for research projects containing research data. Several research funders require data management plans for projects that have been granted funding.
mid-sweden-university.md,"A data management plan is a document that aims to describe in a structured way the management of research data in a project. The data management plan should cover all phases of the project from planning and collecting, creating, or generating data, to analysis, publishing and archiving. The plan makes it easier to keep track of your data during the project and can also make it easier to comply with the FAIR principles. In addition, the data management plan may facilitate the preparation of an ethical review application."
mid-sweden-university.md,"DMPonline is a tool for creating data management plans recommended by research funders, including the Swedish Research Council. Mid Sweden University advises researchers to use DMPonline to create data management plans and offer support, review of data management plans and guidance.2"
mid-sweden-university.md,## Research data in collaboration with others
mid-sweden-university.md,"The question of principality and who is responsible for research data can be complicated in collaborative research with other higher education institutions, organisations, private companies or healthcare."
mid-sweden-university.md,"When creating a data management plan, agreements should be established between the parties, which govern how the collaboration will work and how research data will be managed within the framework of the project. Agreements in that section may, for example, relate to who is responsible for which data, the handling of sensitive data or the costs associated with the data management."
mid-sweden-university.md,### Responsibility for research data
mid-sweden-university.md,"According to the definition in the Ethics Review Act (Act on Ethics Review of Human Research (SFS 2003:460)), research principal is a government agency or a natural or legal person in whose activities the research is carried out. It is the research principal who, together with the individual researcher, is legally responsible for ensuring that the activities comply with the rules of the Ethics Review Act. In addition to the responsibility for data management Mid Sweden University is a public authority with archival responsibility."
mid-sweden-university.md,Archiving legislation constitutes a mandatory legal framework and deals with issues relating to the preservation and deletion of documents at a public authority. It is also the higher education institution that assesses whether certain data should be disclosed upon request in accordance with the principle of public access to official records. Data protection legislation means additional responsibility for the higher education institution in the handling of research data containing personal data.
mid-sweden-university.md,"Research data collected at Mid Sweden University belongs, as a general rule, to the university and the university therefore has the principal responsibility for data."
mid-sweden-university.md,"There may be exceptions to the university´s property rights as a result of copyright rules. A document containing data relating to a work protected by copyright may nevertheless be subject to archiving liability, while at the same time subject to copyright protection. The university must consider copyright when applicable."
mid-sweden-university.md,## Research data and results
mid-sweden-university.md,"The Swedish “lärarundantaget” means that patentable inventions produced by university teachers are owned by the inventor. In addition, there are so-called “upphovsrättsliga lärarundantag”, which means that the teacher has the copyright in works produced in the service, such as publications and educational material. Mid Sweden University does not claim patent rights or any other intellectual property rights relating to the results of the research. The researcher is not expected to make research data available until the results of the research are published."
mid-sweden-university.md,"What is considered to be research data and research results should in most cases be clear. If questions arise regarding the demarcation between research data and research results, these issues should be addressed in consultation with Mid Sweden University’s support function DAU (Data Access Unit)."
mid-sweden-university.md,### Making research data accessible according to FAIR
mid-sweden-university.md,In what degree research data can be made open access or not is a case-bycase assessment. The assessment may be influenced by provisions in law and by research ethical considerations and carried out in consultation with the DAU function. Such an assessment is made before data have been collected and should be documented in a data management plan for each project.
mid-sweden-university.md,"A funder may require that research data be published openly available to grant applications for research funding, a funder may also have requested that data be treated confidentially. If such an agreement exists, data cannot be made open until any time embargo has expired. Such an agreement does not necessarily affect the possibility for someone to request data based on the principle of public access. In order to deny disclosure of a document or part of a document (data) upon request, the information must be protected by secrecy according in the Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act (SFS 2009:400)."
mid-sweden-university.md,"Data can be made accessible to varying degrees and still considered to be handled according to the FAIR principles. When data is confidential under the Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act, only metadata can be made available during the period of confidentiality. In other projects, aggregated data may be published openly, while raw data may only be released upon request. There are also projects where all data can and should be open access. It is possible to choose between different levels of accessibility for sharing data. The researcher, in consultation with the project leader, is responsible together with the DAU to indicate the appropriate level. Some examples of reasons why research data cannot be made open access are that it contains personal data, is subject to confidentiality under the Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act, is security protected or that there are ethical aspects that prevent open access to data."
mid-sweden-university.md,## Scientific Ethical Consents
mid-sweden-university.md,"When research data consists of data from persons participating in a research study, the individuals have normally given their consent for participation in the research. This consent is in some cases limited to the individual research study. Such limited consent constitutes an obstacle to open sharing. If the research participant has consented to the use of research data in other research, it may be made open provided that it does not contain confidential information. Such data may, for example, be sensitive personal data."
mid-sweden-university.md,### Research data as a public document
mid-sweden-university.md,"Research data within the University’s activities is archived and can then be requested by everyone as a public document. The right of access to official documents is restricted by secrecy. It is therefore the secrecy rules that limit what can be kept confidential if someone requests access to stored research data. The question whether or not to make research data open access is relevant for dissemination and re-use, but it does not affect the question whether research data is public or confidential."
mid-sweden-university.md,## Information security
mid-sweden-university.md,"Information security is about protecting information from various types of threats, such as transparency from unauthorised persons or distortion of information. In accordance with the FAIR principles, research data shall be as open as possible but as closed as necessary while protecting all data from leaking, distorting or destroying. A security system for data protection consists of three different parts: a technical, a physical and an organizational. The three parts shall complement each other and create a secure system."
mid-sweden-university.md,"Research data shall be handled in such a way as to ensure that the information is protected against unauthorised access (confidentiality), inaccurate changes (property), and that the information is accessible when needed (accessibility). It is also important to ensure that the information is not altered, sought, or disclosed to anyone who is not authorised to consult it."
mid-sweden-university.md,"Information classification is an important part of achieving good information security for your research data. The information classification is crucial for which storage space can be used for the management of research data. At Mid Sweden University there are guidelines for how information classification should be done, see Modell för klassificering av information DNR: MIUN 2020/2488."
mid-sweden-university.md,### Preservation and deletion of research data
mid-sweden-university.md,"Research data shall be preserved and archived for as long as possible, but in some cases, it may be allowed to delete data earlier. Current information and valid deletion decisions can be found on Mid Sweden University’s web."
mid-sweden-university.md,### Support function — DAU
mid-sweden-university.md,"Mid Sweden University has a support function called DAU (Data Access Unit) consisting of representatives from central parts of the administration. This function shall support and consult the university’s researchers in research data management, data management plans and open data. The support function can provide advice and recommendations on issues such as metadata registration, law, archiving, storage, and technical solutions. The DAU function is part of a national network where the majority of Swedish higher education institutions are under the direction of SND (Swedish National Data Service). The University Library has a coordinating and delegating role at Mid Sweden University. The support function can be reached at the following address: researchdata@miun.se"
middlesex-university.md,# Academic Policy Statement APs 27:
middlesex-university.md,# Research Data Management
middlesex-university.md,## 1. Introduction
middlesex-university.md,"Middlesex University is committed to supporting and facilitating research excellence. Excellent research is underpinned by high quality data and as such it is essential that research conducted within the institution be subject to Research Data Management (RDM) best practice. Supporting the principles of the Universities UK concordat to support research integrity' and the Middlesex University Code of Practice for Research,? it is the institution's responsibility to encourage and enable researchers to engage with this best practice."
middlesex-university.md,The benefits of managing research data effectively include:
middlesex-university.md,"Improving the integrity, longevity and utility of research data"
middlesex-university.md,Mitigating the risk of accidental data loss
middlesex-university.md,"Enabling data sharing and re-use, increasing the visibility, impact and integrity of research."
middlesex-university.md,Mitigating the risk of inappropriate release of sensitive data.
middlesex-university.md,Ensuring appropriate long term preservation of and access to data.
middlesex-university.md,"Research Councils UK (RcUK) expect that ""publicly funded research data are a public good, produced in the public interest, which should be made openly available with as few restrictions as possible in a timely and responsible manner that does not harm intellectual property [while recognising] that there are legal, ethical and commercial constraints on release of research data.""3"
middlesex-university.md,Individual funding councils such as Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPsRc)' and Economic and Social Research Council (EsRc)' have updated research data policy statements to set out responsibilities of both the individual researcher and research institutions. While other funders are not explicit in their expectations there is an implicit
middlesex-university.md,### understanding that researchers cannot meet expectations without support from their institution.
middlesex-university.md,## Definitions
middlesex-university.md,"Research Data Management can be described as ""..an explicit process covering the creation and stewardship of research materials to enable their use for as long as they retain value”6"
middlesex-university.md,"Research data can be defined as any digital object created during the course of research (which might include documents, still images, video and audio files, spreadsheets, software, computer code, databases or websites) in addition to physical objects such as sketchbooks, diaries, lab notebooks, portfolios, models or other artefacts. It also includes the documentation of Practice-as-Research."
middlesex-university.md,"Open Data is that which ""..can be freely used, modified, and shared by anyone for any purpose.”7"
middlesex-university.md,"Research data lifecycle can include the planning, creating, using, appraising, depositing, publishing and preservation of research data enabling both discovery and re-use."
middlesex-university.md,### This policy aims to:
middlesex-university.md,1. Raise awareness of RDM best practice and funder requirements and the associated implications for both individual researchers and the University
middlesex-university.md,2. Acknowledge that RDM falls within the remit of a range of stakeholders and that they will need to work together to develop a comprehensive and cohesive RDM infrastructure and support service.
middlesex-university.md,3. Delineate what Middlesex University expects of its researchers and clarify the services that will be provided to assist them.
middlesex-university.md,## 2. Researcher Responsibilities
middlesex-university.md,"As part of best practice, the University expects researchers to manage their data to appropriate standards throughout the research data lifecycle."
middlesex-university.md,2.1 All research proposals will include a Data Management Plan to be submitted with their grant application.
middlesex-university.md,"2.2 The senior researcher involved in a research project is ultimately responsible for the management of research data. In the case of research students, the supervisor is responsible."
middlesex-university.md,"2.3 Relevant ethics guidelines', intellectual property rights (including commercial implications),10 Copyright'1, and data protection12 must be considered."
middlesex-university.md,2.4 Appropriate data should be selected to preserve post-project for 10 years unless funder or legal requirements specify otherwise at which point a review process will be triggered.
middlesex-university.md,"2.5 Data selected for preservation must be registered in the institutional data catalogue within 12 months along with any associated restrictions and conditions of access. Appropriate metadata records should be included in the catalogue record, this should include reference to any disciplinary standards that have been applied to the data."
middlesex-university.md,2.5 The Dean of School is responsible for decision making about preserved datasets in the absence of a responsible individual.
middlesex-university.md,"2.6 Each researcher must make themselves familiar with and adhere to the requirements of their particular funder, publishers and other relevant stakeholders."
middlesex-university.md,"2.7 Research data should be made as open as possible unless there are legal, ethical, commercial, intellectual property or other reasons not to do so. An appropriate licence should be applied to manage the re-use of this data."
middlesex-university.md,## 3. Institutional Responsibilities
middlesex-university.md,"A programme of guidance and training in all areas of RDM for all relevant stakeholders will be developed by Library & Student Support (Lss) in consultation with all Schools, the Research & Knowledge Transfer Office (RKTO) and the Computing and Communications Systems Service (Ccss) and Staff Development."
middlesex-university.md,The University will develop infrastructure and support to enable compliance with this policy.

newcastle-university.md,# Newcastle University Research Data Management Policy Principles & Code of Good Practice
newcastle-university.md,This document outlines the overall policy of the University and its expectations of its staff and key services. More detailed practical help and information can be found on the ‘Research Data oolkit’ website:
newcastle-university.md,"olicy Principles 1. The project Principal Investigator (PI) at Newcastle University has overall responsibility for the appropriate storage, treatment (including making data sets suitable for publication) and security of research project data. PIs may delegate discrete responsibilities to other members of the project team and this should be recorded. 2. All research projects are encouraged to create a data management plan at the earliest practical stage of a project. The plan should outline a project’s approach to data, including costs and be reviewed regularly to ensure that practice remains in-line with expected standards. 3. All University staff are responsible for making themselves familiar with and adhering to legislation, funder guidance and University policy governing their research data. 4. The University expects that data (particularly personal data) be protected in line with both external and internal standards and discipline specific practice. The PI has responsibility for ensuring the safeguarding of personal identifiable research data and compliance with all relevant legal requirements. 5. Researchers should deposit all significant archive research data in an appropriate funder mandated or discipline specific data repository. Where this is not available, data should be deposited in an approved centre / manner. 6. Published datasets should be comprehensive and have clear instructions for access, which adheres to data citation principles. Metadata (descriptive information) should be rich enough to facilitate discovery, reproduction and reuse. Personal data should be protected in line with the University’s Ethics Policy and Code of Good Practice. 7. Research data should remain available for 10 years following any publication (unless otherwise specified) after which retention will be reviewed. Metadata will be kept indefinitely. 8. Non-digital data or digital data that underpins a publication should be recorded in the University’s data catalogue as a metadata record. 9. The University undertakes to provide appropriate resources, training, support and guidance to researchers and research support staff around data management and data governance. Where appropriate, the University will also provide a mechanism to record research metadata and to manage access. 10. Where research data has a commercial value or supports a commercial output such as a patent then public disclosure of the data may be delayed (this should be agreed in consultation with Research Strategy and Development)."
newcastle-university.md,## Code of Good Practice in Research Data Management
newcastle-university.md,### 1. Background & Purpose
newcastle-university.md,"The Policy Principles and Code of Good Practice have been written to guide researchers towards the best practice in the area of research data management. The document brings together guidance from across the institution and is designed as a single point of reference for academic and support staff. A research data management digital toolkit has been created to provide up-to-date links to related policies, funder requirements and best practice guidance. Collectively the policy principles, code of good practice and toolkit aim to:"
newcastle-university.md,support good research data management practice
newcastle-university.md,ensure that data is handled appropriately
newcastle-university.md,maximise impact of open data by encouraging discoverability and reuse
newcastle-university.md,ensure compliance with legislation and funder polices
newcastle-university.md,protect sensitive / personally identifiable data
newcastle-university.md,protect intellectual property and commercialisation opportunities
newcastle-university.md,The document sets out the best practice standards the institution expects of projects which it sponsors or which are undertaken in its name. It does not replace or override guidance from research funders; it should instead be considered as a complementary resource. If there are multiple guidelines then the most rigorous advice should be followed and / or advice sought from the Research Data Service (RDS).
newcastle-university.md,### 2. Scope
newcastle-university.md,The Policy and Code of Good Practice covers all funded research projects undertaken by Newcastle University staff and postgraduate researchers. The policy applies to all data (including active and archive data) regardless of format and relates to projects active at / from the time of policy approval.
newcastle-university.md,The University acknowledges that a full implementation of this policy will be a long-term process.
newcastle-university.md,### 3. Responsible Personnel / Bodies
newcastle-university.md,"Research Active Staff, Research Active Postgraduates, Research Data Service, Research Strategy and Development (including Legal & Joint Research Office), Library, IT Service, Head of Academic Units, University Research Committee, PIs, and Project Team Members."
newcastle-university.md,#### 3.1. Overall
newcastle-university.md,"University Research Committee (URC) has overall responsibility for the institution’s research data strategy, its implementation and support. URC devolves responsibility for individual research projects to the project PI; however it recognises that for the PI to effectively perform their responsibilities they must be supported by other academic staff, academic units and the central services."
newcastle-university.md,"Responsibility for the implementation, operation and support of the policy as well as compliance to it is devolved to the Research Data Service (RDS). The RDS is also responsible for reviewing the policy and ensuring it remains suitable for the requirements of the institution, funders and data providers."
newcastle-university.md,#### 3.2. Principal Investigators
newcastle-university.md,Practical and operational responsibility for research data throughout the lifecycle of the project is in the hands of the project PI at Newcastle. Their key responsibilities are:
newcastle-university.md,"ensuring data collection, storage, processing and dissemination are in line with legal and funder requirements"
newcastle-university.md,ensuring project research data management maps to best practice in their research field
newcastle-university.md,delegating responsibility for research data management to other members of the project team e.g. to co-investigators or project administrators

newcastle-university.md,Research Strategy and Development
newcastle-university.md,### 4. Ownership of Data
newcastle-university.md,"Research data may have significant ethical, confidentiality, intellectual property, funder and legal restrictions attached to it and therefore ownership of the data should be established as early as possible. An appropriate agreement should be in place before the project starts. The Research Data Service will be able to advise and, where necessary, negotiate with funders on behalf of PIs."
newcastle-university.md,"Unless explicitly agreed the University owns the intellectual property rights, including copyright, to the research data created by researchers during the term of their employment with the University. Where research is externally funded this may create additional obligations and this should be taken into account."
newcastle-university.md,"Postgraduate research students will ordinarily own the intellectual property rights, including copyright, to the research data created during their studies. Exceptions exist where they are working on a funded project – please see the Research Student Confidentiality and IP Policy for further clarification. Nevertheless as the research sponsor the University requires that research students follow this policy, including the good data management and reuse aspects."
newcastle-university.md,### 5. Use of Third Party Data
newcastle-university.md,"Where research involves usage of third party data, any terms and conditions associated with the data should be carefully scrutinised for potential copyright and / or licensing issues. These may have an impact on what data can be used for in the future. It is also important to ensure the data does not have any ethical restrictions associated with it e.g. it relates to nonanonymised personal identifiable data as this may affect the conditions of reuse."
newcastle-university.md,### 6. Third Party Usage of University Data
newcastle-university.md,Any data released for reuse should have a licence associated with its usage. This licence will ensure (at minimum) that the University and Academic Creator(s) are attributed in any reuse of the data. The University will provide standard agreements which should be signed before data is shared. Access will be arranged through the Research Data Service.
newcastle-university.md,"Once data has been made available to the public, it should be noted that the data will then be available for further reuse. Therefore, the PI should ensure that the data is released at an appropriate point i.e. when opportunities for commercialisation and publication have been explored."
newcastle-university.md,### 7. Sharing Data with Project Partners
newcastle-university.md,A clear agreement regarding research data management and sharing should be put in place before any project start date. Special care should be taken where the project involves organisations outside the European Economic Area which may be governed by less robust legal frameworks and present a greater risk of unintended dissemination. Likewise when working with commercial organisations the increased intellectual property considerations should be taken into account when agreeing data sharing and publication. Research Strategy and Development will be able to assist in drawing up an appropriate agreement.
newcastle-university.md,"Details of data sharing; type, frequency, format and transfer arrangements should be noted within your data management plan and agreed at the project outset."
newcastle-university.md,Links to Legal and Grants & Contracts
newcastle-university.md,### 8. Commercialisation
newcastle-university.md,"Where research data has, or may have, commercial value, Research Strategy and Development should be consulted at the earliest possible stage. They will assist in assessing the value of the data, provide advice on the exploitation of any opportunities and whether publication of the data should be delayed or access restricted."
newcastle-university.md,Link to Research Strategy and Development Policies and Enterprise Teams
newcastle-university.md,### 9. Active Storage & Data Security
newcastle-university.md,Each project should create and maintain a data management plan that details all key information on the project. For advice on this please see the additional resources.
newcastle-university.md,"Given the faculty based structure of the University, academic units are responsible for ensuring staff are aware of available options and use storage facilities that provide the required standards for their data. The Research Data Service will provide this information to the faculties."
newcastle-university.md,"Funded projects receive a data allowance of 0.5TB. Where project data needs are greater than this figure and funder requirements allow, additional resource should be costed into the project at the grant application stage."
newcastle-university.md,For requirements outside of this please consult the Research Data Service (RDS) or the Institute IT Support Officer.
newcastle-university.md,#### 9.1. Digital Research Data
newcastle-university.md,"Wherever possible and appropriate data should be stored in digital format using approved storage systems. Data should be stored in a secure location, in a robust format, backed up"
newcastle-university.md,"regularly and access to data should be controlled to protect against theft, misuse, damage or loss. Data should be stored according to best practice in the relevant field of research."
newcastle-university.md,The IT Service provides a secure storage service; of which all staff receive a basic allowance and more can be requested although this may incur an additional cost. The IT Service can also provide guidance and advice on other external providers of data storage.
newcastle-university.md,For information and guidance on the storage of digital data please see the IT Service (NUIT) and Governance web pages.
newcastle-university.md,#### 9.2. Non-digital Research Data
newcastle-university.md,Wherever possible and appropriate non-digital research data should be digitised. If they cannot be digitised they should be stored securely in line with discipline best practice and digital metadata (information of data location and access conditions) provided at publication / project end.
newcastle-university.md,### 10. Storage at Project End / Data Retention
newcastle-university.md,"The University mandates that the project data underpinning publications and data with acknowledged long-term value should remain accessible, and where appropriate discoverable, for at least 10 years."
newcastle-university.md,#### 10.1. Archiving
newcastle-university.md,"The responsibility for the archiving of the data lies with the PI and there are numerous national and data specific repositories. The PI should check that the sharing of the data is permissible and appropriate in light of confidentiality, ethical and legal concerns before depositing any data into a repository and making the data openly available."
newcastle-university.md,#### 10.2 Registration of Archived Data with the University
newcastle-university.md,The University requires that the location of the data underpinning any publication be made available to the RDS (on request) if the funder requires or if the data is identified as being reusable.
newcastle-university.md,### 11. Deletion
newcastle-university.md,The University requires that the data is kept 10 years from the last date of access. After this point the data will be reviewed and either retained or destroyed. Any destruction will be in accordance with legal and funder requirements.
newcastle-university.md,### 12.  Breach(es)
newcastle-university.md,"Where a breach of this Policy and Code of Good Practice results in the unauthorised release of identifiable personal information into the public domain or non-compliance with external funder or regulatory requirements, this should be reported to the Research Data Service at the earliest possible time. If you are unsure whether a breach should be reported please contact the relevant Faculty Dean of Research Innovation."
newcastle-university.md,"The Research Data Service will then work with the Principle Investigator and project team to minimise any potential damage and to ensure that all relevant parties including participants, data providers and funders are appropriately advised."

newcastle-university.md,## Appendix A
newcastle-university.md,### Security-sensitive Research Material
newcastle-university.md,Security-sensitive materials in this case can be defined as:- a) Those which are covered by the Official Secrets Act (1989) and the Terrorism Act 2006. b) Materials which could be considered ‘extremist’ or incompatible with British values.
newcastle-university.md,The University supports both its academic faculty and student body in undertaking research utilising security sensitive materials but takes seriously its responsibility to protect them both from the potentially radicalising effects of viewing materials of this type and of misinterpretation of intent by authorities (which may result in legal sanction).
newcastle-university.md,To ensure the University is able to protect its researchers it must be aware of the research before it begins. Early notification is through the ethical review process; it is from this that the institution is able to ensure proper data governance and oversight.
newcastle-university.md,### Ethical Review
newcastle-university.md,"The University is clear that research involving the access, collection and use of securitysensitive materials carries a risk to researchers as well as the general public and therefore any such research should go through full ethical review."
newcastle-university.md,"The University operates a two stage ethical review process for all its research. Within the preliminary stage, section six relates to data. The researcher should answer ‘Yes’ to the question."
newcastle-university.md,"1. Does the research involve the viewing, usage or transfer of Sensitive personal data as defined as by the Data Protection Act 1998, Terrorism Act (2006) or data governed by statute such as the Official Secrets Act, commercial contract or by convention e.g. client confidentiality? (If you are unsure please tick ‘Yes’ and complete the sub-questions)."
newcastle-university.md,Then answer ‘Yes’ to the relevant sub-question(s).
newcastle-university.md,The researcher will then be directed to the full ethical review form where they will be asked to provide additional information on the types of data being used and materials accessed.
newcastle-university.md,### Data Governance
newcastle-university.md,The downloading of (particularly terrorism related) security-sensitive materials and visiting of security-sensitive websites can be seen by the authorities as prosecutable offences should the intent behind them be illegal.
newcastle-university.md,"Research material which is security sensitive should not be kept on the researcher’s personal computer or on their standard University drive. Before beginning the research, a member of NUITs Information Security Team should be contacted, they will arrange for the set-up of an appropriately secure project drive. Material within this drive will be easy to access but in some cases there will may restrictions preventing its exchange."
newcastle-university.md,"Likewise if the research involves visiting security-sensitive websites, the researcher should be aware that many of these sites are under surveillance by the authorities. It is strongly recommended that their University profile (IP address) is used to access these sites, thereby ensuring that their activities are flagged as being a legitimate part of their research and ensure that enquiries come to the institution in the first instance."
newcastle-university.md,"Physical data, e.g. manuals / reports should be scanned and a copy uploaded to the secure project file store."
newcastle-university.md,"By using a secure file store (along with appropriate ethics approval) the researcher will ensure that, should the University be asked, it can confirm that the materials within it are for research. Please be aware that in order to effectively answer any queries from the security services the Research Strategy and Development will be able to access metadata on the files e.g. titles and date of creation within the secure project drive. It will not however be able to access the content."
newcastle-university.md,### Oversight
newcastle-university.md,The university also has a responsibility to ensure that researchers are not adversely affected (emotionally and intellectually) by the research they undertake. If there are any concerns these should be raised as soon as possible.
newcastle-university.md,Student projects: In the first instance it is the project supervisor’s responsibility to ensure that the students are not adversely affected. Supervisors should be prepared to liaise closely with the student’s personal tutor and student welfare.
newcastle-university.md,Staff projects: The Head of Unit will handle any concerns in consultation with Human Resources.
newcastle-university.md,### External Queries
newcastle-university.md,Any queries from legitimate bodies e.g. the police or security services will be handled by the Research Strategy and Development in conjunction with the Information Security Team. If an individual receives an inquiry from the Police then the University’s Research Strategy and Development tram should be advised of this.
newcastle-university.md,The email contact for this and any other enquiries is res.policy@ncl.ac.uk
northumbria-university-at-newcastle.md,# Research Data Management Policy
northumbria-university-at-newcastle.md,## 1 Introduction/Context
northumbria-university-at-newcastle.md,"The effective management of research data is becoming increasingly important.  UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) has affirmed that making research data available to users is a core part of its remit.  UKRI’s Common Principles on Data Policy1 states that ‘Publicly funded research data are a public good, produced in the public interest, which should be made openly available with as few restrictions as possible in a timely and responsible manner that does not harm intellectual property.’"
northumbria-university-at-newcastle.md,"Northumbria University recognises that data from its research should be wellmanaged to benefit the researcher, the University and the wider community.  As such, there is an obligation to record, store and archive research data appropriately, in a way that is proportionate in terms of security and retention, and allows for sharing of data to contribute to the impact of the research.  It is recognised that types of data used, collected and generated will vary between different disciplines. The approach taken in this policy is to be sensitive to these differences while ensuring that good practice is promoted and funder requirements are met."
northumbria-university-at-newcastle.md,"This policy should be read in conjunction with other University policies, notably the Records Management Policy2, the Research Ethics and Governance Handbook3, and the Data Protection Policy4."
northumbria-university-at-newcastle.md,## 2 Scope
northumbria-university-at-newcastle.md,"The policy applies to all research conducted by staff and postgraduate research students at the University, regardless of whether it is funded or unfunded.  The policy does not normally apply to activities such as surveys used to improve service provision, conducted by Students’ Union or Service Departments, or to undergraduate work, unless it is included in scholarly publications."
northumbria-university-at-newcastle.md,### 3 Definition of Research
northumbria-university-at-newcastle.md,"Research in the context of this policy is based on the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) Research Excellence Framework (REF) 2014 definition, contained in Annex C of the ‘Assessment Framework and Guidance on Submissions’5, which defines research as ‘a process of investigation leading to new insights, effectively shared.’  It includes work of direct relevance to the needs of commerce, industry, and to the public and voluntary sectors; scholarship; the invention and generation of ideas, images, performances, artefacts including design, where these lead to new or substantially improved insights; and the use of existing knowledge in experimental development to produce new or substantially improved materials, devices, products and processes, including design and construction. It excludes routine testing and routine analysis of materials, components and processes such as for the maintenance of national standards, as distinct from the development of new analytical techniques. It also excludes the development of teaching materials that do not embody original research."
northumbria-university-at-newcastle.md,### 4 Definition of Research Data
northumbria-university-at-newcastle.md,"For the purposes of this policy, research data refers to any material collected, observed or created for the purpose of analysis and on which research conclusions are based.  Research data may be numerical, descriptive or visual, and can be digital, paper-based or in other forms."
northumbria-university-at-newcastle.md,### 5 Definition of Researcher
northumbria-university-at-newcastle.md,"For the purposes of this policy, researchers are defined as members of the University, including all staff and postgraduate research (PGR) students, and those conducting research on University premises or using University facilities."
northumbria-university-at-newcastle.md,"The policy excludes Postgraduate Taught and Undergraduate students, unless their research findings are included in scholarly publications."
northumbria-university-at-newcastle.md,## 6 Governance
northumbria-university-at-newcastle.md,"i) The policy is approved by Research and Knowledge Exchange Committee, and monitored through the Research Data Management Working Group. ii) The policy will be reviewed annually."
northumbria-university-at-newcastle.md,## 7 Principles
northumbria-university-at-newcastle.md,"The principles which underpin the use and management of research data by University staff and students are set out below. These principles are consistent with the principles of data protection set out in Article 5 of the General Data Protection Regulation6 and satisfy the requirements in Schedule 1, Part 4, 39 of the UK Data Protection Act 2018:"
northumbria-university-at-newcastle.md,"i) Research data will be managed throughout the research data lifecycle7 in accordance with the University’s policies, guidelines and standards, and funder, legislative and ethical requirements."
northumbria-university-at-newcastle.md,"ii) Research data shall in most cases be collected for the purposes of creating new knowledge which is shared with others through publication and dissemination. In these cases, research is normally deemed to be ‘a task in the public interest’ (principles of lawfulness and purpose limitation Art.6 GDPR). In cases where special category data are being processed, then an additional condition will apply. For most research carried out by the University"
northumbria-university-at-newcastle.md,this will normally be that processing is necessary for ‘scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes’ (GDPR Art.9).
northumbria-university-at-newcastle.md,"iii) Data management plans should be written for all new research projects, regardless of whether submission of such plans is required when applying for research funding.  The plan must address how the data will be captured, managed, stored, retained, shared, published, and how any confidentiality and data protection issues will be addressed.8 See also Section 10 for further guidance on data management plans."
northumbria-university-at-newcastle.md,"iv) Personally identifiable data should be anonymised or pseudonymised where possible as soon after collection as possible. Where researchers can undertake some or all of their research activities without using identifiable personal data, they should make arrangements to do so (principle of data minimisation). Where research requires the processing of personal data, and where the University is the data controller, then there must be a clear legal basis for processing and this must be communicated to the data subject (principle of lawfulness, fairness and transparency).9"
northumbria-university-at-newcastle.md,v) Where personal data are stored and processed for research purposes by University staff this must be carried out in accordance with the University’s information security policy (principle of integrity and confidentiality).10
northumbria-university-at-newcastle.md,"vi) Data should be made available for access and re-use where legally, ethically and commercially appropriate."
northumbria-university-at-newcastle.md,"vii) Researchers must provide sufficient metadata and explanatory documentation about their research data to ensure that data are discoverable, understandable and re-useable.  Such metadata will be published by the University, normally within 12 months of the data being generated.  If access to data is restricted, the metadata should outline the reasons for this and the conditions which need to be met for access to be granted."
northumbria-university-at-newcastle.md,"viii) Data must be retained in an appropriate format for a period of at least 1 year from the end of the project for low risk projects, 3 years for moderate risk projects and 7 years for high risk projects, in accordance with the University’s Research Records Retention Schedule (principle of storage limitation)11, unless other funder regulations apply (for example, EPSRC stipulates a retention period of 10 years, plus an additional 10 from the last date at which access to the data was requested by a third party).  Where possible and applicable, research data that are not in a digital format will be digitised to facilitate access."
northumbria-university-at-newcastle.md,"ix) Where possible, or if mandated by the funder, retained data must be submitted to an appropriate archive or database for long-term preservation."
northumbria-university-at-newcastle.md,"Researchers should avoid retaining data using methods that might not persist for 10 years, such as project websites."
northumbria-university-at-newcastle.md,"x) All data which are created as part of research at Northumbria University must be registered with the University, even if the data are hosted elsewhere.  All reasonable steps must be taken to ensure that research data are not stored in a jurisdiction that offers lower levels of protection than are available in the UK."
northumbria-university-at-newcastle.md,"xi) Published papers should include a statement describing how, and on what terms, supporting research data may be accessed."
northumbria-university-at-newcastle.md,## 8 Data Management Responsibilities
northumbria-university-at-newcastle.md,i) The most senior Northumbria researcher associated with a research project (whether funded or unfunded) is the Data Lead for that project and is ultimately responsible and accountable for research data management within that project.
northumbria-university-at-newcastle.md,"ii) For funded projects, the Data Lead will normally be the Principal Investigator."
northumbria-university-at-newcastle.md,"iii) For Postgraduate Research Students, the Data Lead will normally be the Principal Supervisor."
northumbria-university-at-newcastle.md,"iv) The Data Lead is responsible for ensuring that all research staff and students working on a project are aware of the University’s data management policy and supporting guidelines and procedures, and for reviewing data management plans annually.  The Data Lead may assign specific data management responsibilities to other researchers on a project."
northumbria-university-at-newcastle.md,"v) In the absence of the Data Lead, responsibility for research data management devolves to the department Research and Innovation Lead."
northumbria-university-at-newcastle.md,vi) Stakeholders and Services across the University will work together to create a robust infrastructure for the research data lifecycle.
northumbria-university-at-newcastle.md,## 9 Implementation and Communication
northumbria-university-at-newcastle.md,"i) The University will provide training, support, advice and guidance regarding research data management through the researcher development training programme (including the PGR training programme) and web-based guidance."
northumbria-university-at-newcastle.md,"ii) The University will provide mechanisms and services for storage, backup, registration and retention of research data during a research project and after its completion."

queen-margaret-university-edinburgh.md,"Data Management plans must be prepared according to funders’ requirements, or elsewhere directed."
queen-margaret-university-edinburgh.md,"Heads of Research have overall responsibility for the effective management of research data generated within or obtained during research activities research, including by their research groups.  However, it is expected that in most cases the PI of a project will be responsible for developing a DMP."
queen-margaret-university-edinburgh.md,All new Data Management Plans should include processes for:
queen-margaret-university-edinburgh.md,"Data capture,"
queen-margaret-university-edinburgh.md,"Management,"
queen-margaret-university-edinburgh.md,"Integrity,"
queen-margaret-university-edinburgh.md,"Confidentiality,"
queen-margaret-university-edinburgh.md,"Retention,"
queen-margaret-university-edinburgh.md,Sharing and publication.

queen-margaret-university-edinburgh.md,### Data Management Principles
queen-margaret-university-edinburgh.md,Research data must be retained and disposed of securely according to the relevant retention and disposal schedule.  This can be found at:
queen-margaret-university-edinburgh.md,Records Retention Policy
queen-margaret-university-edinburgh.md,"7.2 Research data that underpins published results or is considered to have long-term value should be retained.  The default period for research data retention is 10 years from date of last requested access. However, retention periods should, as a minimum, conform to the requirements of a funding agency or body."
queen-margaret-university-edinburgh.md,"7.3 Retained data must be deposited in an appropriate data service, or as mandated by the funder or otherwise directed."
queen-margaret-university-edinburgh.md,A statement describing how and on what terms any supporting data may be accessed must be included in research outputs.
queen-margaret-university-edinburgh.md,"7.5 Where research is undertaken in partnership or under contract with a third party, a collaboration agreement must be signed before the start of the research that clearly addresses data ownership and partner responsibility for data storage."
queen-margaret-university-edinburgh.md,7.6 Data placed on temporary storage must be transferred back onto the approved storage platform as detailed in the DMP as soon as the requirement for temporary storage has ended.
queen-margaret-university-edinburgh.md,7.7 Research proposals should consider whether storage requirements may exceed those currently offered by the University.  Any such potential requirement should be discussed in advance of the application with both IT and the RDM Working Group.
queen-margaret-university-edinburgh.md,"7.8 Before staff leave the university, data of long-term value produced using University resources must remain accessible to the University.  Ownership of the data should be transferred to another member of staff on agreement of the Head of Division."
queen-margaret-university-edinburgh.md,"7.9 At the completion of a project, the PI must assess what data are of long-term value, and whether the data can be made openly available in a manner consistent with relevant legal, ethical and regulatory frameworks."
queen-margaret-university-edinburgh.md,"7.10 If research data are to be deleted or destroyed, this should be done in accordance with all legal, ethical and funder requirements and only after the written approval of the Head of Division."
queen-margaret-university-edinburgh.md,"7.11 Retained data suitable for external access should be stored on QMU's institutional data repository, eData unless an alternative is mandated by the funder."
queen-margaret-university-edinburgh.md,"Library Services manages QMU's open-access data repository, eData.  It exists to preserve datasets that support research outputs published by QMU researchers, as required by funder or publisher mandates, and to maximise their sharing and reuse."
queen-margaret-university-edinburgh.md,Datasets shared in eData should be used in accordance with the Terms in the QMU
queen-margaret-university-edinburgh.md,Repositories Policy.
queen-margaret-university-edinburgh.md,"7.12 After a project, a metadata record describing retained data must be made publicly available within 12 months of the project completion."
queen-margaret-university-edinburgh.md,"7.13 Metadata and documentation about research data should provide sufficient contextual information to enable the data to be discovered, accessed, understood, interpreted and reused by future users."
queen-margaret-university-edinburgh.md,"7.14 If access to the data is restricted, the published metadata should provide the reasons for the restrictions and summarise the conditions that must be satisfied for access to be granted."
queen-margaret-university-edinburgh.md,"7.15 All users of research datasets should acknowledge the sources of their data and abide by the terms and conditions under which they were accessed, in order to recognise the intellectual contributions of research teams and supporting organisations."
queen-margaret-university-edinburgh.md,7.16 Research data must be managed throughout its lifecycle in compliance with relevant legislation.
queen-margaret-university-edinburgh.md,"7.17 Unless there are ethically and legally justified reasons for doing otherwise, researchers working with human subjects must ensure that they have an auditable record of each study participant’s explicit informed consent. to obtain, hold and use their personal data as per research ethics guidance."
queen-margaret-university-edinburgh.md,8 Cloud Storage
queen-margaret-university-edinburgh.md,"8.1 For the purposes of this policy, ‘Cloud’ storage refers to third party web-based data storage such as Microsoft OneDrive, Google Drive, Dropbox etc."

queen-margaret-university-edinburgh.md,## 9 Compliance
queen-margaret-university-edinburgh.md,Wilful failure to comply with this policy will be treated extremely seriously by the University and may result in disciplinary action.  Failure to comply may also result in withdrawal of research funding.
queen-mary-university-of-london.md,# Research Data Access and Management Policy
queen-mary-university-of-london.md,## 1  Background
queen-mary-university-of-london.md,"A 2008 HEFCE-funded report defines research data as “the evidence base on which academic researchers build their analytic or other work.” Data management, including planning for long-term storage and sharing, is an increasingly important aspect of the UK Research funding environment. Most grant applications for research which will generate digital data sets require a data management plan that meets the 2011 Research Councils UK (RCUK) policy; this states that: ‘Publicly funded research data are a public good, produced in the public interest, which should be made openly available with as few restrictions as possible in a timely and responsible manner that does not harm intellectual property:’"
queen-mary-university-of-london.md,"As of May 2012, RCUK required all funded universities to have a data management policy and road map in place, that will be fully implemented by 2015 to meet their expectations for data sharing, as follows:"
queen-mary-university-of-london.md,publicly funded research data should be made openly available in a timely manner;
queen-mary-university-of-london.md,data with acknowledged long term value should be made accessible;
queen-mary-university-of-london.md,"RCUK recognises that there are legal, ethical and commercial constraints on release of research data. To ensure that the research process is not damaged by inappropriate release of data, research organisation policies and practices should ensure that these are considered at all stages in the research process;"
queen-mary-university-of-london.md,Research Council funded work may be entitled to a limited period of privileged use of the data.
queen-mary-university-of-london.md,A summary of funder data management/sharing requirements can be found here:
queen-mary-university-of-london.md,## 2  Guidelines for researchers on Open Data
queen-mary-university-of-london.md,"1. In general, access to the data underlying research has a range of advantages - it promotes the progress of research as a whole, allows for the validation and reproduction of research findings, and enables the efficient and costeffective creation of additional social and economic value."
queen-mary-university-of-london.md,"2. Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) is committed to the general principle of open access (OA) to research, and the data underlying such research, subject to the necessary constraints of any funder, legal and ethical requirements, and following QMUL policies, guidelines and standards. For OA please see the QMUL Guidelines on Open Access, and for research data, please see the Research Data Access and Management Policy below."
queen-mary-university-of-london.md,"3. The process of fully implementing appropriate repositories and resources for implementing OA to research data within QMUL will take a number of years, and it is expected that researchers will gradually increase the use of such resources over such a period."
queen-mary-university-of-london.md,"4. Data identified for open access will be offered for deposit either in a QMUL or an appropriate external repository, in accordance with relevant standards and community best practice, which may be determined by the area of research activity."
queen-mary-university-of-london.md,5. Links to repositories and descriptions of the means of access are expected to be made via the QMUL Publists system as this evolves.
queen-mary-university-of-london.md,"6. The Research Data Management Group will set up and manage the necessary resources for the implementation of the research data access and management policy, and will be issuing further guidance as this project continues."

queen-mary-university-of-london.md,# 3  Research Data Access and Management Policy
queen-mary-university-of-london.md,"1. Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) is committed to the general principle of Open Access to research, including to research datai within the necessary constraints of any funder, legal and ethical requirements, and following QMUL policies, guidelines and standards."
queen-mary-university-of-london.md,"2. Due to the particular concerns around access to medical-related data, access to data that is associated with medical research will be governed by the relevant funder’s policies on datasharing. If a funder does not have such a policy, then the MRC’s policy on data-sharing should be the default policy ii"
queen-mary-university-of-london.md,"3. Where reasonably practicable, publicly funded research data should be made available for access, subject to such conditions as are necessary to ensure compliance with legal, data protection, ethical, confidentiality, IP protection, security or funder obligations."
queen-mary-university-of-london.md,"4. Data identified for open access will be offered for deposit either in a QMUL or an appropriate external repository, in accordance with relevant standards and community best practice, which may be determined by the area of research activity."
queen-mary-university-of-london.md,5. Data must be retained intact in an appropriate format and storage facility according to funder requirements and consonant with any data management plans approved as part of any funding.
queen-mary-university-of-london.md,6. The rights of researchers to the exclusive use of research data that they generate as part of a well-defined research project will be protected up until the point of publication or public availability.
queen-mary-university-of-london.md,"7. Where data is made available on request rather than via straightforward open access the rationale for this must be made public, and such availability should not be unreasonably withheld."
queen-mary-university-of-london.md,"8. Data arising from research involving human subjects can only be made accessible if those subjects give their informed consent in advance in writing for the future public release of their data, with clear and study- specific explanations of how the data will be anonymised so that it will not be possible for those in receipt of the data to identify any individuals. Where it has been determined that it would be inappropriate to make such data accessible, for example because it might lead to identification of research subjects or because seeking consent would make it unlikely that subjects would participate in the research, then the data will remain confidential."
queen-mary-university-of-london.md,"9. For research collaborations, any open access arrangements can only take place with the agreement of all research partners."
queen-mary-university-of-london.md,"10. Where retention is not specified as a condition of funding, data storage and disposal will be determined by the nature of the research activity and would normally be retained for a period of at least 10 years for non clinical and at least 20 years for all clinical based activities from the date of any publication which is based upon it, as specified in the QMUL Records Retention schedule."
queen-mary-university-of-london.md,"11. Protocols for research in which data will be generated or reused should include data management plans that explicitly address data capture, management, integrity, confidentiality, retention, sharing and publication. These plans will be retained by QMUL to guide future management of the data."
queen-mary-university-of-london.md,"12. The Principal Investigator, or most senior QMUL researcher, in a research project, has responsibility for ensuring that research data management requirements are observed during a research project or programme that they are undertaking."
queen-mary-university-of-london.md,13. Those responsible for research staff and students should ensure that researchers in their areas are aware of this policy and any associated guidelines and procedures.
queen-mary-university-of-london.md,"14. All researchers are expected to familiarise themselves with and act in accordance with this and other QMUL policies relating to research practice. This information will be made accessible from the QMUL research webpages, both external and internal."
queen-mary-university-of-london.md,"15. QMUL will provide advice, training and support regarding research data management."
queen-mary-university-of-london.md,16. The Research Data Management Group will set up and manage the necessary resources for the implementation of this policy.
queen-mary-university-of-london.md,17. Any queries on the application of this policy should be directed to the VicePrincipal (Research).
queen-mary-university-of-london.md,"18. Appeals against the withholding of data may be made in writing to the VicePrincipal (Research), who will review the case from the researcher or their representative for withholding data, and the appeal case, in the light of this policy and other relevant policies, and make a final decision."
qutech.md,# QuTech Research Data Management Policy
qutech.md,# QuTech Research Data Management Policy
qutech.md,## Preface
qutech.md,"The QuTech Research Data Management Policy is part of the central TU Delft Research Data Framework Policy (which outlines the roles of the Library, ICT Department, University Services and the Executive Board at TU Delft).1 This policy helps create effective practices for working with research data at the research institute, and defines data management roles and responsibilities of the different stakeholders within QuTech from the 1st of April 2022 onwards."
qutech.md,"The principles outlined in this policy are elaborated in more detail, with supporting information available in the online guidance."
qutech.md,"This policy is motivated by the belief that good data management is an essential research skill, leads to research that is more time- and cost-efficient as it prevents data and information loss and duplication of efforts and is required to guarantee the quality, reproducibility and impact of research. This policy is inspired by the FAIR principles: research data should be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) by archiving the data with proper documentation."
qutech.md,This policy cultivates:
qutech.md,Best practice for ensuring that scientific arguments and results are reproducible in the long term.
qutech.md,Better exposure of academic work of researchers at QuTech and TU Delft leading to recognition of the quality of the research process.
qutech.md,"Responsible management of research data, including the protection of intellectual property rights and export control of data"
qutech.md,Improved practices for meeting the demands of funders and publishers with respect to research data management and sharing.
qutech.md,Long term preservation of the data underlying publications for future researchers within and outside the research group. This cannot be guaranteed by publishing the data in supplementary materials or by only making the data available upon request.
qutech.md,This policy recognises that:
qutech.md,Individual divisions and research groups have different working practices and processes and will therefore require dedicated guidelines.
qutech.md,"Research Data Management covers the entire process of managing research data from its creation to its re-use and preservation, which is not equal to Open Science. While it is beneficial to publish research data openly, there might be valid ethical, legal, security or commercial implications, which will make data unsuitable for open sharing."
qutech.md,"Research data is the evidence that underpins answers to research questions, and which is necessary to validate research findings, and includes but is not limited to measurement data, source code, algorithms, simulations and models and other forms of information supporting traditional publications."
qutech.md,"The term raw data is not always uniquely defined. Moreover, this policy recognizes that not necessarily all binary data generated (e.g., by a physical measurement or simulation run) is or was useful for scientific studies or was accessible to the researcher. Therefore, in this policy the term raw data should be interpreted as a sufficient set of data necessary to fully verify and/or replicate the experimental, theoretical or computational results presented as research findings. There is a limit on the amount of information on reproducing research data that is possible to convey by publishing data, and there always remains know-how and expertise (e.g. operating measurements, sample preparation, etc) which is not easy to document and is not usually made public. Some researchers of QuTech are also affiliated with faculties of TU Delft with their own research data policy. If a policy point is not noted here, they should follow the research data policy of their faculty, but otherwise the most stringent requirement needs to be followed."
qutech.md,The key points of this policy are:
qutech.md,All individuals involved in research follow the research data management strategy of QuTech and their research group.
qutech.md,All individuals involved in research attend data management training when required or needed.
qutech.md,"Research data and code needed to reproduce research findings are appropriately documented, stored and shared in a suitable repository. More specifically, the raw and derived data, as well as software scripts used for the full data processing chain, that produce the final figures or tables of a research article are to be published in a trusted data repository (e.g. 4TU.ResearchData or Zenodo.org)"
qutech.md,Data Stewards can assist researchers in these activities.
qutech.md,## QuTech Roles and Responsibilities
qutech.md,### All individuals involved in research are responsible for:
qutech.md,"Ensuring that research data, code and any other materials needed to reproduce research findings are appropriately documented, stored and shared in a research data repository in accordance with the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) for at least 10 years from the end of the research project, unless there are valid reasons not to do so."
qutech.md,"The requirement is that both raw and derived data, as well as the software scripts used for the full data processing chain, that produce the final figures or tables of a publication are published in a trusted data repository such as 4TU.ResearchData or Zenodo.org (also coined as Level 1 data by Quantum Nanoscience department2) no later than the publication of a peer reviewed research article or submission of a traditional research article to a preprint archive (e.g. to arXiv.org). Additionally, the required research data also needs to be made available for the review process of said article through the journal or a data repository. Note that publication of data should be under an as open as possible license3. It is also highly encouraged to record the version of all software components used in generation, analysis or processing of data. Moreover, it is required to deposit code which has been used in the analysis or processing of data together with the published dataset (see also TU Delft Research Software Policy4 for more details on publication of code/software)."
qutech.md,Note that deposition (in public data repositories) of datasets not directly linked with publications is not required but encouraged if the data can possibly be used for other scopes than initially intended.
qutech.md,"Should data which underlies publications, because of valid reasons (e.g. to protect IP sensitive data) not be made available in a public repository, it should be ensured that the data management plan and any research publications resulting from the project have a statement explaining what additional datasets/materials exists; why access is restricted; who can use the data and under what circumstances. Contractual agreements with third parties on confidentiality of data should be respected at all times."
qutech.md,"Understanding who owns research data resulting from their projects and what that implies in terms of data management, particularly sharing and publishing."

radboud-university.md,# Radboud University Guidelines for Research Data Management
radboud-university.md,Established by the Executive Board on 11 July 2023
radboud-university.md,## 1. Preamble
radboud-university.md,"Good research data management (RDM) is important for several reasons. To begin with, ensuring research integrity requires that research results are verifiable. This verifiability requires the findability and accessibility of research data."
radboud-university.md,"Secondly, findable and accessible research data enable other researchers to reproduce or replicate research, where possible. This, in turn, contributes to the quality of scientific research."
radboud-university.md,"Thirdly, the effective management of research data contributes to the potential of its reuse. Making research data findable, accessible and understandable to other researchers contributes to the possibility of using these research data again, in other research. This encourages the efficient and effective use of research resources."
radboud-university.md,"The fourth reason why research data should be properly managed is that it improves the prospects for the recognition and accountability of research. Datasets are increasingly being recognised as stand-alone research outputs, and when properly archived and registered this information can be more adequately considered in the assessment and evaluation of research."
radboud-university.md,"A fifth aspect of importance is privacy. The effective management of research data is necessary for ensuring that any privacy-sensitive information that is collected in the context of scientific research is adequately processed, stored and archived. In this respect, RDM also contributes to ethically responsible research."
radboud-university.md,"Finally, there is also the fact that RDM is becoming more and more important in national and international research policy, and that research funding bodies and scientific journals are increasingly imposing requirements with respect to the archiving and accessibility of research data. This is another reason why the archiving and registration of research data needs to be organised properly."
radboud-university.md,## 2. Legal and policy frameworks
radboud-university.md,"These guidelines elaborate on, or supplement, the following legal and policy frameworks:"
radboud-university.md,"Radboud University’s general strategy on research and impact, and more specifically, its strategy on open science"
radboud-university.md,The Netherlands Code of Conduct for Research Integrity
radboud-university.md,The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
radboud-university.md,Radboud University’s Doctorate Regulations
radboud-university.md,Radboud University’s Knowledge Security Guidelines
radboud-university.md,The requirements from research funding bodies and scientific journals with respect to research data management.
radboud-university.md,## 3. General principles for research data management at Radboud University
radboud-university.md,The following general principles apply to research data management at Radboud University:
radboud-university.md,"1. It is recommended that a data management plan (DMP) is written prior to any study in which research data are to be collected. In their RDM policies, research institutes are free to determine whether, and if so in which cases, a data management plan must be written. This potential obligation is then supplementary to the requirements of the research funding bodies with regard to Data Management Plans."
radboud-university.md,"2. Research data that are collected and processed while research is being carried out should be stored at a facility that is adequate in terms of availability (the data may not inadvertently be lost), integrity (the data may not inadvertently be modified) and confidentiality (the data may not inadvertently be made available to unauthorised persons)."
radboud-university.md,"3. Research data should be archived as open as possible, as closed as necessary. The starting point is that research data should be made publicly available. The only reasons for deviating from this starting point include those that are necessary due to privacy, knowledge security, or other serious grounds. In their RDM policies, research institutes should specify the conditions for open or closed archiving of research data, if relevant."
radboud-university.md,"4. Research data that pertain to scientific publications should meet both the findability and accessibility requirements. In the case of scientific publications that are based on research data, of which one or more Radboud University researchers are authors, it should be evident how the corresponding data can be found and the access management should be well-organised. These requirements should be met within as short a reasonable time as possible once the data collection has been completed, and no later than the moment that the first scientific publication that is based on the research data is available. Further explanation of this has been provided in Appendix 1."
radboud-university.md,5. The minimum retention period for research data that is required for checking or verifying scientific publications is ten years from the time that the scientific publication is available.
radboud-university.md,## 4. Systems and support for research data
radboud-university.md,"Radboud University provides systems and support for the processing, storage, archiving, publishing and registration of research data. Research institutes are free to make choices about the systems that they use to manage their research data, as long as these systems allow them to comply with the present guidelines."
radboud-university.md,"Radboud University provides researchers with support, knowledge and advice on research data management."
radboud-university.md,### 5. Responsibilities of the research institutes
radboud-university.md,"Each research institute at Radboud University has its own research data management policy. The research institute’s RDM policy is a further elaboration of the present guidelines, which is consistent with the research areas in which the research institute is involved."
radboud-university.md,"The researcher and the project manager are primarily responsible for the effective management of research data, and consequently adhere to the policy of the research institute and, in the case of PhD research, the Doctorate Regulations. The Director of Research is responsible for the"
radboud-university.md,"development, establishment and possible modification of the research institute’s RDM policy, and for ensuring its implementation and compliance."
radboud-university.md,Each research institute has one or more data stewards. Data stewards advise researchers and the research institute’s board on research data management and the implementation of and compliance with the research institute’s RDM policy. They also inform researchers about the facilities that are available for research data and privacy. A detailed description of the data stewards’ tasks and responsibilities can be found in Appendix 2.
radboud-university.md,## 6. Research data management within the context of PhD research
radboud-university.md,Additional requirements apply to the management of research data within the context of PhD research. These requirements have been included in Radboud University’s Doctorate Regulations.
radboud-university.md,## 7. Research data management in education
radboud-university.md,"Research data pertaining to Bachelor’s or Master’s theses are stored at a facility that is adequate in terms of availability (the data may not inadvertently be lost), integrity (the data may not inadvertently be modified) and confidentiality (the data may not inadvertently be made available to unauthorised persons). Radboud University provides a system that is suitable for this purpose. Education institutes are free to use this system at their own discretion."
radboud-university.md,"The retention period for research data pertaining to Bachelor’s and Master’s theses is equivalent to the legal retention period for theses, i.e., seven years."
radboud-university.md,"Within the Bachelor’s and Master’s programmes, attention is paid to RDM in a manner that is appropriate to the discipline and the phase of the study programme. Bachelor’s and Master’s theses include a statement on the management of the research data pertaining to the thesis."
radboud-university.md,"The Director of Education is responsible for implementing and enforcing the RDM policy, insofar as it relates to academic higher education."
radboud-university.md,"It is also possible that research data pertaining to Bachelor’s or Master’s theses are part of the research that has been carried out by a researcher or Project Manager. In this case, the general principles for research data management within scientific research, as described in the previous sections, apply."
radboud-university.md,"## Appendix 1: Findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability (FAIR)"
radboud-university.md,"The findability and accessibility of research data are requirements in Radboud University’s research data management (RDM) policy. The definitions of these requirements are based on the common definitions of the FAIR principles (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable). These can be found in the influential paper by Wilkinson and colleagues (2016)1 and on the GO FAIR initiative website2. An explanation of FAIR can also be found on Radboud University’s RDM website."
radboud-university.md,"Findability means that research data can be found in a simple, unambiguous and sustainable manner, both within and outside the organisation, also by persons other than the researcher him or herself. Internal findability refers to the idea that data can be found by colleagues, for instance, and that data can be found for the purpose of gathering management information on RDM and research output. External findability refers to the idea that data can be found by peers who are interested in research data associated with a publication, for instance, and that datasets can be found by search engines. This is made possible in the following way:"
radboud-university.md,Datasets are assigned a persistent identifier (PID). A PID is a permanent and unique reference that is independent of the data storage location. A well-known example of a PID is a DOI (Digital Object Identifier).
radboud-university.md,"Data are accompanied by rich metadata. Metadata is defined as the data that describe the properties of data or a dataset, e.g., title, author, date, descriptive notes and applicable access restrictions. Comprehensive and detailed metadata enhance the findability of a dataset. Rich metadata also include descriptions of the context, content and properties of the data, as part of the documentation of a dataset."
radboud-university.md,The PID of the dataset is part of the metadata that describe the data.
radboud-university.md,Data and/or metadata are registered or indexed in a searchable information source. Th registration or indexing makes it possible to find the chosen archive and its subsequent content via common search engines such as Google Scholar.
radboud-university.md,"Accessibility is not about making research data accessible to everyone at all times, but about the proper regulation and registration of the conditions under which it is possible to access the data and how this can be done (effective access management). This is made possible in the following way:"
radboud-university.md,"Access to data and/or metadata is regulated through a standardised protocol and, if necessary, an access procedure is also used."
radboud-university.md,"The metadata are preserved, even when the full dataset is no longer available.3 This makes it possible to find researchers, organisations and publications that relate to the original research, even at a later date."
radboud-university.md,"Radboud University seeks to ensure the interoperability and reusability of research data. However, these are not current requirements in Radboud University’s RDM policy. Interoperability requires that data can be interpreted and combined, both by people and through automation. Reusability requires that data and metadata are accompanied by explanatory information and that they are accurately described to the point that it is possible to reuse, replicate and combine the data in different contexts and situations."
radboud-university.md,## Appendix 2: Tasks and responsibilities of the data stewards
radboud-university.md,"Each of Radboud University’s research institutes has one or more data stewards. The summary shown below outlines their work activities, distinguishing between their essential tasks and responsibilities and optional activities. The essential tasks and responsibilities apply to all Radboud University data stewards, while optional tasks or responsibilities may be carried out or borne by some data stewards."
radboud-university.md,Essential tasks: What do Radboud University data stewards at any rate?
radboud-university.md,"Advise researchers on the management and storage of research data during a research study and for the longer term, which includes the possible publication of data."
radboud-university.md,Actively contribute to the implementation and subsequent improvement of RDM within their own institute.
radboud-university.md,"Actively contribute to the implementation of the institute’s RDM policy and, if necessary, make suggestions for updating this policy."
radboud-university.md,Assist in the compliance with the RDM policy within the institute and have a basic understanding of such compliance.
radboud-university.md,"Are familiar with the ethical and legal issues that relate to the research data within their own discipline, and are able to refer researchers to the relevant advisors and committees in this field."
radboud-university.md,Inform the research institute’s board about the implementation of and compliance with the research institute’s RDM policy.
radboud-university.md,Stay abreast of new developments and take part in the activities and initiatives within Radboud University that pertain to RDM.
radboud-university.md,"Optional tasks: Which tasks may be part of a data steward’s job, but are not part of the standard range of tasks?"
radboud-university.md,"Provide feedback on data management plans and sections on data management. Provide advice on data collection, which includes providing advice on the reuse of existing data."
radboud-university.md,Develop RDM work processes.
radboud-university.md,Organise RDM training programmes or courses.
radboud-university.md,"Develop and update products that support RDM, such as websites, manuals, course materials, demos and e-learning modules."
radboud-university.md,Check to see whether data management plans are being written.
radboud-university.md,Monitor compliance with the FAIR principles.
radboud-university.md,Oversee long-term archiving of data.
radboud-university.md,Check to see whether data are being managed by active staff members; make sure that the transition is smooth when staff members leave their job.
radboud-university.md,"Identify potential privacy and security risks, including those risks associated with the GDPR."

royal-college-of-art.md,# Royal College of Art - Research Data Management Policy
royal-college-of-art.md,## 1. Introduction
royal-college-of-art.md,"This policy presents the principles of good research data management (RDM) within the Royal College of Art (RCA), as well as outlining the roles and responsibilities of the RCA and its staff and students in this respect. Research data is an asset and the RCA recognises its benefit and impact for wider society, the research community, the RCA and its individual researchers. Effective management of research data allows for extension of the value of data beyond the life of any research project, through data openness and sharing, and is an important part of good research conduct. Well managed data leads to higher quality research, increased research visibility and enhanced research collaboration opportunities. RDM is important in light of increasingly collaborative nature of research, where researchers need to share data across platforms and thus need effective systems and processes for storing, accessing and sharing data securely across multi-institutional research teams."
royal-college-of-art.md,"Research data is increasingly being shared and published openly, and public research funders now request a data management plan (DMP) to be delivered with each project they fund1. The plans describe the plans for management of data through the project lifecycle as well plans for storage and curation of data after the project ends. Funders ask that data be published openly if possible, but demonstrate an understanding that some data may not be deemed suitable for open publishing due to legal, commercial and ethical reasons."
royal-college-of-art.md,"The concept of research data within art and design may differ somewhat from that of other disciplines. Research at the RCA encompasses a broad range of disciplines, to include Architecture, Design, Robotics and Materials Science. The variety of research data created within the RCA will take many forms and will mirror this variety of disciplines, processes and the different types of output developed through research and innovation."
royal-college-of-art.md,"RCA is a research-intensive specialist art and design university, which is committed to upholding highest standards of academic research with their staff, students and the broader research community. We aim for research excellence, through providing a supportive research environment, to research staff and students. To this end, RCA has produced this Policy and provides services and guidance to support research staff and students in undertaking best practice in RDM. To further support staff in implementing this policy, RCA facilitates appropriate digital infrastructure to ensure that data is securely stored and is findable, accessible, interoperable and re-usable by others. The RCA understands that not all data can be shared, or made open, due to legal, commercial and ethical reasons, but also that these issues should not stand in the way of good research data management."
royal-college-of-art.md,## 2. Scope
royal-college-of-art.md,"2.1 This policy applies to all data generated through research undertaken by RCA research staff and students (henceforth referred to as researchers), either solely or in collaboration with others. This includes, but is not limited to, research sponsored by grant funding or commercial contracts awarded to RCA and to other institutions with which RCA partners in undertaking research."
royal-college-of-art.md,"2.2 The research data referred to in this policy includes, but is not limited to: image data (2D, 3D and video), audio data (music, sounds) sketchbooks, log books, trials, prototypes, ceramic glaze recipes, objects, and correspondence. Furthermore, data collected from human participants in the form of fieldnotes, photographs, survey findings, interview and focus group transcripts falls under the remit of research data and this policy."
royal-college-of-art.md,"2.3 RCA researchers should familiarise themselves with this policy, and consult it prior to commencing a research project or research student supervision. An ‘at a glance’ summary is provided in Annex X."
royal-college-of-art.md,"2.4 This policy should be read in conjunction with other related RCA policies, including the RCA Research Ethics Policy, the RCA Information and Data Management Policy, RCA Policy on Ownership, Protection and Exploitation of Intellectual Property Rights, and RCA Open Access Policy. Links to these policy documents are in Annex B."
royal-college-of-art.md,## 3. Definitions
royal-college-of-art.md,"3.1 Data Management Plan: A Data Management Plan outlines what data is likely to be created through the course of research and how. The plan also outlines plans for the preservation of the data and how/if it will be shared, stating any restrictions on access that may need to be applied."
royal-college-of-art.md,"3.2 Data Repository: A place for preserving digital data after a project ends, and making it available for others to use. Selecting a trusted repository for your data The RCA research repository (ePrints), a discipline specific repository or a funder repository) is beneficial in that it will relieve the researcher of the long-term management of the data and will ensure its long term accessibility."
royal-college-of-art.md,"3.3 Principal Investigator: A person who is ultimately responsible for a research project. This includes intellectual, managerial and financial responsibility of research."
royal-college-of-art.md,3.4 Permanent Digital Identifier (PDI): A unique permanent digital identifier used to identify datasets and publications. The PDI is fixed for the lifetime of the data and ensures that data can be cited appropriately to ensure credit is given to its creator/s.
royal-college-of-art.md,"3.5 Metadata: Metadata provides information about the dataset. This information includes descriptive information such as keywords, author, title and also process data which will describe methods through which data is collected and processed. Good standard metadata is vital for enabling the finding and reuse of data."
royal-college-of-art.md,"3.6 Data Licencing: Datasets should have a licence that states clearly what the re-use rights are. This will allow researchers who find a dataset to immediately know what they are allowed to do with it. For example, licenced images or music will state how specifically whether commercial use is allowed, whether the work can be remixed or tweaked, or whether it can be downloaded only. Licencing also applies to research data."
royal-college-of-art.md,## 4. Guiding principles
royal-college-of-art.md,"4.1 RDM is part of good research practice and as such adds value to research outputs and increases their impact. This policy will guide RCA researchers to undertake best practice in RDM to ensure excellence in research conduct and to comply with funders’ requirements of data management, openness and sharing."

sheffield-hallam-university.md,"3.4. All data that are retained must be registered with the SHU Research Data Archive, whether they are hosted by the University or maintained elsewhere, even if access to the data is restricted."
sheffield-hallam-university.md,### 4. Open access
sheffield-hallam-university.md,"4.1. Researchers must be aware of, and comply with, their funders' requirements for data management including archiving and sharing. If applicable, data must be prepared and offered for deposit in an open access data repository within the timeframe stipulated by the funder unless there are valid reasons not to do so. The latter could include commercial confidentiality, infringement of intellectual property rights, contractual agreements, ethical, legal or regulatory obligations, or where the cost of doing so would be prohibitive."
sheffield-hallam-university.md,"4.2. Even if the funder of the research does not require it, researchers are encouraged to make their archived data accessible to others close to the publication date of any research outputs relying on the data. The data should be in citeable form. This supports the integrity of the University's research and will be beneficial for the research community."
sheffield-hallam-university.md,4.3. Exclusive rights to re-use or publish research data should not be handed over to commercial publishers or agents without retaining the rights to make the data openly available for re-use unless this is a condition of funding.
sheffield-hallam-university.md,4.4. Published research outputs reporting publicly funded research must include a short statement describing how and on what terms any supporting research data may be accessed. Research outputs deposited in SHURA should also include this statement.
sheffield-hallam-university.md,5. Re-using third-party data
sheffield-hallam-university.md,"5.1. Researchers that gain access to and use open research data, or any data generated by others, must do so in a manner that respects the contexts under which it was created and must"
sheffield-hallam-university.md,adhere to the same frameworks and observe any restrictions that may have been imposed during data collection.
sheffield-hallam-university.md,5.2. All users of research data must formally cite the data they use. The obligation to recognise through citation and acknowledgement the original creators of the data must be respected in all cases.

sorbonne-university.md,## Open research data policy within the Sorbonne University Alliance
sorbonne-university.md,"Since its creation, the Sorbonne University Alliance has chosen to be fully involved in the open science movement, allowing access to knowledge for all. With this in mind, it is committed to opening up the results of the research produced within its institutions and promoting their dissemination, in order to share with citizens the fruits of their contribution to public research and to develop a trustworthy science."
sorbonne-university.md,"Taking up for itself the terms of the Sorbonne declaration on research data rights of 27 January 20201, the Sorbonne University Alliance recalls that :"
sorbonne-university.md,"access to and sharing of data enables the development of new knowledge and accelerates discoveries for the benefit of society, while promoting economic development and employment;"
sorbonne-university.md,it must be possible to share and re-use research data freely.
sorbonne-university.md,"The management of research data, including backup, storage and diffusion, must therefore be carried out in accordance with international standards and practices and meet strict requirements, while ensuring compliance with legal obligations within an ethical framework."
sorbonne-university.md,"For these reasons, the Sorbonne University Alliance and its members are committed to :"
sorbonne-university.md,encouraging their research teams and staff to open up research data as much as possible;
sorbonne-university.md,promoting the development of data management plans at the design stage of research protocols;
sorbonne-university.md,enhancing the commitment of research staff who share their data and work for open science;
sorbonne-university.md,setting up training programmes and mobilising the necessary resources to create an environment conducive to open data.
sorbonne-university.md,"Consequently, the member institutions of the Sorbonne University Alliance commit themselves to implementing the following recommendations for the opening of research data."
sorbonne-university.md,### Recommendations for the opening of research data within the Sorbonne University Alliance
sorbonne-university.md,"To implement the policy of opening up research data, the institutions of the Sorbonne University Alliance have set themselves the following objectives:"
sorbonne-university.md,to raise awareness of open data among research staff in different communities and disciplines and promote the dissemination of good practice;

sorbonne-university.md,"In order to implement the proposed recommendations and come up with operational solutions, staff and financial resources will be needed in each of the institutions of the Sorbonne University Alliance."
sorbonne-university.md,"In addition to the initial funding that may be obtained with the PIA allocation, the institutions of the Sorbonne University Alliance undertake to :"
sorbonne-university.md,"respond to regional, national or international calls for projects concerning the opening up of data, either individually or jointly, with the institutions keeping each other informed of any responses to calls for projects that they may make individually;"
sorbonne-university.md,"ensure the sustainability of the services offered in terms of access to data and metadata, whether shared, stored or archived."
staffordshire-university.md,# Staffordshire University Research Data Management Policy
staffordshire-university.md,## Preamble:
staffordshire-university.md,"Good research data management enables the University and its researchers to meet the standards and responsibilities set out in the University's Code of Conduct for Research and Research Integrity (  and to meet funder, ethical, legal and other responsibilities. This policy is binding on all University members engaged in research, including staff, research students, and affiliates, and others who conduct research on behalf of the University. The policy is guided by and adheres to the UK General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) and the Data Protection Act (2018)."
staffordshire-university.md,# Policy
staffordshire-university.md,"1. Staffordshire University recognises the importance of establishing appropriate systems, policies and processes to govern the ways in which research data generated as part of the University’s research activity are managed."
staffordshire-university.md,"2. This policy applies to all those undertaking research (including staff and postgraduate researchers) and those managing and supporting research; and to all research, whether externally funded or not."
staffordshire-university.md,3. This policy requires that all those undertaking research store unpublished University research data within Microsoft SharePoint through a Microsoft Teams Team1.
staffordshire-university.md,"4. It is the responsibility of the principal investigator of the research study to ensure the data for their studies is stored according to this policy. It is assumed that research data obtained will be digital, or can be digitised and then stored according to this policy. It is expected that only in very rare cases will it be impossible to digitise the data, in which case the principal investigator should make this clear on the Ethics application, and furthermore make clear how the data will be stored. The principal investigator should further ensure that personal data is stored as required by the University’s Code of Conduct for Research and Research Integrity, and Annex 1 to that code, the ‘Framework for Good Research Practice’2; furthermore, a separate Teams channel, or private channel, should be used for personal data. Personalised data and anonymised data should be stored in separate locations. The principal investigator is the named lead researcher at Staffordshire University responsible for delivery of the research, or the component of research assigned to the University. The principal investigator must describe in the study protocol (or within the research methodology) the name of the Microsoft Teams Team that will be used to store the data, who will have access to the data and what Microsoft Team authority they will have (member or owner). Where named individuals are known, this should be given. In roles that are not yet occupied, the role title should be used. It is the responsibility of all researchers who have access to the data to comply with this policy for all research data that they process. If the ‘raw’ data is not immediately stored on Teams but is captured on a separate device, the data should be uploaded to Teams as soon as is practicable, which must be within two weeks. If it is known before the research starts that this time scale will not be met, this should be made clear on the Ethics application. Before data is transferred, it is the responsibility of the individual to ensure that it is secured according to the legal standards to which this policy adheres and to Staffordshire University IT regulations (  In the case of postgraduate research students, it is the responsibility of both the student and their supervisor to ensure that their research data is stored in accordance with this policy."
staffordshire-university.md,"5. If the principal investigator leaves the University, they must inform their line manager and their School’s Associate Dean for Research and Innovation of the name, description and location of the data. If the research study is still ongoing, a new principal investigator will be assigned, and they will assume responsibility for the research data. In the event that the research study has concluded, or that no one else remains employed at the University, the Associate Dean for Research and Innovation of the School in which the original principal investigator worked will assume responsibility until the data has exceeded its retention period."
staffordshire-university.md,"6. In the event that Staffordshire University is not the lead research organisation, it is recognised that data may need to be transferred and/or stored according to other University’s policy and procedure. Where another organisation’s policy and procedure is put in place, the Staffordshire University (via the principal investigator and copying in dataprotection@staffs.ac.uk) should be notified in writing."
staffordshire-university.md,"7. It is acknowledged that some research data may not be transferred to the University in order to be compliant with legislation. Where this is the case, it should be clearly stated in the study protocol, or within the research methodology before any research activity commences and should be clearly stated in any ethics application documentation."
staffordshire-university.md,"8. When creating a ‘Team’ to store research, a separate site should be created for each research project. This enables appropriate levels of access and control to be applied to each project, and simplifies compliance with any legal, contractual or regulatory requirements."
staffordshire-university.md,"9. When creating a Teams site: The site must be given a meaningful name and include the reference number from the ethics application. If the title contains the word “Research” then a default data retention policy is applied to the team site to preserve all files stored on the “File” tab for 3 years. Privacy levels must be set to “Private – only team owners can add members”. This restricts access to just the individuals that have been authorised by the owner of the site. Site owners should undertake at appropriate intervals reviews of who has access to the site, and remove access from individuals or add access to individuals as appropriate."
staffordshire-university.md,"10. To allow researchers to retain data for a specified period of time, Staffordshire University has implemented a policy that detects key words within SharePoint sites’ description and"
staffordshire-university.md,applies corresponding data protection policies.
staffordshire-university.md,"If the keywords “Hold1”, “Hold2”, … , “Hold10” are added to a SharePoint site’s description then data on the site is retained for the corresponding number of years (i.e. 1, 2,…10 years) after it was last modified."
staffordshire-university.md,"If a greater retention period is required, then Digital Services should be contacted to add a custom retention hold to the site."
staffordshire-university.md,"11. Similarly, it may be required to delete data after a specified period. The keywords “Delete1”, “Delete2”, …., “Delete10” can be added to a site to delete data a specified number of years after it was last modified."
staffordshire-university.md,12. Holds and deletes are calculated for each individual file based on its last modification date.
staffordshire-university.md,"13. If both “Hold” and “Delete” policies apply to a site, then both processes will take effect. If the retention hold is greater than the delete then files will not be deleted until after the hold period."
staffordshire-university.md,"14. Note that if required, a researcher can check what hold/delete policies are applicable to their sites by using  SharePoint search functionality at   Searching for e.g. “description:hold5” would list sites with a five year retention period."
staffordshire-university.md,15. Researchers who are intending to collect and store highly sensitive/confidential research data should discuss with Digital Services how such data can be protected.
staffordshire-university.md,16. This could include:
staffordshire-university.md,Requiring Multi-factor authentication in order to access a team site. This protects from phished/stolen credentials being used to access a site
staffordshire-university.md,"Requiring use of a University managed computer to access a team site. This protects phished/stolen credentials being used to access a site, and makes it more difficult to extract data from a site."
staffordshire-university.md,"Preventing file download from non-university managed computers, but providing a web edit view to authorised users to allow controlled viewing and editing of files. This make it more difficult to extract data from a site, or for ransomware/malware to be"
staffordshire-university.md,introduced into a site.

swedish-university-of-agricultural-sciences.md,## 1. Introduction
swedish-university-of-agricultural-sciences.md,The research as well as environmental monitoring and assessment conducted at SLU shall be characterised by good data management throughout the life cycle. Current legislation and good research practice1 provide the framework for how data shall be managed. SLU endorses the FAIR data sharing principles2 and aims to make data from research and from environmental monitoring and assessment as open as possible and as closed as necessary.
swedish-university-of-agricultural-sciences.md,"The purpose of this policy is to describe the direction taken by SLU and common principles SLU stands for with regard to data management, the existing legal requirements, and the responsibilities assigned within the University. The policy does not regulate in detail what data shall be made accessible, in what format, or at what time. This assessment must be made by the data producer based on the given circumstances of the project or study in question and the common principles presented in this policy. Good data management also includes clarifying the contexts which necessitate special protection of data. If necessary, the assessment can be made in consultation with the support functions available at the University with the aid of a data management plan as an important tool."
swedish-university-of-agricultural-sciences.md,The policy is a comprehensive governing document that is supplemented with additional information and practical instructions on the staff web3.
swedish-university-of-agricultural-sciences.md,There is also an extensive guide on data management published by the Swedish Research Council.4
swedish-university-of-agricultural-sciences.md,## 2. Purpose and scope of the policy
swedish-university-of-agricultural-sciences.md,"Open knowledge sharing and open science are emphasised in SLU's strategy for 2021-20255, at the national level in the Research Policy Bill for 2021-20246, and at European level in the EU Open Data Directive7. The goal at national level is to make all publicly funded research data openly accessible by 2026, provided there are no legal, security, ethical, or commercial issues. The aim is to increase the quality, dissemination, impact, and innovative power of research. Another reason for making data accessible is to make efficient use of resources. This concerns both financial resources and, for example, a reduction in the use of animal and human experiments. An important starting point for this policy is the national Roadmap for Open Science devised by the Association of Swedish Higher Education8, which clarifies the responsibilities of higher education institutions and the measures required to accelerate the work on open access to research data and results."
swedish-university-of-agricultural-sciences.md,[Read more about background to and rationale for the policy]
swedish-university-of-agricultural-sciences.md,"The policy supports SLU staff in the transition to open science by expressing common principles and assigning responsibilities regarding the management and accessibility of research as well as environmental monitoring and assessment data throughout its entire lifecycle9. It serves as a guide in the development of einfrastructures and support functions and it also aims to ensure that the University complies with relevant legislation and commitments to external stakeholders when it comes to data management. SLU, moreover, has a policy for scientific publishing10 in place, which represents an additional important component in the work to promote open science."
swedish-university-of-agricultural-sciences.md,"The policy applies only to digital material, both raw and aggregated data, that is produced, processed and used in projects and studies at SLU and that underlies the results, conclusions, and bases for decision-making generated by research as well as environmental monitoring and assessment."
swedish-university-of-agricultural-sciences.md,[Read more about data definitions]
swedish-university-of-agricultural-sciences.md,The policy is supplemented with instructions on SLU’s staff web11.
swedish-university-of-agricultural-sciences.md,## 3. Basic data management principles at SLU
swedish-university-of-agricultural-sciences.md,"SLU endorses the FAIR data sharing principles12 (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) and considers properly managed, accessible, and reusable data as a valuable and necessary resource for conducting research, teaching and environmental monitoring and assessment of high quality. Data made openly accessible also generates added value in the form of increased utilisation and visibility of SLU's research as well as environmental monitoring and assessment. Good management of data throughout its entire lifecycle13 is a prerequisite for being able to comply with the FAIR data sharing principles to the greatest extent possible."

swedish-university-of-agricultural-sciences.md,be openly with as few restrictions as possible.
swedish-university-of-agricultural-sciences.md,Accessible data shall:
swedish-university-of-agricultural-sciences.md,"be searchable and provided with descriptive metadata enabling others to understand and reuse it, be identifiable, verifiable, and reusable by humans as well as machines."
swedish-university-of-agricultural-sciences.md,## 4. Legal aspects of research and environmental monitoring and assessment data
swedish-university-of-agricultural-sciences.md,"Under Swedish law, data cannot be owned in a legal sense. However, its use and handling may be regulated in different ways. It is important to ensure whether and how datasets in question are regulated in the context of both use and accessibility. Any agreements and regulations (listed below) take precedence over the principles of this policy, however, the principles should be taken into account as far as possible when formulating agreements."
swedish-university-of-agricultural-sciences.md,### 4.1 Regulation of data
swedish-university-of-agricultural-sciences.md,Research and environmental monitoring and assessment data managed at SLU may:
swedish-university-of-agricultural-sciences.md,"be protected by database rights (it is the compilation that is protected, no the individual data),"
swedish-university-of-agricultural-sciences.md,"constitute material protected by copyright or photographic rights (e.g., publications or images),"
swedish-university-of-agricultural-sciences.md,"be regulated contractually as for use and management,"
swedish-university-of-agricultural-sciences.md,"be protected under trade secrets legislation16,"

swedish-university-of-agricultural-sciences.md,be protected under security protection legislation18.
swedish-university-of-agricultural-sciences.md,contain personal data in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)19
swedish-university-of-agricultural-sciences.md,These protections or rights may in turn be restricted by provisions within administrative law such as:
swedish-university-of-agricultural-sciences.md,"the University's obligation to disclose public documents (including electronic documents such as a data file),"
swedish-university-of-agricultural-sciences.md,"the bill on Public Sector Data Accessibility20,"

swedish-university-of-agricultural-sciences.md,"Policy on the management of and open access to research and environmental monitoring and assessment data at SLU environmental monitoring and contract research22), the agreements take precedence over this policy, however not over current legislation. The agreements shall specify the data management responsibilities as well as whether and how the data is to be stored and made accessible and which respective party is responsible for archiving and making data accessible. If ownership is agreed upon, it does not mean that a party owns the data but rather that the party has rights and obligations towards the other parties within the project/study that usually come with ownership (such as the right to use the data in further research or commercially, the right to publish, and archive them, etc.). Confidentiality can also be agreed upon but then binds no one other than the contracting parties. The principle of public access to official documents cannot be waived, and should there be no basis for confidentiality according to the Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act23 then the data must be disclosed upon request. To the extent that a funder imposes requirements on how data within a project or study should be stored and made openly available, the funder's requirements shall be followed, provided that Swedish legislation is complied with. Should data belong to another organisation, such as a private company or a public authority in another country, access may be restricted or blocked. In such cases, it is important that an agreement governs the accessibility and availability of data during the project."

swedish-university-of-agricultural-sciences.md,## 5. Applying the principles in projects and studies
swedish-university-of-agricultural-sciences.md,"The life-cycle of research and environmental monitoring and assessment data24 includes planning, collecting, documenting, processing, storing, making accessible and archiving of data. Future (re)use of the material is facilitated by a structured way of working and by making the information comprehensible at all stages. The aim is to make data easy to find and interpret, both now and in the future, to facilitate continuity within projects and studies and to enable validation, sharing, and re-use of data."
swedish-university-of-agricultural-sciences.md,"Projects and studies at SLU vary greatly in nature and scope. This policy describes principles but does not intend to regulate what data shall be made accessible, in what form (raw data, processed data, aggregated data), or at what time. This must be considered in relation to the given circumstances of a project, and it is up to the data producer to make this type of assessment, preferably in consultation with the support functions available at the University. The content of the data management plan (see below) is a starting point for these decisions."
swedish-university-of-agricultural-sciences.md,### 5.1 Data management plans
swedish-university-of-agricultural-sciences.md,"A data management plan25 must be drawn up, registered, and then maintained over time for each new project and/or study in research and environmental monitoring and assessment at SLU. The data management plan is based on a template26,"
swedish-university-of-agricultural-sciences.md,"Policy on the management of and open access to research and environmental monitoring and assessment data at SLU addressing various aspects of data management during the implementation of the project. The plan describes the managing of data, including archiving and making it available27, in a systematic way. A well-thought-out data management plan can, thus, facilitate compliance with the principles described in this policy."
swedish-university-of-agricultural-sciences.md,The data management plan template recommended by SLU includes:
swedish-university-of-agricultural-sciences.md,"data description (what data will be collected/generated and how), data documentation and data quality,"
swedish-university-of-agricultural-sciences.md,"data storage and data backup,"

swedish-university-of-agricultural-sciences.md,responsibilities and resources.
swedish-university-of-agricultural-sciences.md,"To reflect changes over time, the plan shall be updated on a regular basis as long as the project or study is ongoing. The plan shall, among other things, state who assumes overall responsibility for managing the data generated28. The plan shall, furthermore, illustrate how the management of data in accordance with current legislation and good research practice29 is ensured, and it must be clear when, how and where the data will be made accessible. The content of the data management plan can be discussed with SLU's support units in order to identify the aspects that are relevant to be highlighted in the plan."

swedish-university-of-agricultural-sciences.md,### 5.2 Storage
swedish-university-of-agricultural-sciences.md,"Storage refers to the storage of data both during ongoing activities and prior to making data accessible and archiving. Data together with associated metadata and potential other documentation must be stored in a secure manner. They shall be protected from unauthorised access and loss, independent of whether or not the data are to be made publicly accessible. Computers and storage media that are not regularly backed up shall not be used for primary data storage in research projects and environmental monitoring and assessment studies. In order to be able to use a cloud service for storing personal data, there must be a data processing agreement with the supplier of the service. Cloud services may not be used for storing or processing sensitive personal data. Remember not to store personal data in a third country (third countries are usually outside the EU/EEA area)."

swedish-university-of-agricultural-sciences.md,### 5.4 Accessibility
swedish-university-of-agricultural-sciences.md,#### Where and how?
swedish-university-of-agricultural-sciences.md,"One way to make data accessible for reuse is to upload and describe data files in, preferably certified, data catalogues (repositories) where data is accessible via the web35. Data generated at SLU should, as far as possible, be made openly accessible in data catalogues that provide data with a persistent identifier (PID) 36 in order to, among other things, facilitate proper citation of data. So as to comply with the FAIR data sharing principles, SLU offers support in reviewing and improving metadata and data when making it accessible and depositing, both in data catalogues37 and other commonly existing solutions utilised in research as well as environmental monitoring and assessment at SLU."
swedish-university-of-agricultural-sciences.md,"In data catalogues, the data licence can often be specified in the metadata. By means of licences users become aware of the purposes for which data may be used and the conditions for further sharing. Licensing is an important component of meeting the FAIR data sharing principles. However, principles for licensing data by SLU are not included in this version of the policy due to ongoing national discussions on this issue."
swedish-university-of-agricultural-sciences.md,[Read more about data licensing]
swedish-university-of-agricultural-sciences.md,#### When?
swedish-university-of-agricultural-sciences.md,"Data must be made available according to the principle ""as early as possible, as late as necessary"", based on the conditions of the project or study. Within environmental monitoring and assessment, each study must consider when it is appropriate to make data available, since much data collection continues over time without a cut-off date. Even in time-limited projects, especially should such run over a longer period of time, reasons may exist to make subsets of data accessible already during the course of the project."
swedish-university-of-agricultural-sciences.md,"Embargoes may arise between project completion or publication of research results and the time when data may be made accessible. This may, for example, be due to the data being a trade secret in which case the timing of making data available"
swedish-university-of-agricultural-sciences.md,Policy on the management of and open access to research and environmental monitoring and assessment data at SLU

swedish-university-of-agricultural-sciences.md,#### Restricted access
swedish-university-of-agricultural-sciences.md,"Certain types of data may not be made openly accessible due to restrictions such as confidentiality or personal data. In such cases, metadata should still be made available if possible. Should even the publication of metadata be deemed unsuitable with regard to national or information security in general, then publication shall be avoided. Such an assessment can be made in consultation with SLU's support functions."

swedish-university-of-agricultural-sciences.md,### 5.5 Archiving
swedish-university-of-agricultural-sciences.md,"Research and environmental monitoring and assessment data generated at SLU are considered official documents and are subject to the constitutional principle of public access to official records38. Thus, data must be, as a rule, released upon request and preserved in SLU's archives. Copyright applies to the results of research recorded in a work (e.g., a scientific publication). Primary data must be archived and preserved in order to make such research results verifiable. Laws and regulations govern whether confidentiality can be invoked or whether documents can be disposed of after a certain time.39 Archiving of research and environmental monitoring and assessment data requires that the data is well documented, reliable, and readable. The archiving requirements are in many ways consistent with what is needed for information security and making data accessible, yet preserving documents is not the same as storing or making data accessible. Prior to and during projects and studies that generate data, those responsible must decide what applies to, for example, confidentiality and disposal deadlines, preferably in a data management plan. Data must be archived at the latest at the end of a project or study."

swedish-university-of-agricultural-sciences.md,## 6. Roles and responsibilities
swedish-university-of-agricultural-sciences.md,"6.1 Staff engaged in research and environmental monitoring and assessment The person responsible for a study always has primary responsibility for his or her own activities and must ensure that good research practice, current legislation, and established procedures are followed. This responsibility also includes good and appropriate data management. Should a student carry out an independent project within the framework of an ongoing research project, the project manager of the research project is responsible for the necessary management of collected data.40"
swedish-university-of-agricultural-sciences.md,"For all projects or studies carried out at SLU, a data controller must be appointed and named in the data management plan. In most cases, it is appropriate for the project’s Project Manager (PI) or equivalent to be the data controller, however the role may also be assigned to someone else. Though, the data controller shall be distinguished from the person responsible for the data-managing infrastructure. The data controller has overall responsibility for the management of data within a project or study (as defined below) but not necessarily for the technology or infrastructure deployed in the process."
swedish-university-of-agricultural-sciences.md,### The data controller shall
swedish-university-of-agricultural-sciences.md,"ensure good and appropriate management of data in accordance with the principles of this policy,"
swedish-university-of-agricultural-sciences.md,"assure that agreements regarding responsibility and data management are drawn up where necessary, particularly in cases where researchers from several organisations collaborate on a project, during collaboration with industry representatives, during contract research, and towards external clients for data hosting."
swedish-university-of-agricultural-sciences.md,"Should the data controller leave SLU or is unable to fulfil his/her duties for any other reason, formal responsibility is transferred to the head of the department where the project is based, unless another person is appointed. Should data from research or environmental monitoring and assessment be handed over to another part of SLU, responsibility is transferred to that part of the organisation. A researcher, or a person engaged in environmental monitoring and assessment, who terminates his/her employment at the University is responsible for handing over the data is to the department for further use and subsequent archiving at the latest at the end of his/her employment, as well as for maintaining a dialogue with the support functions regarding making the data accessible. Data produced as part of projects or studies conducted at SLU must be kept at the University, even if the responsible personnel change their place of work."
swedish-university-of-agricultural-sciences.md,### 6.2 Heads of department or equivalent
swedish-university-of-agricultural-sciences.md,"In accordance with the vice-chancellor's delegation of authority41, the head of department is responsible for ensuring that education, research, as well as environmental monitoring and assessment of the highest quality are carried out within the department's area of expertise and within the means available."

technical-university-delft.md,### FAIR Data Principles
technical-university-delft.md,"Set of guiding principles to make data F indable, A ccessible, I nteroperable, and R eusable. FORCE11 is the organisation which defined these principles and which also provides an explanation of their exact meaning and implementation."
technical-university-delft.md,### Personal data
technical-university-delft.md,"According to new European Data Protection Regulation personal data means “any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.”"
technical-university-delft.md,### Research data
technical-university-delft.md,"Research data is the evidence that underpins answers to research questions, and which is necessary to validate research findings. Data can come in various forms and types, characteristic to specific disciplines of research. For example, data can be quantitative information or qualitative statements collected by researchers in the course of their work by experimentation, observation, modelling, interview or other methods, or information derived from existing evidence. Research data also includes elements that make the data reusable or re-workable, e.g. documentation of the research process (e.g. in lab- or notebooks), or underlying software3."

technical-university-of-darmstadt.md,# Guidelines on Digital Research Data at TU Darmstadt
technical-university-of-darmstadt.md,Translation of the official German text „Leitlinien zum Umgang mit digitalen Forschungsdaten an der TU Darmstadt“
technical-university-of-darmstadt.md,"from December 12th 2015, revised on September 8th 2022"
technical-university-of-darmstadt.md,## Preamble
technical-university-of-darmstadt.md,"The Technical University of Darmstadt (TUDa) considers the responsible and scientifically appropriate handling of research data to be an essential contribution to the acquisition and dissemination of scientific knowledge as an implementation of its principles for ensuring good scientific practice. In line with the institutional goals of sustainability and digitization, it promotes and supports the preservation and documentation of research data as well as structured and free access to them in accordance with the FAIR principles with the aim of increasing the findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability of research data. The guidelines for handling digital research data apply to all research projects at TU Darmstadt, including student work."
technical-university-of-darmstadt.md,"Traceability and scientific verifiability of research as well as the best possible scientific use of the data obtained are equally important goals. When implementing research data management, the guidelines take into account the specific characteristics of the various disciplines. The implementation of the guidelines should not restrict the commercial exploitation of research results."
technical-university-of-darmstadt.md,"The implementation of the guidelines is accompanied by the central working group TUdata, which provides technical, organizational and legal advice on all areas of research data management and supports the members of TUDa with a broad service portfolio and recommendations for action. To this end, TUDa cooperates with other scientific institutions, participates in the National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI) and uses common standards and structures."
technical-university-of-darmstadt.md,## Definitions
technical-university-of-darmstadt.md,"1. Research data are all digital data that are created by transformation from an analogue medium or in the course of experiments, measurements, simulations, computer program development, studies of primary sources, surveys or inquiries or are their result. Associated with them are also the metadata, documentation, and software necessary to understand them. Research data exists in a variety of digital formats and stages of processing and aggregation in every scientific discipline."
technical-university-of-darmstadt.md,"2. Research data management is understood to refer to the entire handling of digital data in research, from the planning of its generation, through its organization, use and processing in research projects, to its selection and permanent archiving or even deletion, with the aim of achieving the aforementioned goals. This includes, in particular, the discipline-specific documentation of its creation in digital form, the secure storage, the appropriate processing and, if applicable, the publication in a suitable form."
technical-university-of-darmstadt.md,## Guidelines
technical-university-of-darmstadt.md,"1.	 The planning and execution of a research project also include research data management. This concerns, for example, the type of data generated and used in the course of the project, information on the required accuracy and scope of the data and metadata to be collected, measures to maintain the integrity and authenticity of the data, as well as information on confidentiality, retention and planned publication, including clarification of intellectual property rights and rights of use. These aspects should be systematically prepared and recorded in a suitable form (data management plan). Subject-specific characteristics and standards must be taken into account and the data management plan must be adapted in line with the current progress of the project."
technical-university-of-darmstadt.md,"2.	 The leaders of a research project are responsible for the management of all resulting research data during its entire duration. In consultation with the researchers involved, they decide on the selection of research data to be archived and the time, place and conditions of its archiving and, if applicable, its publication. In particular, all project participants are obliged to ensure compliance with good scientific practice and long-term archiving, as well as to implement the relevant requirements of the research funders and partners. In doing so, they take ethical, data protection and copyright aspects into account."
technical-university-of-darmstadt.md,"3. Research data must be archived to the extent and for the periods specified in the Guidelines for Safeguarding Good Scientific Practice (usually at least ten years). As a rule, this archiving should take place in a recognized discipline-specific research data repository1 or in the institutional repository of TUDa (TUdatalib2). If there are reasons why archiving at the above-mentioned locations is not possible, an archiving solution should be chosen that ensures a similar level of long-term integrity preservation, accessibility and findability of the data. If the data volume of the research data to be stored is too high for complete archiving, a selection will be made according to the aspects of traceability, reproducibility and reusability."
technical-university-of-darmstadt.md,"4. In order to ensure the traceability and reproducibility of research results, research data should be published at an appropriate time and to an appropriate extent, unless other regulations (e.g. contracts in commissioned research or data protection law) or a planned commercial exploitation prevent this. In order to ensure their reusability and in accordance with the Open Access Policy of the TU Darmstadt,3 published research data should be assigned as open a license as possible. To implement the FAIR principles, the metadata describing the research data must be published to an appropriate extent."
technical-university-of-darmstadt.md,"5.	 The source code of self-developed research software, which was created at the TU Darmstadt, shall be made publicly available, provided that the research data generated with it can only be understood with it and no other reasons contradict a publication."
technical-university-of-darmstadt.md,"6. All research groups at TUDa strive to be up to date with regard to the rules, standards and recommendations for research data management that apply to their discipline. To this end, they appoint a scientific staff member as RDM officer who actively follows developments and supports the group members in research data management. The development of subjet-specific recommendations at the appropriate level (departments, institutes, etc.) is recommended."
technical-university-of-darmstadt.md,An RDM officer can also be appointed for several methodologically or disciplinary related disciplines. The RDM officers exchange information with each other at the appropriate level (at least in the department). TUdata supports the RDM officers and their networking.
technical-university-of-darmstadt.md,"7. When applying for external funding, the departments check what effort research data management will require in the project and what opportunities exist to raise corresponding funds from the funding agency."
technical-university-of-darmstadt.md,"8. Data literacy is a prerequisite for efficient and sustainable handling of research data and for compliance with good scientific practice. The methods of subject-specific research data management should therefore be appropriately anchored in teaching and continuing education. Due to the outstanding importance of today’s students for tomorrow’s science, the TU Darmstadt advocates the idea of “good research data management from the very beginning” and, in addition to teaching the theoretical basics at an early stage, strives for the continuous and practical application of the methods and tools in student internships and thesis projects."
technical-university-of-darmstadt.md,These guidelines were adopted by the Executive Board of the Technical University of Darmstadt on September 8th 2022 and become effective immediately.
technical-university-of-darmstadt.md,"These guidelines are regularly reviewed by the central institutions and committees involved to ensure that they are up to date and can be adapted to new requirements, infrastructural developments and the needs of researchers. Compliance with legal and regulatory standards (including data protection regulations) is checked regularly."

They are necessary to verify and defend the process and results of research. Research data have a long-term value for research and academia, with the potential for widespread use in society."
technical-university-vienna.md,### 2 Scope
technical-university-vienna.md,"This policy for the management of research data applies to all researchers active at TU Wien. The policy was approved by the Rectorate on 03.07.2018. In cases when research is funded by a third party3, any agreements made with that party concerning intellectual property rights (IPR), access rights, exploitation rights and the storage of research data take precedence over this policy."
technical-university-vienna.md,### 3 Rights of use
technical-university-vienna.md,"TU Wien holds the right to use all data created or processed in the course of research work at TU Wien for research purposes and commercial exploitation. In cases where a legal entity other than TU Wien has the primary right of use under a contractual arrangement, TU Wien shall be granted the rights of use required to ensure compliance with all applicable legal and contractual provisions. In cases where the IPR belong to TU Wien, TU Wien has the right to choose how to publish and share the research data."
technical-university-vienna.md,### 4 Research data and research data management
technical-university-vienna.md,"Research data refer to all information (regardless of form or presentation) needed to support or validate the development, results, observations or findings of research work, including contextual information. Research data include all materials created in the course of academic work, e.g. through digitisation, records, source research, experiments, measurements, surveys and interviews. This includes software and code."
technical-university-vienna.md,"Research data management spans the entire life cycle of the research data: their planning, generation, analysis, evaluation, archiving, publication and eventual reuse by third parties. Besides documenting the research data, RDM includes specifying – and possibly storing – the equipment and software employed in producing them. Metadata4 should be captured together with the research data during the research process, since they facilitate the identification, interpretation and reuse of research data."
technical-university-vienna.md,### 5 Handling research data
technical-university-vienna.md,Research data should from the beginning be stored and maintained in appropriate systems and made available for use in a suitable repository (see 6.1. b). Research data must be provided with persistent identifiers5 within the repository.
technical-university-vienna.md,"It is important to preserve the integrity of research data and to comply with the FAIR principles.6 Research data must be stored in a correct, complete, unadulterated, and reliable manner. They must be findable, identifiable, accessible, traceable, interoperable and whenever possible reusable and replicable."
technical-university-vienna.md,"In compliance with intellectual property rights, and unless third-party rights, legal requirements, Rectorate decisions, other reasonable interests or property laws prohibit it, research data should be assigned an open use license.7"
technical-university-vienna.md,Citation norms and requirements regarding publication and future research should be followed; data sources should be explicitly traceable in order for the original sources to be acknowledged.
technical-university-vienna.md,Research data and records are to be stored and made available in accordance with intellectual property laws or the requirements of third-party funders as well as applicable legal or contractual requirements (e.g. EU restrictions on where identifiable personal data may be stored). Research data that may be of future historical interest and the records accompanying them should also be archived.
technical-university-vienna.md,"The minimum retention period for research data and records is 10 years after either the assignment of a persistent identifier or the publication of a related work following research completion, whichever is later."
technical-university-vienna.md,"In the event that research data and records are to be deleted or destroyed, either after expiration of the required retention period or for legal or ethical reasons, such action is to be carried out only after consideration of all legal and ethical perspectives. The following aspects must be taken into consideration when decisions are made about the retention or destruction of research data: interests and contractual provisions of third-party funders and other stakeholders, employees, and partner participants in particular, as well as confidentiality and security. Any decision taken must be documented."

technische-universität-berlin-tu-berlin.md,"Contract research is scientific research carried out on behalf of a private or public funding organization. The task is predefined and the rights to the research results generally belong to the principal, whereby the University is granted a non-exclusive right of use for the purpose of research and teaching."
technische-universität-berlin-tu-berlin.md,"A data management plan (DMP) is a structured guideline on how to handle research data both during and after a research project. It documents the process how the research data is generated and how it is stored appropriately so that it can be interpreted and verified, and remains available, authentic, citable, and reusable in later years. To this end, clearly defined legal parameters and appropriate security measures (such as contracts and licenses) shall also be included in the DMP. To optimize research data management and as a basis for institutional support, a DMP should be created before the start of a research project and updated in the course of the project."
technische-universität-berlin-tu-berlin.md,"A repository is a storage platform for the archiving and worldwide publication of scientific publications, research data, or cultural heritage data. Storage of research results in a repository ensures that they are sustainably accessible, verifiable, citable, and reusable."
technische-universität-berlin-tu-berlin.md,"The FAIR principles are international principles for sustainably reusable research data. The main objective of the principles is to ensure that research data is optimally prepared so that it is findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. The FAIR principles were created and first published in 2016 by a broad-based interest group consisting of representatives from science, industry, funding organizations, and scientific publishers.9"

People who are not directly connected with TU Berlin but use its infrastructure or are physically present at the University for research purposes are included in this term. Visiting researchers and external cooperative partners are expected to comply with the Research Data Policy.
technische-universität-berlin-tu-berlin.md,"Research Data Management (RDM) encompasses all measures for the quality assurance of research data with regard to storage, access, and preservation of research data in order to make research results sustainably reproducible and available for reuse. The activities cover the entire research data lifecycle, starting with the planning and execution of the research project, through the creation and storing of data to the long-term storage of the results after the research project is completed. Specific tasks in RDM include quality control and quality assurance, documentation, metadata creation, archiving, data exchange and reuse as well as measures for data integrity and data security."
technische-universität-berlin-tu-berlin.md,"Cooperative research is cooperation on equal terms between partners pursuing a common goal. In principle, the rights to the results belong to the partner who developed them."
technische-universität-berlin-tu-berlin.md,"A licence for free use (or free license) is a standardized license agreement which allows research data to be reused. It regulates which rights of use the author/originator grants to the general public that go beyond the applicable copyright law. Depending on the data type, a license is selected. Established free licenses in software are the GNU General Public License (GPL), the MIT license, or the Apache license. Creative Common licenses (CC) apply to texts, images, music and videos."
technische-universität-berlin-tu-berlin.md,"Metadata is data about data. It is data which provides descriptive or contextual information about other data, can be indexed, and facilitates archiving and retrieval. There are different types or categories of metadata. Metadata in a repository, for example, can be classified in four types of content: bibliographic metadata (e.g. title, author, abstract), structural metadata (relationships between and within objects, e.g. links, references), administrative metadata (authorizations/status, e.g. access rights, embargo), technical metadata (data evaluated by the system, e.g. size of files, checksums, modification date)."
technische-universität-berlin-tu-berlin.md,"A persistent identifier is a constant Internet address for digital objects.

technische-universität-braunschweig.md,# Guidelines for Handling Research Data at Technische Universität Braunschweig
technische-universität-braunschweig.md,## Preamble
technische-universität-braunschweig.md,"Research data are data that are collected as part of scientific projects, e.g. through observations, experiments, simulation calculations, surveys, researching sources, recordings, digitalisation or analyses.1 They are both the basis for scientific work and its results. Responsible management of research data and the software that creates this data serves to ensure that the research can be reproduced and validated, and in some cases enables the research data to be used again. Technische Universität Braunschweig supports its researchers in implementing quality-conscious data management for the purpose of ensuring good scientific practice and to promote more transparency in their research."
technische-universität-braunschweig.md,# Principles
technische-universität-braunschweig.md,"1) The researching members of Technische Universität Braunschweig are responsible for deciding which data is worth being archived and published as well as for documenting, providing and long-term archiving of the research data. By saving and archiving the data in a recognised repository, researchers fulfil their requirement to adhere to good scientific practice (archiving for at least"
technische-universität-braunschweig.md,10 years).
technische-universität-braunschweig.md,"2) When managing research data, researchers ensure they adhere to ethical, data security, copyright or confidentiality principles."
technische-universität-braunschweig.md,"3) We recommend making research data and research software publicly available with an academic publication according to Technische Universität Braunschweig's open access guidelines.3 For this, it is recommended that researchers choose an open licence (e.g. Creative Commons) to make it easier for fellow researchers to use the data. This is done under consideration of requirements set by the research project's funding organisations and partners. FAIR Data Principles4 as well as software and data citation principles5 must be upheld."

technische-universität-dresden.md,These Guidelines have been adopted by the Senate of Technische Universität Dresden in its meeting on 13th June 2018.
technische-universität-dresden.md,### Preamble
technische-universität-dresden.md,The transparency of research is a key component of good scientific practice. It includes the responsible handling of research data as both the basis for one's own scientific research and the basis for further research - irrespective of the original purpose of data collection.
technische-universität-dresden.md,"In its 'Guidelines for Safeguarding Good Scientific Practice, Avoiding Scientific Misconduct and Dealing with Violations' (version of 5th March 2014), TU Dresden has stipulated guidelines for the handling of primary data in § 5. For the implementation of these guidelines and the handling of research data in general (i.e. beyond primary data), TU Dresden has adopted the following specific guidelines for the handling of research data."
technische-universität-dresden.md,#### What is research data?
technische-universität-dresden.md,"Research data refers to all data collected, observed, derived, simulated or otherwise generated in connection with research. Research data is present in any scientific discipline in different forms and formats."
technische-universität-dresden.md,### Guidelines
technische-universität-dresden.md,"1. Responsible research goes hand in hand with the conscious and careful handling of research data throughout its entire life cycle, as formulated by the German Research Foundation (DFG) in its 'Guidelines on the Handling of Research Data'. Research data management involves the planning, collection, processing, documentation, publication, and long-term storage of data."
technische-universität-dresden.md,"2. The responsibility for the research data management lies with the project leaders as well as the independent researchers. The structural units (Schools, Faculties or Institutes) can define binding rules for their areas of responsibility."
technische-universität-dresden.md,"3. For projects involving research data, a data management plan that documents the handling of research data should be established right at the project conception or application stage, based on general and subject-specific guidelines (e.g. of the funding bodies or professional associations)."
technische-universität-dresden.md,"4. TU Dresden supports its researchers in the management of their research data through the Service Center Research Data (Kontaktstelle Forschungsdaten), which is jointly operated by the ZIH and the SLUB. It offers advice regarding the development of concepts as well as assistance providing tools for research data management. To optimally benefit from this service, early contact prior to or at the beginning of a project is recommended."
technische-universität-dresden.md,"5. TU Dresden provides a basic research data infrastructure, ensuring appropriate storage and the technical availability of digital research data."
technische-universität-dresden.md,"6. TU Dresden promotes and supports Open Access to research data. This is good scientific practice and of great importance for both the optimal exploitation of research results and the quality of research. The decision for any publication and its legal conditions is the individual researcher’s responsibility. The protection of personal data, ethical and copyright issues, obligations towards third parties, and exploitation interests should be given balanced consideration."

teesside-university.md,## Introduction
teesside-university.md,"The principles of open science and engagement are central to Teesside University’s Research Strategy (2020-2025) and the University’s mission to generate and apply knowledge that contributes to the economic, social and cultural success of students, partners and the communities we serve."
teesside-university.md,"1.2 The University recognises the importance of good data management in assuring the integrity of its research and in supporting approaches to open science. It supports the principles of the Concordat on Open Research Data1 which state that ‘research data should, wherever possible be made openly available for use by others in a manner consistent with relevant legal, ethical, disciplinary and regulatory frameworks and norms’."
teesside-university.md,"1.3 To embed good practice in research and ensure research data are easily accessible, the University has developed this Research Data Management Policy in accordance with The Concordat on Open Research Data, Funder requirements, and best practice for research data management as set out in the LEARN2 Toolkit."
teesside-university.md,"1.4 The University’s position on related issues is set out in its policies for Open Access, Data Protection, Research Ethics, Freedom of Information and Information Security."
teesside-university.md,## 2 Scope
teesside-university.md,"This policy applies to all staff and students involved in the creation, collection and curation of research data at Teesside University; and all data generated or processed as part of research for which the University is responsible."
teesside-university.md,## 3. Definitions
teesside-university.md,"Research is any creative and systematically performed work with the goal of furthering knowledge, including discoveries regarding people, culture and society, in addition to the use of such knowledge for new applications."
teesside-university.md,"3.2 Researchers refers to all research-active members of an institution including employees and doctoral candidates. Persons not directly affiliated with an institution, but who, for purposes of research, make use of or are physically present at the institution, are also included in the term. Visiting researchers or collaborators may also be expected to comply with the policy."
teesside-university.md,"3.3 Research data refers to all information (independent of form or presentation) needed to support or validate the development, results, observations or findings of a research project, including contextual information. Research data include all materials which are created in the course of academic work, including digitisation, records, source research, experiments, measurements, surveys and interviews. This includes software and code. Research data can take on several forms during the lifespan of a research project. Data can exist as gradations of raw data, processed data (including negative and inconclusive results), published data and Open Access published data, and with varying levels of access, including open data, restricted data and closed data."
teesside-university.md,## 4 Planning
teesside-university.md,"All new research projects should include a research data management plan (DMP) which details approaches to the capture, management, integrity, confidentiality, retention, ownership, sharing and publication of research data. Compliance with relevant legal and ethical frameworks and funder requirements where relevant should be ensured.  A DMP must be developed where specified by a funder, sponsor or other relevant stakeholder, and is strongly encouraged as best practice for all projects."
teesside-university.md,"The University provides access to an online tool3 which can be used to create Data Management Plans if another tool, such as one provided by a funder, is not being used."
teesside-university.md,## 5 Storage and Management
teesside-university.md,"Research data should be stored and made available for use in a suitable repository or archiving system and provided with persistent identifiers. Research data should be stored on the University’s research data repository4, or a record should be created in the repository with a link to a suitable external repository, for example if it is felt that an external discipline-specific policy would give a dataset enhanced visibility or when the use of an external repository is required by an external funder."
teesside-university.md,"5.2 It is important to preserve the integrity of research data and they must be stored in a correct reliable manner. Data storage should follow FAIR data principles5 and must be identifiable, accessible, traceable, interoperable, and whenever possible, available for subsequent use."
teesside-university.md,5.3 Non-digital research data should be stored in a form that would allow for sharing and access if required. The fact that research data is non-digital does not provide a sufficient reason for restricting access.
teesside-university.md,"5.4 Research data must be assigned a licence for open use, in compliance with intellectual property rights, if no third-party rights, legal requirements or property laws prohibit it."
teesside-university.md,## 6 Retention
teesside-university.md,"Research data and records are to be stored and made available in accordance with the research data management plan, relevant"
teesside-university.md,"intellectual property laws, and/or the requirements of third-party funders, within the parameters of applicable legal or contractual requirements."
teesside-university.md,"6.2 The minimum archive duration for research data and records should be determined by best practice, discipline norms and stakeholder requirements where relevant.  In the absence of these, a general guideline is that data should be retained for 10 years after either the assignment of a persistent identifier or publication of related research results, whichever is later."
teesside-university.md,## 7 Disposal
teesside-university.md,"Research data should be disposed of securely, in accordance with the DMP and the University’s Information Security Policy.  The timing of data disposal should reflect any ethical, contractual and legal requirements, and current best practice."
teesside-university.md,"## Responsibilities, rights and duties"
teesside-university.md,8.1 Researchers are responsible for:
teesside-university.md,The development of the DMP.  Support is available from the Library and Research and Enterprise Office.
teesside-university.md,Management of research data and data sets in conjunction with the principles and requirements expressed in this policy.
teesside-university.md,"Planning for the curation and management of research data and related records, as reflected in the DMP"
teesside-university.md,"Compliance with the requirements of research funders; requirements for specific projects should be described in the DMP. When applying for funding, researchers must ensure that adequate resources to cover the costs associated with data management are requested where possible."
teesside-university.md,The most senior researcher associated with a research project (funded or unfunded) is the Data Lead and is ultimately responsible for research data management associated with the project.
teesside-university.md,o For funded projects this will be the Principal Investigator o For PGR students this will the Director of Studies.
teesside-university.md,The Data Lead must ensure that all researchers working on the project are aware of the requirements of this policy.
teesside-university.md,"If a researcher leaves the University, they should inform the Data Lead of any data they hold relating to a research project and arrange for the data to be made available to the Data Lead.  If the Data Lead leaves the University, they should discuss the research data they hold with their line manager or Associate Dean (Research and Innovation) and ensure that appropriate decisions are taken on the management of the research data.  This may include ensuring that funder requirements are met."
teesside-university.md,8.2 Teesside University is responsible for:
teesside-university.md,"Developing and providing mechanisms, services and infrastructure for the registration, storage, curation, and deposit of research data."
teesside-university.md,"Supporting the drafting, costing and provision of DMPs"

the-open-university.md,### Introduction
the-open-university.md,"Research data is defined as the evidence base on which academic researchers build their analytic or other work. Such data may be in any form, but may include “digital information created directly from research activities such as experiments, analysis, surveys, measurements, instrumentation and observations; data resulting from automated or manual data reduction and analysis including the inputs and outputs of simulations and models”2."
the-open-university.md,This policy defines the standards that govern the management of research data at the Open University.
the-open-university.md,"Research data management (RDM) is a recognised part of the research process and scholarly communications. Formal requirements and expectations from funders, publishers, collaborators and institutions (for example Data Management Plans and data sharing) exist and are likely to continue to evolve. There are benefits to the researcher, the University and the research community when research data is well managed, preserved and, where appropriate, made publicly available."
the-open-university.md,"For specific guidance on how this policy may relate to your personal circumstances, please contact the Library Research Support team library-research-support@open.ac.uk."
the-open-university.md,# Policy

the-university-of-edinburgh.md,# Research Data Management Policy
the-university-of-edinburgh.md,## Purpose of Policy
the-university-of-edinburgh.md,"The purpose of the policy, updated from 2011, is to make clear the responsibilities of the University and its researchers for managing research data well, in order to adhere to accepted good practice, advance the University’s Open Research strategy, and to provide linkages to other relevant university policies, such as the Data Protection Policy. Research data are both University assets and the underpinning of publications representing the scholarly record, which is public. As research culture changes, this policy will be regularly reviewed."
the-university-of-edinburgh.md,## Overview
the-university-of-edinburgh.md,"The current policy has been recognised nationally and internationally as an excellent example, being one of the first of its kind to be written and passed and has been a basis for many other UK universities to build upon. However, the passage of ten years means that important concepts such as FAIR1 and GDPR are missing; also review period and further context has been added."
the-university-of-edinburgh.md,"The University’s Research Data Service offers tools and support for managing data before, during and after data are generated by research projects (  The service is part of the broader Digital Research Services which acts as a single point of access to all of the data and computing services available to researchers at the University of Edinburgh, including the Edinburgh International Data Facility."
the-university-of-edinburgh.md,Scope: Mandatory Policy
the-university-of-edinburgh.md,"The policy applies to University researchers, defined as all academic staff and postgraduate research students (PGRs) and informs development of University data-related infrastructure and service."

the-university-of-edinburgh.md,# Research Data Management Policy
the-university-of-edinburgh.md,"This policy (version 2) supersedes and updates the first University of Edinburgh Research Data Management Policy passed by University Court in May, 2011.1 RDM refers to Research Data Management throughout."
the-university-of-edinburgh.md,## RDM and Research Integrity
the-university-of-edinburgh.md,"Research data processed by University researchers will be managed to a high standard throughout the research data lifecycle as part of the University’s commitment to research excellence. The definition of research data for the purpose of this policy is digital or analog information that is collected, observed, created or reused to produce, validate and enrich research findings and conclusions.2 The University of Edinburgh is committed to maintaining the highest standards of rigour and integrity in all aspects of its research.3 Research data management is a key component of research integrity. Research data management (RDM) refers to the organisation, storage and preservation of data created during a research project. It covers initial planning, day-to-day processes and long-term archiving and sharing, or deletion."
the-university-of-edinburgh.md,### Responsibilities for a research project’s data management
the-university-of-edinburgh.md,"Responsibility for managing data during any research project or programme lies with Principal Investigators (PIs) or individual researchers (academic staff or postgraduate research students) working on their own. When responsibility is delegated to data managers, the PI retains accountability, and is responsible as data owner (and data controller when personal data are collected) on behalf of the University. The PI should choose methods, platforms and services for managing data that are affordable through the research grant and comply with University policy and procedures, as well as their funder’s requirements and those of any external data controller. Researchers should be familiar with University RDM solutions as well as disciplinary tools and infrastructure available to them, including their full costs, terms and conditions, in order to make optimal choices for active and archived research data. This approach is commensurate with the University’s commitment to academic freedom. The researcher must comply with the University’s Information Security Policy and Data Protection Policy, as well as Finance regulations, policies and procedures.4"
the-university-of-edinburgh.md,"When a University researcher is collaborating with any external partner, they should agree between them the rights and responsibilities of each party with respect to data collected, including key decisions about data storage, backup and security, registration, access, transfer, retention, destruction or archiving and licensing. (See Rights section below for when data sharing agreements may be required)."
the-university-of-edinburgh.md,Research students who are responsible for their own research and the integrity of data they collect and use will be bound by the University’s policy and procedures.5
the-university-of-edinburgh.md,"The University is responsible for raising awareness of good practice and PIs’ and research students’ obligations with respect to research data, and provision of useful platforms, guidance, and services in support of current and future access, during and after completion of research projects, subject to necessary cost recovery from research funders through PIs’ grant proposals."
the-university-of-edinburgh.md,# Research Data Management Policy
the-university-of-edinburgh.md,## Research Data Management Plans
the-university-of-edinburgh.md,"Researchers must create a data management plan (DMP) at the time of their research proposal if any research data are to be collected or used. Plans should cover data types and volume, capture, storage, integrity, confidentiality, retention and destruction, sharing and deposit. A suggested minimum period of retention is three years from the end of the project, however requirements by funders and data providers, as well as disciplinary guidance should be observed."
the-university-of-edinburgh.md,"Research data management plans must specify how and when research data will be made available for access and reuse. Generally, accompanying research data should be made available as soon as findings are published, under appropriate safeguards when necessary. A Data Protection Impact Assessment is required whenever data pertaining to individuals is used.6 Research outputs which convey findings from research data should include a citation or data access statement which clearly provides a route for readers to obtain the data. When the researcher does not hold the intellectual property rights or have permission to make derived data available they must provide a citation or data access statement in relevant publications to the source of data."
the-university-of-edinburgh.md,"Costs such as extra storage, long-term retention, or data management effort must be addressed and included in the total cost to funders whose policies accept RDM costs. All UK Research and Innovation funders explicitly state that all costs associated with research data management are eligible under UKRI funding.7 The Edinburgh Research Office, school research support officers and the Information Services’ Research Data Service can provide indicative costs for University RDM services."
the-university-of-edinburgh.md,## FAIR data sharing
the-university-of-edinburgh.md,"The University supports the broad global consensus that publicly funded research data should be made openly available as soon as possible with as few restrictions as necessary.8 Additionally, many UK and international funders have embraced FAIR principles for data sharing (making data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable).9 FAIR acknowledges legitimate reasons for restricting access to data, such as confidentiality concerns, suggesting the need for information governance processes over usage when necessary.10 Principal Investigators and research students should consider how they can best make their data FAIR in their Data Management Plans."
the-university-of-edinburgh.md,"Discoverability and access by machines is considered as important as access by humans, in order to accelerate global science and progress Open Research. FAIR calls for the use of persistent identifiers, standard metadata, vocabularies and licences to allow researchers and computer programs to directly access and process data. An emphasis on reusability means that any relevant documentation, protocols, or designs which add context and usefulness to the data should be included with research data in repositories. Links to relevant publications, people, projects, and other research products such as software or source code should be provided in metadata records, with persistent identifiers when available."
the-university-of-edinburgh.md,"In some cases research products such as models and software code can be deposited with research data in data repositories. However, it may be more appropriate to utilise software"
the-university-of-edinburgh.md,# Research Data Management Policy
the-university-of-edinburgh.md,"repositories such as GitLab or GitHub, which offer the ability for partners or others to develop code into new directions while keeping track of versions. Research projects should plan for their software management as well as their data, and consider whether it will be made openly available (perhaps as open source software), and if so what licence is appropriate. In all cases code should be documented in a way that makes its functions transparent to improve quality and enable reuse of software and data. For long-lived projects software sustainability is another consideration which requires updating and refactoring over time."
the-university-of-edinburgh.md,"The University endorses the FAIR data sharing principles for maximising data reuse, and supports related initiatives such as DORA (Declaration on Research Assessment),11 ORCID (Open Researcher and Contributor ID),12 digital object identifiers (DOIs),13 and use of standard open licences for sharing research data and code."
the-university-of-edinburgh.md,## Data repositories
the-university-of-edinburgh.md,"Researchers are not expected to meet the FAIR principles on their own. Research data may be used for interdisciplinary research, may be of future historical interest, and all research data represent records of the University, including data that substantiate research findings. Therefore, appropriately documented research data must be offered for deposit and retention in an appropriate national or international data service or domain repository, or a University repository by PIs or their delegates.14"
the-university-of-edinburgh.md,"The University supports a free-at-point-of-use trustworthy digital repository for University research data which may be used by PIs and research students.15 A time-limited embargo may be used to ensure data are not made available before related publications, subject to funder mandates. Any data which are retained elsewhere, for example in an international data service or domain repository must be registered with the University.16 These external services may assess data for acceptance according to their criteria. Any lock-in to proprietary databases or unnecessary restrictions must be avoided. Research data which are being actively used for analysis not yet made available may be subject to Freedom of Information or other requests.17"
the-university-of-edinburgh.md,## Rights in research data
the-university-of-edinburgh.md,"In determining access rights for research data the legitimate interests of the subjects of research data must be protected. The rights of citizen scientists and the public to access publicly funded research should be considered as well.18 When open access to datasets is not legal or ethical, information governance restrictions on access and use must be applied as necessary."
the-university-of-edinburgh.md,"Written agreements are required when personal data (any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person) is passed from a data controller to a data processor or another data controller, or to a country not bound by the General Data Protection Regulation or equivalent privacy legislation. Written agreements are also useful when the data being shared although not personal data, are confidential or valuable to the parties involved.  The University’s Research Office can assist with providing templates for both incoming and outgoing research data and the drafting and negotiation of the agreements concerned.19"
the-university-of-edinburgh.md,"Exclusive rights to reuse or publish research data must not be passed to commercial publishers or agents without retaining the rights to make the data openly available for reuse, unless this is a condition of funding."
the-university-of-edinburgh.md,## Review
the-university-of-edinburgh.md,"This policy shall be reviewed every five years or when significant changes are required, whichever is sooner. The review will be initiated by Library Research Support in consultation with relevant governance bodies. College Research Committees must be consulted; the Research Strategy Group or equivalent body will grant approval."

the-university-of-exeter.md,## Context
the-university-of-exeter.md,The “Open Research” landscape – comprising Open Access publishing and Open Data – has altered substantially since the University’s Open Access Research and Research Data Management Policy was put in place in 2013 and continues to evolve. The University recognises that the transition to Open Access continues to require significant cultural change.
the-university-of-exeter.md,"The University of Exeter recognises that Open Access to both research papers and research data allows greater visibility of research and can stimulate new research opportunities and collaborations. Making research papers and data Open Access has been shown to increase citations. Re-use of data can lead to new research opportunities, building on existing research to further discovery."
the-university-of-exeter.md,### The University of Exeter’s preferred means for sharing research freely and openly is through self- archiving (the so-called “green” route to Open Access) via the institutional repository (Open Research Exeter – ORE).
the-university-of-exeter.md,The University also supports “easy access” IP and other emerging areas that are part of the “open” landscape.
the-university-of-exeter.md,The University of Exeter is committed to complying with funders’ policies and recognises that the academic community requires support in interpreting and observing sometimes conflicting policies.
the-university-of-exeter.md,"The University’s Open Access Research and Research Data Management Policy supports the HEFCE and RCUK position that publicly funded research is a public good that should be made openly available to the public when legally, commercially and ethically appropriate. This policy is designed to help support researchers comply with funding bodies’ requirements on Open Access to research papers and on research data management. This is paramount as the University risks loss of income if it fails to satisfy funders’ expectations in this area."
the-university-of-exeter.md,"The University recognises that good practice in research data management is a key part of research excellence. Research data are the evidence that underpins the answer to the research question, and can be used to validate findings regardless of its form (e.g. print, digital, or physical)1. These might be quantitative information or qualitative statements collected by researchers in the course of their work by experimentation, observation, modelling, interview or other methods, or information derived from existing evidence. They may include, for example, experimental measurements, predictions from models, statistics, collections"
the-university-of-exeter.md,"of digital images, sound recordings, transcripts of interviews, survey data and fieldwork observations with appropriate annotations, an interpretation, an artwork, archives, found objects, published texts or a manuscript."
the-university-of-exeter.md,"Research data are a valuable asset. It is the collaborative responsibility of researchers and the institution that they are appropriately managed and stored both during and after the research process: to meet legislative, funder, information governance and University requirements; to facilitate data security (confidentiality, integrity, availability); to facilitate appropriate access, collaboration and sharing of data and results.  Good research data management brings benefits to the researcher, the University and the wider community. Examples of such benefits include ensuring that research data is stored safely thus avoiding data loss, the possibility of validating research findings and the ability to reuse and share data sets."
the-university-of-exeter.md,The following policy sets out the University’s expectations on Open Access and research data management.
the-university-of-exeter.md,# Policy
the-university-of-exeter.md,"1. The University of Exeter supports the principles of Open Access to research papers and, where legally, commercially and ethically appropriate, to the research data of its research community."
the-university-of-exeter.md,"2. The scope of these principles apply to all research conducted at the University, regardless of funding source. They do not imply additional compliance where good practice and relevant research funders’ requirements are already being followed."
the-university-of-exeter.md,"3. Researchers should always comply with funder policy, and any relevant contractual requirements, on Open Access publishing and research data management."
the-university-of-exeter.md,"4. The University is responsible for ensuring that appropriate systems are in place to enable management of open access processes, taking advantage of national developments in this area as they emerge."
the-university-of-exeter.md,"5. The University is responsible for the provision of training, support and advice on Open Access and research data management as well as the provision of a backed-up storage service for completed digital research data and for Open Access research papers."
the-university-of-exeter.md,## Open Access publishing
the-university-of-exeter.md,6. Lead/corresponding authors are responsible for complying with funder and University policy on Open Access research publications.
the-university-of-exeter.md,"7. In line with HEFCE’s REF Open Access policy, all researchers should deposit the research papers they produce (journal articles and conference proceedings with an ISSN) whilst employed at the University in the institutional repository, Open Research Exeter (ORE), within three months of acceptance for publication. Embargo periods should not exceed 6 months for Biomedicine, 12 months for STEM disciplines and 24 months for HASS disciplines, in accordance with research funder requirements."
the-university-of-exeter.md,"8. Where the lead/corresponding author is at another UK institution, overseas institution or is a PhD student or postdoctoral research assistant, Exeter authors are expected to make reasonable efforts to ensure that manuscripts are deposited in a timely manner."
the-university-of-exeter.md,"9. Authors of other output types (for example, monographs) are encouraged to pursue an open access or open source publication route where possible and practical."
the-university-of-exeter.md,## Research data management
the-university-of-exeter.md,10. Responsibility for research data management during any research project lies jointly with Principal Investigators (PIs) and researcher(s).
the-university-of-exeter.md,11. Published research papers should include a short statement describing how and on what terms any supporting research data may be accessed.
the-university-of-exeter.md,"12. There is a presumption of open access to data held in a University or other public repository. However, access may be restricted, subject to a time embargo or not permitted for legal (i.e. intellectual property, data protection, confidentiality, contractual requirements), ethical or commercial reasons."
the-university-of-exeter.md,"13. At all stages of the research process, researchers are responsible for adherence to ethical principles, conditions of ethical or regulatory approvals, research governance requirements or legal agreements, such as terms of use set by providers of datasets."
the-university-of-exeter.md,"14. Researchers are expected to abide by the principles of information governance and to undertake training where required. Researchers are responsible for compliance with the requirements of the Data Protection Act 1998 and for the creation of metadata and other documentation that enables data to be discoverable, understandable and re-useable."
the-university-of-exeter.md,15. RCUK accept that research data management is a valid cost for research proposals. Principal Investigators should ensure that research data management requirements are costed into research proposals for all RCUK proposals and for other funders where allowable.
the-university-of-exeter.md,"16. To allow for institutional planning on infrastructure and research support, and the validation of existence of appropriate plans to support monitoring of compliance with funder requirements, all research proposals must include research data management plans that address the capture, management, integrity, confidentiality, security, selection, preservation and disposal, commercialisation, costs, sharing and publication of research data and the production of descriptive metadata to aid discovery and re-use when relevant. These should be stored in a sensible and accessible location, ideally alongside other project documentation."
the-university-of-exeter.md,"17. Data should be actively managed by researchers throughout the project, by following and updating the data management plan with ongoing decisions regarding retention and destruction."
the-university-of-exeter.md,"18. When research is complete, researchers are responsible for ensuring that research data (including websites) of long term value, or data required by funders or the University, are considered for retention, preservation and curation by offering such data for assessment, deposit and preservation in an appropriate University, national or international data service or domain repository, unless specified otherwise in the data management plan."
the-university-of-exeter.md,19. The University is responsible for ensuring safe storage of this data and is responsible for curation of this data in particular instances (i.e. health/social care research and clinical trials) where the University is sponsoring a study and agrees to take responsibility for archiving data.
the-university-of-exeter.md,"20. All research data selected for retention should be registered with the University’s data repository, even if the data is retained in a national or international data service or domain repository or if the data is not suitable for publishing on Open Access."
the-university-of-exeter.md,"21. Data selected for retention should not be deposited with any organisation that does not commit to its access and availability for re-use, unless this is a condition of funding or would prevent commercial interests."
the-university-of-exeter.md,"22. After the deposit of data with a repository, the repository is responsible for the on-going management of that data in accordance with legal, technical and other requirements. However, researchers should ensure that they are satisfied with the sustainability of the repository."
the-university-of-exeter.md,"23. The University is responsible for the provision of sustainable, secure solutions that meet the requirements for long term data storage, discovery and re-use as set out in these principles."
the-university-of-exeter.md,## Funding arrangements
the-university-of-exeter.md,Authors are encouraged to consider the discount publishing and subscription off-set arrangements in place via the Library which enable gold Open Access publishing at no cost to the researcher.
the-university-of-exeter.md,"The University will fund the gold Open Access publishing route where required for all RCUK funded research and research funded by the Wellcome Trust (and other charities that contribute to the Charities Open Access Fund), subject to availability of funds."
the-university-of-exeter.md,"Researchers funded through European Union Framework Programme 7 and Horizon 2020 are encouraged to recoup the costs (or part of the costs) for publishing in fully Open Access journals, subject to terms and conditions and availability of funds."
the-university-of-exeter.md,Principal Investigators must ensure that the costs for publication of research are included in research applications to other funding bodies. Researchers are also encouraged to check with their funders for provision of funding after the end of their grant.
the-university-of-exeter.md,Limited institutional funding for publications arising from research funded by other bodies is available.
the-university-of-exeter.md,Authors wishing to apply for APC funding must contact the Library before submitting their articles.

This policy supersedes and updates the first research data management policy of June 2011.  This policy will be reviewed by the Research, Impact and Innovation Committee on a yearly basis or amended in response to changes in the scholarly landscape, future legislation and/or case law."
the-university-of-northampton.md,## 2.0 OWNERSHIP
the-university-of-northampton.md,Research Support owns and manages this policy on behalf of The University of Northampton.
the-university-of-northampton.md,## 3.0 ORGANISATIONAL SCOPE
the-university-of-northampton.md,"This Research Data Management policy is a corporate policy and applies to all employees (and workers, as applicable) of The University of Northampton including any wholly owned subsidiaries, unless an alternative policy exists, subject to any qualifying conditions."
the-university-of-northampton.md,## 4.0 POLICY STATEMENT
the-university-of-northampton.md,4.1 The University of Northampton recognises that good research is underpinned by good research data management.
the-university-of-northampton.md,The UON Research Ethics Code & Procedures defines ‘failures to adhere to UON policy and/or funder requirements in relation to open access and good data management’ as a form of research misconduct. The Research Misconduct Policy outlines the University of Northampton’s powers and procedures in the event of allegations of research misconduct by staff or students.
the-university-of-northampton.md,This policy specifically covers research data management for all UON Staff and doctoral students at Levels 7 and 8. Principles of good data management should be a required element of research training at Levels 4-6.
the-university-of-northampton.md,a) Integrity
the-university-of-northampton.md,"Research data that is generated and used by University researchers will be managed to a high standard throughout the research data lifecycle as part of the University’s commitment to research excellence. The definition of research data for the purpose of this policy is digital or analogue information that is collected, observed, created or reused to produce, validate and enrich research findings and conclusions."
the-university-of-northampton.md,"Research data management (RDM) refers to the organisation, storage and preservation of data created throughout a research project."
the-university-of-northampton.md,### b) Responsibility
the-university-of-northampton.md,Responsibility for managing data is the Principal Investigators (PIs) or individual researchers (this includes all staff and doctoral students) working on their own.
the-university-of-northampton.md,"All staff and students engaged in research should be familiar with the University’s research data management solutions as well as disciplinary/subject specific tools and infrastructure that may be available. The researcher (person undertaking the research and/or managing a research project) must comply with the University’s Information Security Policy, Intellectual Property Policy and Data Protection Policy, as well as Finance regulations, policies and procedures."
the-university-of-northampton.md,"When a researcher from University of Northampton (UON) is collaborating with any external partner, they should agree between them the rights and responsibilities of each party with respect to data collected, including key decisions about data storage, backup and security, registration, access, transfer, retention, destruction or archiving and licensing. (See Rights section below for when data sharing agreements may be required)."
the-university-of-northampton.md,### Funded Research
the-university-of-northampton.md,"The PI/Researcher should choose methods, platforms and services for managing data that are affordable through their research grant (if applicable) and comply with University policy and procedures, as well as their funder’s requirements and those of any external data controller."
the-university-of-northampton.md,"In accordance with the recommendations of Research Councils UK, the University of Northampton expects researchers to:"
the-university-of-northampton.md,keep clear and accurate records of the research procedures followed and the results
the-university-of-northampton.md,"obtained, including interim results"
the-university-of-northampton.md,hold records securely in paper or electronic form
the-university-of-northampton.md,make relevant primary data and research evidence accessible to others for reasonable
the-university-of-northampton.md,periods after the completion of the research - data should normally bepreserved and
the-university-of-northampton.md,accessible for at least 10 years from the date of last use
the-university-of-northampton.md,"manage data according to the research funder’s data policy, best ethical practice and all"
the-university-of-northampton.md,relevant legislation
the-university-of-northampton.md,"To meet these expectations, the Principal Investigator/Researcher is, prior to applying for ethical approval, required to produce and then follow a research data management plan PMP). The DMP Online tool has been provided for staff and students at UON to use and is recommended for this purpose."
the-university-of-northampton.md,### 4.2 Research data management procedure
the-university-of-northampton.md,"At the start of every funded project, the researcher or lead researcher if part of a group will produce a DMP in line with the funder's specific requirements, or if no requirements are specified by the funder, then in accordance with the good practice described by DMP Online."
the-university-of-northampton.md,"DMPs should cover data types and volume, capture, storage, integrity, confidentiality, retention and destruction, sharing and deposit. A suggested minimum period of retention is ten years from the end of the project, however requirements by funders and data providers, as well as disciplinary guidance should be observed."
the-university-of-northampton.md,"DMPs must specify how and when research data will be made available for access and reuse.  Underpinning research data should be made available as soon as findings are published, under appropriate safeguards when necessary.  Academics may choose to have six months (STEM)/12 month (HAS) embargo period applied to the data.  A risk assessment is required whenever data pertaining to individuals is used. This must be approved by the relevant Research Ethical Committee prior to research commencing. Research outputs that convey findings from research data must include a data access statement that clearly provides directions for readers to obtain the data or a statement as to why the data is not available (e.g., commercial sensitivity)."
the-university-of-northampton.md,"Costs such as extra storage, long-term retention, or data management effort must be addressed and included in costings to funders whose policies accept RDM costs. Note - All UK Research and Innovation funders explicitly state that all costs associated with research data management are eligible under UKRI funding."
the-university-of-northampton.md,The Principal Investigator/Researcher will be responsible for ensuring that the actions outlined in the DMP are carried out.
the-university-of-northampton.md,At the end of a project data will be deposited in the university's secure central storage solution.  Complete datasets are to be uploaded to the Universities current research information system (Pure) to enable the research support team to deposit this in the university’s secure storage solution (Arkivum). The data must include appropriate
the-university-of-northampton.md,"descriptive metadata and, if necessary, accompanying explanatory documentation."
the-university-of-northampton.md,"Datasets within the university's central storage solution will be subject to review after ten years following date of deposit. The review will be undertaken by the researcher and the Head of Research Support. In the absence of the original researcher, an appropriate academic colleague will conduct the review with the Head of Research Support."
the-university-of-northampton.md,"If required as a result of the review, data may be securely destroyed or kept for a further ten-year period."
the-university-of-northampton.md,4.2 Rights to use and access research data
the-university-of-northampton.md,"In determining access rights for research data, the legitimate interests of the subjects of research data must be protected. The rights of the public to access publicly funded research should also be considered. When open access to datasets is not legal or ethical, information governance restrictions on access and use must be applied as necessary."
the-university-of-northampton.md,"Written agreements are required when personal data (any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person) is passed from a data controller to a data processor or another data controller, or to a country not bound by the General Data Protection Regulation or equivalent privacy legislation. Written agreements are also useful when the data being shared although not personal data, are confidential or valuable to the parties involved."
the-university-of-northampton.md,Exclusive rights to reuse or publish research data must not be passed to commercial publishers or agents without retaining the rights to make the data openly available for reuse unless this is a condition of funding.
the-university-of-northampton.md,### 4.3 Solutions for Data Management at UON
the-university-of-northampton.md,"Researchers have access to active research project space on sharepoint (each project should have a minimum of two spaces (contact research lead to arrange). Datasets should be deposited in PURE (or a link in PURE to the dataset in an existing data repository (e.g., Figshare or another Universities repository) on completion of research project, prior to the submission of any research outputs for publication."
the-university-of-northampton.md,"Long term digital preservation is achieved through Akivum, which is manged by the Research Support Team, who will action after dataset has been deposited in PURE."

the-university-of-northampton.md,## 6.0 KEY PRINCIPLES
the-university-of-northampton.md,"The University supports the broad global consensus that publicly funded research data should be made openly available as soon as possible and with as few restrictions as necessary.  Many UK and international funders have embraced FAIR principles for data sharing (making data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable).  FAIR acknowledges legitimate reasons for restricting access to data, such as confidentiality concerns.  Principal Investigators/Researchers and research students should consider how they can best make their data FAIR in their Data Management Plans."
the-university-of-northampton.md,"Discoverability and access by machines are considered as important as access by humans. FAIR encourages the use of persistent identifiers, standard metadata, vocabularies, and licences to allow researchers and computer programs to directly access and process data. An emphasis on reusability means that any relevant documentation, protocols, or designs which add context and usefulness to the data should be included with research datasets in repositories (Pure).  Links to relevant publications, people, projects, and other research products such as software or source code should be provided in metadata records, with persistent identifiers when available."
the-university-of-northampton.md,"In some cases, research products such as models and software code can be deposited with research data in data/subject repositories. However, it may be more appropriate to utilise software repositories such as GitLab or GitHub, which offer the ability for partners or others to develop code into new directions while keeping track of versions. Research projects should plan for their software management as well as their data and consider whether it will be made openly available and if so, what licence is appropriate. In all cases code should be documented in a way that makes its functions transparent to improve quality and enable reuse of software and data. For long-lived projects software sustainability is a further consideration which requires updating and refactoring over time."
the-university-of-northampton.md,"The University endorses the FAIR data sharing principles for maximising data reuse, and supports related initiatives such as DORA (Declaration on Research Assessment), ORCID (Open Researcher and Contributor ID), digital object identifiers (DOIs), and use of standard open licences for sharing research data and code."

tilburg-university.md,# Research Data Management Regulation
tilburg-university.md,## Introduction
tilburg-university.md,"Research data are of great value to Tilburg University and should be managed in a responsible manner. Responsible research data management is essential, from the principles of ‘scrupulousness and transparency’ as stated in ‘The Netherlands Code of Conduct for Research Integrity’. Furthermore, it is in line with the conditions of national and European research funders to stimulate open science and reuse of research data."
tilburg-university.md,"‘The Netherlands Code of Conduct for Research Integrity’ denominates the institutions’ duties of care to promote and maintain compliance with the code. The Tilburg University Strategy emphasizes the importance of research integrity, and encourages researchers to make their data and research materials publicly available if possible."
tilburg-university.md,"Although managing research data may vary considerably across research disciplines, the Executive Board chooses to offer one university-wide Research Data Management Regulation, in which the joint principles for responsible management of research data are stated. The aim of research data management is to guarantee accessibility to research data and protection of research data against theft, misuse, damage, and loss. The researcher should take care to adequately store and archive his/her research data, and make them retrievable and accessible. Responsible data storage leads to transparency (e.g. allowing other researchers to check published results) and offers possibilities for knowledge dissemination, meta-analysis, and reanalysis. Schools will specify the Research Data Management Regulation in an operating procedure for their School, tailored to the specific circumstances of the research discipline in question and internal School processes."
tilburg-university.md,## 1. Framework
tilburg-university.md,"The research data generated at Tilburg University are stored, managed, and made accessible in accordance with the legal demands (copyright act, privacy act etc.) developed to this purpose, and the relevant codes of conduct:"

tilburg-university.md,## Readers’ Guide
tilburg-university.md,"This guideline elaborates on a number of practical points from the Research Data Management Regulation. The guideline serves, on the one hand, as an aid for Schools in the development of School policy and, on the other hand, as an explanation of Article 8 (Personal Data) and Article 9 (Third Parties) of the Research Data Management Regulation."
tilburg-university.md,The guideline offers:
tilburg-university.md,1. an overview of items that may be part of a School data management policy (the checklists in Chapters 1 through 4);
tilburg-university.md,"2. instructions for dealing with the obligations of the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 which entered into force on May 1, 2018 if research is carried out with personal data (Chapters 5 and 6);"
tilburg-university.md,3. Explanation of the support services for research data management via the Research Data Office (RDO) (Chapter 7).
tilburg-university.md,Information on the School policies is available on the university’s intranet:
tilburg-university.md,### 1. Data Management Plan
tilburg-university.md,"A data management plan (DMP) is a digital document in which the researcher describes what data he or she will collect during a research project, how he or she will store and manage the data during the project, and what will happen to the data after the project has ended. The DMP is drawn up at the start of a new research project. Various models (templates) and checklists are available for drawing up a data management plan, often provided by the research institute or funding agency. The completed template forms the data management plan. During the course of the project, regular checks are carried out to ensure that the plan is still up to date or needs to be adjusted."
tilburg-university.md,The Research Data Management Regulation requires that a data management plan is written at the start of each new research project or program. In the School’s data management policy the following matters can be agreed:
tilburg-university.md,Who draws up the data management plan for a project?
tilburg-university.md,"For which type of research should a data management plan be drawn up? (for example, projects of PhD candidates and research funded by the NWO or other research funds); How is the drafting of data management plans supervised? To whom should a data management plan be submitted? For information or consent?"
tilburg-university.md,How is the updating of data management plans monitored?
tilburg-university.md,"Are data management plans stored centrally? If so, where? and who has access to it? Which matters that appear in a data management plan can be arranged at the level of the School or institute?"
tilburg-university.md,More information on data management plans on the university intranet:
tilburg-university.md,### Template Tilburg University
tilburg-university.md,"Tilburg University offers researchers an “Integrated form for Ethics, Data Management, and the Data Processing Register”. The form differs slightly for each school and can be obtained via the data representative of each School."
tilburg-university.md,Many topics that are listed in the Chapters 1 through 4 are covered in this form.
tilburg-university.md,## 2. Roles and Responsibilities
tilburg-university.md,"Persons who (may) play an advisory, supporting, operational, or supervisory role in research data management:"
tilburg-university.md,"a. Domain chairperson, research director"
tilburg-university.md,b. Director of the School or Research Institute
tilburg-university.md,c. Research leader (principal researcher)

tilburg-university.md,g. Data steward
tilburg-university.md,h. Ethics Committee
tilburg-university.md,i. Policy officer
tilburg-university.md,j. Secretary’s office
tilburg-university.md,The School data management policy may describe who has what responsibilities or duties in dealing with research data within the School or Research Institute.
tilburg-university.md,### Explanation Data Steward
tilburg-university.md,"A data steward1 is an official, usually a researcher, who is responsible for the research data management in one or more research projects. He/she is responsible for the development and alignment of the Research Data Management regulation implementation and advises researchers on the collection, storage, archiving and reuse of data at the School. This can pertain to data in research projects of staff and PhD projects. The research director, the head of the research group, the principal researcher (leader of the research project) or a lector can fulfil the role of data steward, and he or she can delegate tasks to one or more others. A data steward can also be a separate function."
tilburg-university.md,"If desired, the position of data steward can be further defined in the School’s data management policy, for example, by recording the following matters:"
tilburg-university.md,Who designates the data steward? Who can fulfill the role of data steward?
tilburg-university.md,"What is the scope of the position: per research project, research group, School/Researc"
tilburg-university.md,Institute?
tilburg-university.md,What are the duties of the data steward?
tilburg-university.md,What are the powers of the data steward?
tilburg-university.md,"Can the data steward delegate duties? If so, which and to whom?"
tilburg-university.md,To whom does the data steward report? In what form? With what frequency?
tilburg-university.md,How is continuity guaranteed when a data steward leaves?
tilburg-university.md,"## 3. Rules and Agreements on Storage, Access, and Archiving"
tilburg-university.md,### Storage
tilburg-university.md,"There are countless ways to lose data: a file is accidentally deleted, a laptop is stolen, the context of the data is unclear, software becomes unusable, a file can no longer be opened, etcetera. It is, therefore, important that every researcher pays attention to storing, organizing, and describing his or her data. It is also good to make agreements about this at the level of the School, Department, or Research Institute. The following could be considered:"
tilburg-university.md,How do you organize the safe collection of research data?
tilburg-university.md,Where are data stored for ongoing research?
tilburg-university.md,How are data stored?
tilburg-university.md,How is it organized that the raw data file cannot be changed after storage?
tilburg-university.md,"How are the data protected against loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized access?"
tilburg-university.md,"How is it ensured that it is clear, at all times, which processing the data have undergone? How is version management handled?"
tilburg-university.md,"What agreements apply to non-digital data and documentation? How is the connection between non-digital and digital data guaranteed? This includes, for example, completed Informed Consent forms, but also samples, models, etc."
tilburg-university.md,More information about storing research data during research on the university intranet:
tilburg-university.md,### Access
tilburg-university.md,#### Ongoing research
tilburg-university.md,"Data from ongoing research will of course be accessible to the researcher(s) directly involved, but there are more parties for whom access to the data may be necessary. In the School’s operating procedure/policy, it can be described:"
tilburg-university.md,Who have access to data from current research? This includes students who participate in the research project; the data steward; an ethics committee; a fellow researcher who must continue the research if the original researcher unexpectedly drops out; How is this access organized? By whom is access granted?
tilburg-university.md,#### Completed research
tilburg-university.md,Tilburg University is committed to ensuring that data from completed research is publicly accessible and available for reuse in new research. Researchers can ensure this by placing their data after completion of a research project in a data archive that offers the possibility of publishing the data
tilburg-university.md,and assigning a persistent identifier to the data (a unique code used to refer/link to the dataset) (see also the section on archiving). Tilburg University offers its researchers the institutional data repository DataverseNL. Tilburg University Dataverse has obtained the CoreTrustSeal quality mark.
tilburg-university.md,"Datasets containing sensitive data―intellectual property rights of third parties, personal data, corporate information, information that can cause damage when made public―cannot be made freely available. However, these data may be useful for new research. For many data archives it is possible to publish a description of this data and to make the data available only on request."
tilburg-university.md,"If an external party outside the regular scientific process submits a request for access to research data, the researcher can contact the Research Data Office for legal advice. This is to prevent that datasets are provided in violation of the rights of third parties. Conditions may be attached to the consent."
tilburg-university.md,"Before the researcher decides to file his/her dataset publicly, he/she will also consider whether the dataset may have commercial value. If so, the researcher may decide to file the dataset with restricted/monitored access."
tilburg-university.md,The following points can be included in the School’s operating procedure/policy:
tilburg-university.md,Which data are made publicly accessible? Which data are not?
tilburg-university.md,When will data suitable for this purpose be made publicly accessible? Who monitors this?
tilburg-university.md,How are data made publicly accessible? Does the School or Research Institute prefer a
tilburg-university.md,"particular data archive? If so, which one?"
tilburg-university.md,Under which license are data made public?
tilburg-university.md,Who handles requests for access to non-public data?
tilburg-university.md,What are the criteria for granting/rejecting requests for access to non-public data?
tilburg-university.md,More information about publishing research data can be found on the university intranet:
tilburg-university.md,### Archiving
tilburg-university.md,"The Research Data Management Regulation requires the storage of research data. For raw and processed research data, a storage period of at least ten years applies. Archiving is done in such a way that the data can be consulted with a minimum of time and action by the researcher him-/herself and by any other researchers (external or otherwise) who wish to use the data for new research."
tilburg-university.md,"In the School’s operating procedure/policy practical matters can be arranged, such as:"
tilburg-university.md,What data are archived? What are the criteria for archiving?
tilburg-university.md,Where are data archived and by whom?
tilburg-university.md,How are the data archived? What are the requirements for the description of the data
tilburg-university.md,(metadata)?
tilburg-university.md,Who oversees archiving and storage periods?
tilburg-university.md,Who decides whether to extend the storage period?
tilburg-university.md,What criteria are used to determine whether the storage period is extended?
tilburg-university.md,What happens to data for which the storage period is not extended?
tilburg-university.md,"What happens to data from researchers leaving the School or Research Institute? Are researchers who are no longer attached to the School or the Research Institute informed about the extension of the storage period or the destruction of data they have collected? If so, how, when, and by whom?"

tilburg-university.md,"The School’s operating procedure/policy may describe which support, education, and training will be arranged for whom, and by whom. For example:"
tilburg-university.md,(additional) training of researchers training and supervision of PhD candidates ▪ training and guidance of students training of data steward(s) practical support
tilburg-university.md,## 5. Rules and Agreements with Third Parties
tilburg-university.md,"It is also important that research data are handled carefully in accordance with the Research Data Management Regulation when collaborating with or conducting research on behalf of a third party. However, third parties are not necessarily bound by the Research Data Management Regulations. Third parties may be bound by internal regulations of their own institution or organization. It is, therefore, important that the subject of data management is part of the agreements made prior to the research and that these agreements are added to the collaboration agreement or commission agreement."
tilburg-university.md,"Students are also considered as third parties in this respect. If a student participates in a research under the responsibility of a Tilburg University researcher, the researcher will have to ensure that the student signs a statement in which he/she declares that he/she is familiar with the Research Data Management Regulations and will act in accordance with them. A standard model for such a statement is available."
tilburg-university.md,"In the event that the research data contain personal data, it may be necessary to conclude a socalled processor agreement. In many cases, the use of software and/or tools for the storage and/or collection of research data must also be based on a processor agreement with the owner of the software and/or tools. This also applies if a third party collects and/or stores the data on behalf of the researcher."
tilburg-university.md,"Also see: ""Rules and agreements in case research data contain personal data and third parties"" (page 15)."
tilburg-university.md,## 6. Rules and Agreements with Respect to Personal Data
tilburg-university.md,"If personal data is used for research purposes, a researcher encounters the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (GDPR), which imposes additional rules and obligations."
tilburg-university.md,"The ""VSNU Code of Conduct for the Use of Personal Data in Scientific Research"" (hereinafter referred to as the ""Code of Conduct for the Use of Personal Data"") is a translation of the GDPR for societal and behavioral science research. This Code of Conduct for the Use of Personal Data gives the researcher a practical assessment framework on how to handle personal data with care. In the Code of Conduct, personal data is defined as any data relating to an identified or identifiable natural person, i.e. any data that, without disproportionate time or effort, can lead to the identification of a natural person. Personal data are either directly identifying (personal) data or not directly identifying (personal) data."
tilburg-university.md,It is not the intention to discuss the Code of Conduct in its entirety here. Only the starting points for the standard cases are mentioned here:
tilburg-university.md,"Gedragscode persoonsgegevens in wetenschappelijk onderzoek, VSNU, december 2005 (Dutch"
tilburg-university.md,only)
tilburg-university.md,(NB the sections and page numbers mentioned here refer to the text of the Code of Conduct for the
tilburg-university.md,"Use of Personal Data) Only use lawfully collected data obtained with the consent of the respondent for a research. Exceptions are possible (see Section 3.3 onwards on page 12 of the Code of Conduct for the Use of Personal Data). Collect data sparingly: no more personal data may be collected than is necessary for the research; anonymous data should be used if possible; personal data will only be processed if there is no other option (see Section 3.2 on pages 11–12 and page 25 onwards of the Code of Conduct for the Use of Personal Data). When processing directly identifying data, two files should be created (communication data and research data). Linking takes place via an empty administration number and the access rules for the files must differ (see Section 3.6, page 13 and page 27 of the Code of Conduct for the Use of Personal Data)."
tilburg-university.md,"Personal data must be protected during processing and storage so that unauthorized persons (those not involved in the research) cannot have access to them (see Chapter 4, page 15, page 29, and page 30 of the Code of Conduct for the Use of Personal Data). Publication may only be made if this cannot be traced back to persons."
tilburg-university.md,### Transparency: report to the Data Protection Officer and schedule
tilburg-university.md,"If the research consists of processing data that can be directly or indirectly traced back to a natural person, the researcher must fill in the ""Integrated form for Ethics (if applicable), Data Management and the Data Processing Register”. The form helps to map out the processing operations that will take place for the purpose of the research. The completed schedule should then be sent to the appropriate email address of the School (see the overview of Ethics Review Boards of each School)."
tilburg-university.md,"On the basis of the completed inventory schedule, the Data Protection Officer, if necessary in consultation with Legal Affairs, can advise on compliance with the legal conditions for the protection of personal data and the Code of Conduct. It can also be tested whether further assessment of the security measures by the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) of LIS is desirable."
tilburg-university.md,"It is important to comply with the GDPR in order to protect the privacy interests of those involved. Another reason has been added since 2016: the Authority for Personal Data may impose a fine for breaches of the GDPR (with a maximum of € 820,000)."
tilburg-university.md,### Storage of personal data
tilburg-university.md,"Verifiability is an aspect of ethical research. On this basis, it is justifiable to store the personal data file for a minimum of ten years if this is necessary for verifiability (as stated in article 5 of the Research Data Management Regulation). However, a distinction must be made between direct and indirect identifying data."
tilburg-university.md,"Main rules from the Code of Conduct on personal data (see Section 3.10, page 14 and the explanation on page 29)"
tilburg-university.md,"1. Communication file: all communication data (except sex, place of residence, and year of birth, Section 3.8, page 14) should be deleted as soon as it is no longer necessary for the purpose of the research to have them and data are no longer necessary for contacting the person concerned. If the communication data are kept longer than six months after being obtained from data subjects, the processing of personal data must be reported to the Data Protection Officer. This notification can be made immediately upon the first notification by stating in the “Application Form Research Ethics, Data Management, Data Processing Register” that the communication data will be stored for longer than six months."
tilburg-university.md,"2. Files containing directly or indirectly identifying personal data, in which no distinction is made between communication and research files, may be kept for as long as it is reasonably foreseeable that it will be necessary for the research. Files containing anonymous data may be kept as long as it is certain (by means of new analysis techniques) that these data do not allow individuals to be traced."
tilburg-university.md,### Data leaks: report
tilburg-university.md,"On January 1, 2016, the Data Breaches (Reporting Obligation) Act came into force. This duty to report means that organizations that process personal data must immediately report to the Authority for Personal Data as soon as there is a data leak."
tilburg-university.md,More information on data leaks and how to report a data breach or security problem:
tilburg-university.md,### Rules and agreements in the event that research data personal data are shared with third parties
tilburg-university.md,"If you share research data that includes personal data, for which Tilburg University is responsible, with a third party (e.g., a hospital, a researcher who is not employed by Tilburg University, or the data is stored by a third party), further conditions apply. When you engage a third party to process data for your research (for example in the case of the storage of research data with personal data by a third party), the third party is often seen as a so-called processor. In such situations, it is a legal obligation to conclude a processor agreement between Tilburg University, as the party responsible for the data processing, and the processor. In this agreement, the parties lay down, for example, the purposes for which the data may be processed by the processor and the security measures to be taken by the processor. The processor agreement, like collaboration or research agreements, must be signed by the School Board. Legal Affairs has a model is available."
tilburg-university.md,"In other situations in which research data with personal data are shared with third parties, this is only allowed on the condition that further processing of the personal data by this third party is not incompatible with the purpose for which the data were originally collected by you."
tilburg-university.md,"If students are involved in the research who will also process personal data, the students will have to sign a confidentiality agreement. Care must also be taken to ensure that the personal data processed by the students are protected against loss or unlawful processing."

tilburg-university.md,## 7. Research Data Office
tilburg-university.md,"The Executive Board has appointed LIS for carrying out its responsibilities set out in the Research Data Management Regulation. In order to support the implementation of the Research Data Management Regulations, LIS has set up a Research Data Office (RDO). This Research Data Office functions as a central hub in which various divisions of Tilburg University bundle their support services regarding research data. Coordination of the RDO is the responsibility of LIS, which, depending on the subject, calls in specialist assistance from Legal Affairs, IT Services, Academic Services, and other parties involved."

ucl.md,4. Policy Implementation and Review Procedures .
ucl.md,### 1. Policy Background
ucl.md,"Researchers and students at UCL create data as part of the research workflow.  These data represent the evidence that underpins academic endeavours and form one half of the scholarly record, the other half represented by publication output."
ucl.md,"Data are facts, observations or experiences on which an argument or theory is constructed or tested.  Data may be numerical, descriptive, aural or visual.  Data may be raw, abstracted or analysed, experimental or observational.  Data include but are not limited to: laboratory notebooks; field notebooks; primary research data (including research data in hardcopy or in computer readable form); questionnaires; audiotapes; videotapes; models; photographs; films; test responses.  Research collections may include slides; artefacts; specimens; samples."
ucl.md,"Advances in technology have enabled the exponential growth in the creation of data, which in turn has led to both novel abilities in conducting research (data-driven science) and a new, significant data management burden."
ucl.md,"UCL recognises that appropriate management of research data leads to an enhanced research practice respecting specialist knowledge, supporting synthesis of new knowledge and facilitating collective and collaborative working practices in order to gain wisdom1.  UCL considers the research data generated by its members as a valuable research output, an asset to the institution and a critical contribution to the knowledge economy2"
ucl.md,"The purpose of this Policy is to provide a framework to define the responsibilities of all UCL members and to guide researchers and students in how to manage the data, enabling research data to be maintained and preserved as a first class research object and made available to widest possible audience for the highest possible impact."
ucl.md,This policy is intended to ensure that research data created as part of the research process are:
ucl.md,"Accurate, complete, authentic and reliable;"

ulster-university.md,### Research Data Management Policy
ulster-university.md,(currently undergoing equality screen)
ulster-university.md,## ULSTER UNIVERSITY
ulster-university.md,### Research Data Management Policy
ulster-university.md,"Ulster University recognises that research data created, collected, generated or otherwise produced during the research process are a key asset that will continue to have value for the creator, institution, and research community as a whole.  As an institution, Ulster University supports the principle of open access to publicly funded research outputs.  Research data generated at the University is recognised as an institutional asset that when shared openly not only increases the visibility of Ulster University’s research but also facilitates public engagement and creates new opportunities for knowledge exchange and collaboration."
ulster-university.md,#### 1. Preamble
ulster-university.md,"1.1 The University operates in an increasingly complex, data-oriented, environment which requires effective collection and management of, and open access  to, research data:"
ulster-university.md,to comply with the requirements of funding bodies
ulster-university.md,to underpin research excellence and academic integrity
ulster-university.md,to increase impact
ulster-university.md,to validate research results
ulster-university.md,to enable re-use in the interests of follow-up studies and the creation of new knowledge.
ulster-university.md,"1.2 To this end, the University has developed a Research Data Management (RDM) Policy which aims to:"
ulster-university.md,ensure that those involved in the research process are aware of their data-related responsibilities
ulster-university.md,ensure that the University meets its obligations with regard to research data management as defined by research funders
ulster-university.md,"promote open access to research data produced at Ulster University in order to facilitate data discovery, citation, sharing and collaboration."
ulster-university.md,1.3 A robust RDM Policy will demonstrate and ensure:
ulster-university.md,good research practice and procedures
ulster-university.md,protection of intellectual property rights (IPR)
ulster-university.md,"appropriate recording, storage, security and maintenance of access to research data"
ulster-university.md,compliance with relevant legislation and regulations.
ulster-university.md,1.4 This policy:
ulster-university.md,adheres to the UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) Common Principles on Data Policy as well as to the specific requirements of the EPSRC Policy Framework on Research Data
ulster-university.md,"provides a corporate framework with defined roles and responsibilities for the collection, quality, storage, security, maintenance and dissemination of research data"
ulster-university.md,"should be read in conjunction with all related policies, regulations and guidance documents (see Annex 1)"
ulster-university.md,#### 2 Scope
ulster-university.md,"2.1 This policy applies to all members of the University conducting research or involved in the creation, collection or generation of research data.  This shall include, but not be limited to, employed staff, research students, honorary staff, and visiting academics.  This group will be collectively referred to as ‘Researchers’."
ulster-university.md,"2.2 The University’s data management policy applies to research data in all its forms irrespective of whether or not the research is funded.  This may include raw data captured from instruments, derived data, documents, spreadsheets & databases, lab notebooks, visualisations, models, software, images, measurements and numbers."
ulster-university.md,2.3  This policy applies to all approved research projects conducted at the University by Researchers regardless of whether they are externally funded or not.
ulster-university.md,2.4  This policy will be augmented in due course with detailed procedures and guidelines for staff in relation to the management of their research data.
ulster-university.md,#### 3 Policy Requirements
ulster-university.md,"3.1 Research data must be created, maintained and shared in accordance with contractual, legislative, regulatory, ethical and other relevant requirements at the local, national and international level. Externally-funded researchers must ensure compliance with their funder’s policy on research data management and data publication.  In cases were researchers may be affected by a number of policies, funder policy should take precedence."
ulster-university.md,"3.2 All new research proposals [from date of adoption] must include research data management plans or protocols that explicitly address data capture, management, integrity, confidentiality, retention, sharing and publication."
ulster-university.md,"3.3 The storage, management and sharing of research data carries a cost, particularly if there is a need for long-term curation and dissemination, requiring the provision of staff and system resources.  Costs for data management and sharing activities should be written into research grant applications, unless explicitly forbidden by the funder."
ulster-university.md,3.4 Responsibility for research data management through a robust research data management plan during any research project or programme lies primarily with Principal Investigators (PIs) although all researchers have a personal responsibility to manage effectively the data they create.
ulster-university.md,"3.5 Where a project involves external collaborators, the lead organisation is responsible for putting appropriate formal agreements in place covering the contributions and rights of the various organisations and individuals involved.  All such agreements should be reviewed and approved by the University before the project begins.  In cases where the project is led by an external partner there is still a requirement for data generated or shared by Ulster University to be managed by a named individual with the University, usually the Lead Researcher at Ulster."
ulster-university.md,"3.6 Research Data must be held in a managed storage environment throughout the period of retention.  Data must be retained in an appropriate format and storage facility, normally for a period of at least 10 years from the date of any publication which it is based upon.  Where specific regulations with regard to data retention apply, eg: from funders, these regulations should prevail, particularly where the required retention period is longer than the University requires."
ulster-university.md,"3.7 The University will provide an infrastructure and support service for the storage, backup, registration, deposit and retention of research data in support of current and future access and, where appropriate, guidelines and templates for the research data management process and plans.  Appropriate safeguards will be put in place to ensure the legitimate interests of subjects of research data are protected."
ulster-university.md,3.8 Any research data which is retained or hosted outside the University (eg: in an external repository which is subject/journal or publisher specific) must be registered with the University.
ulster-university.md,"3.9 Research data selected for archiving must be made openly available, where appropriate, with as few restrictions as possible.  Data sharing represents a key component of good research practice that contributes to the University’s strategic objective of increasing the visibility of Ulster’s research.  The University encourages researchers that have created or captured data to make it available for access and use in a timely manner, in conditions where it is feasible under contractual, legislative, regulatory, ethical or other obligations.  Where necessary, appropriate safeguards should be put in place to protect participants and ensure that access conditions are met (e.g. Anonymisation, access passwords, inclusion of rights statement) in compliance with Ulster University’s guidance on good research practice."
ulster-university.md,"3.10 Research data produced and/or used during research must in cited in research outputs.  Good research practice is built upon the recognition of all source material that contributes to the performance of research activities.  Researchers must ensure that research data used during the research process is cited in conference papers, journal articles and other research outputs. Journal publications that report on publically funded research should include an access statement that indicates how research data may be accessed and any associated conditions."
ulster-university.md,"A persistent identifier, such as a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) should be included when one is available"
ulster-university.md,"3.11 Research data deemed to be of future historical interest, including data that substantiate research findings, will be offered and assessed for deposit and retention in an appropriate external data service or a University repository."
ulster-university.md,"3.12 Exclusive rights to host, reuse or publish research data should not be handed over to commercial publishers or agents without retaining the rights to make the data openly available for re-use, unless this is a condition of funding."
ulster-university.md,#### 4 Responsibilities
ulster-university.md,4.1 The Pro Vice-Chancellor (Research & Impact) is responsible for overseeing and ensuring the implementation of this policy.
ulster-university.md,"4.2 The University is responsible, through the Department for Research & Impact, for providing an appropriate infrastructure for the long-term storage of data including, training, guidance and support for those responsible for the creation of research data."
ulster-university.md,4.3 Associate Deans (Research & Impact)/Research Directors are responsible for ensuring tha researchers in their areas are aware of this policy.
ulster-university.md,4.4 The practical and operational responsibility for research data throughout the lifecycle of the project is the responsibility of the Principal Investigators.

The Swedish Government, funding bodies and large publishers recommend or request that research data is made accessible as far as legislation allows. Research data becomes a natural part of the scholarly publication process."
umea-university.md,"The objective of the Government’s research bills “Collaborating for knowledge – for society’s challenges and strengthened competitiveness” (2016/17:50) and “Research, freedom, future – knowledge and innovation for Sweden” (2020/21:60), is that a transition to open access to research results, including research data, should be fully implemented by 2026. Umeå University sees the adoption of this policy as a part of a process to transition to open access to research results."
umea-university.md,"Through this policy, Umeå University accepts the recommendation of the Swedish Research Council stating that research data should be managed in accordance with the international FAIR principles for scientific data management1,2. The FAIR principles mean that research data must be managed in a way that makes it findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable. The FAIR principles do not mean that all research data should be open, but as open as possible, and it should have a detailed description using metadata legible by both humans and machines."
umea-university.md,"Due to the nature and content of this document, the following aspect have not been taken into account: work environment, sustainability, collaboration, accessibility, as well as student and international perspectives."
umea-university.md,This policy is in line with the work of the university to implement HRS4R and with the university’s vision to create a work environment that provides equal opportunities for all employees. It is considered to have positive consequences for the equal opportunity work at Umeå University and to improve the university’s research environment.
umea-university.md,"This document has been translated from Swedish into English. If the English version differs from the original, the Swedish version takes precedence."
umea-university.md,### 3. Definitions
umea-university.md,#### Research data
umea-university.md,"In this policy, research data is defined according to the definition from the Swedish Research Council3: “Research data is digital information collected in order to be analysed for scientific purposes. Examples of such research data include results from experiments and measurements, observations from field work, statistics, questionnaire responses, interviews and images. Physical objects such as scientific and archaeological collections, physical art works or biobanks are not"
umea-university.md,# UMEA UNIVERSITY
umea-university.md,"regarded per se as research data; however, digital information about such objects is to be regarded as research data”."
umea-university.md,#### Research
umea-university.md,"Research is “scientific experimental or theoretical work or scientific studies conducted through observation if the work or studies are done to acquire new knowledge; it is also development work on a scientific basis, but not such work or studies that are performed only within higher education on a first or second-cycle levels”.4"
umea-university.md,#### Official document
umea-university.md,"An official document is a document or recording that is stored by an authority and has been received by or created at an authority. A recording is considered to be stored by an authority, if it is accessible to the authority with technical aids that the authority itself uses for transmission of its content in such a form that it can be read, heard or otherwise comprehended."
umea-university.md,### 4. Starting points
umea-university.md,"Umeå University shares the view that everyone should have open access to research publications and research data that are completely or partly funded by public funds to the extent that is permitted by legislation, ethics and commercial interests. The research data that forms basis for scientific publications must be easily accessible for peer review, journals and publishers and be made accessible in accordance with the recommendations of the Swedish Research Council. All source data and materials that document the research process are property of Umeå University and must, as a general rule, be archived according to the university’s records management plan for research, when a research project has been completed."
umea-university.md,"Umeå University supports the establishment of sustainable research infrastructures and services for managing research data at a local and national level. Based on current laws such as the General Data Protection Regulation, the Freedom of the Press Act and other regulations, internal regulatory documents and requirements from the Swedish Research Council, the EU and other research funding bodies, Umeå University offers their researchers support in managing and making research results and research data accessible."
umea-university.md,"The local infrastructure for research data and research data management is to be developed continuously and must follow laws, regulations and guidelines from the Government, the EU, the Swedish Research Council and other relevant research funding bodies and actors. In this way, correct management, storage, sharing and long-term preservation of research data is ensured."
umea-university.md,"This policy applies to all employees who conduct research and includes all subjects and areas where research is performed at Umeå University. It clarifies responsibilities and provides guidance on how Umeå University should manage and preserve research data from the planning stage of a research project, during the project and after the end of the project. Intellectual property rights are not included in this context."
umea-university.md,### 5. Responsibility and rules for management of research data
umea-university.md,"The main rule is that research data must be managed correctly and securely in accordance with current legislation, ethics and good research practice."
umea-university.md,#### 5.1 Publication of research data
umea-university.md,Umeå University adopts the Swedish Research Council’s recommendations for publishing research data in the version published by the council in spring 2020.
umea-university.md,"The Swedish Research Council recommends that research data financed via public funds, and applicable legislation allows to be published, should be published openly on the internet within a reasonable time after the research results have been published."
umea-university.md,#### Legal and ethical aspects affect access
umea-university.md,"Determining which data can be published with open access shall always be based on applicable legislation. Some research data must not be published with open access due to legal or ethical aspects (if they are covered by secrecy legislation, include personal data or IP material, for example), but the options for publishing data may also be affected by other factors, such as the volume of the data sets."
umea-university.md,"If open access to research data cannot be provided, the reason why this is not possible should be documented."
umea-university.md,"Data created in the research process and forming the basis for publications This recommendation covers data created during the research process and forming the basis for scientific publications. If already existing data from other actors have been used, such as various types of public agency data, then these data only constitute research data if they have been analysed, processed or otherwise refined during the research process. Already existing data that have only been used in their original form and that are already managed and made accessible by another actor are not covered by this recommendation."
umea-university.md,#### Metadata should also be published with open access
umea-university.md,"Both research data and data describing research data (known as metadata) should be published with open access. If there are obstacles to publishing research data, the focus should in the first instance be on making metadata openly accessible on the internet. In this way, users can find information on what research data exists, even when there are obstacles to open publication, for example lack of a suitable publication platform or technical limitations that prevent all data from being published."
umea-university.md,#### Publication according to the FAIR principles
umea-university.md,"Publication of research data can be done using various digital platforms, for example via the higher education institution where the research is conducted or via other relevant national and/or international portals, infrastructures and similar organisations and platforms. The publication of research data shall always be based on the FAIR principles."
umea-university.md,#### 5.2 Data management plans
umea-university.md,Umeå University recommends its researchers to write a data management plan5 at the beginning of each research project and to keep it updated continuously throughout the project. A data
umea-university.md,"management plan should, for instance, specify how research data is to be collected, stored, managed, documented, used and made accessible during and after the research project. Umeå University has a template for data management plans, which, together with help texts, is also available in an online tool. In some cases, it is mandatory for researchers to establish a data management plan, for instance for certain research projects funded by the EU and by the Swedish Research Council. A data management plan should also be set up for all new doctoral student projects, together with the corresponding research plan."
umea-university.md,#### 5.3 Ownership and collaborations
umea-university.md,"Research data generated in research at Umeå University is an official document of the authority in accordance with the Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act and the archive legislation, and are owned by Umeå University. In research projects that are conducted in collaboration with external parties such as other Swedish authorities, Region Västerbotten, companies and universities abroad, the terms of ownership of research data must be regulated in collaboration agreements that should be reviewed by a university legal officer. The starting point for such agreements is that Umeå University reserves the rights to use, publish, share or make publicly accessible research data that is produced or stored at Umeå University, and that the recommendations of the Swedish Research Council for publishing research data are followed. The terms must not restrict the obligations of the university under the Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act and the archive legislation."
umea-university.md,#### 5.4 Storage and giving access to research data
umea-university.md,Research data must be managed and stored at Umeå University in accordance with the routines that Umeå University recommends for storage and information security. Umeå University is responsible for ensuring that all research data can be stored on suitable and secure storage spaces and for providing sustainable infrastructure to make research data accessible in accordance with the recommendations of the Swedish Research Council (see 5.1).
umea-university.md,#### 5.5 Description of research data
umea-university.md,"Research data should be provided with standardized and machine-readable metadata in accordance with the FAIR principles in order to make the data searchable, comprehensible and reusable by others than the researcher who created it. Even in cases where research data cannot be made openly accessible, it is recommended that the researcher describes the research project using metadata to make it visible and searchable. Metadata can be published in the metadata catalogue provided by the consortium of the Swedish National Data Service (SND), in which Umeå University is included."
umea-university.md,#### 5.6 Research data with copyright protected material
umea-university.md,"Research data that contains material belonging to others and that is protected by copyright cannot be made publicly accessible but the copyright does not prevent such data from being archived and described through metadata, which in turn should be made openly accessible."
umea-university.md,#### 5.7 Supervision of doctoral students and students
umea-university.md,"Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that doctoral students and students receive clear instructions for managing research data safely and correctly. In a doctoral project, doctoral students and their supervisors are together responsible for ensuring that there is a data management plan describing the routines for managing research data during and after the doctoral project. The research data management should follow this policy. Doctoral students and their supervisors are also together responsible for ensuring that research data generated in the doctoral project, which is funded by Umeå University or by a third party, is managed according to the routines of the department when doctoral students complete their doctoral studies."
umea-university.md,#### 5.8 Support by teaching and guidance
umea-university.md,Umeå University is to offer support for the correct management of research data in the form of education and information as well as by expert advice. Instructions regarding correct management of research data should also be included in the training of doctoral students at an early stage.
umea-university.md,#### 5.9 Access to research data when changing jobs
umea-university.md,"If employees change jobs and want to take a copy of the research data from the projects they have worked on at Umeå University with them, they should discuss with their head of department if and how this can be made possible. The details are to be regulated by a written agreement between the higher education institutions involved and specific terms and conditions regarding secrecy and personal data are to be noted."
umea-university.md,#### 5.10 Archiving and disposal of research data
umea-university.md,"Research data is an official document and part of the Swedish cultural heritage and must be archived indefinitely unless a decision is made to dispose of the data. Archiving of research data is to be carried out, regardless of whether research data is made accessible or not, in accordance with the current records management plan. The head of department is responsible for making decisions regarding the disposal of research data. The metadata description of research data should always be preserved, which also includes metadata that describes research data that has been disposed of."
universite-libre-de-bruxelles.md,# ULB Institutional policy on Research Data Management
universite-libre-de-bruxelles.md,## Introduction
universite-libre-de-bruxelles.md,"At its Academic Council meeting of 26 April 2021, ULB adopted the following policy1 on the management of Research Data, generated and processed by Researchers as part of their research activities at ULB."
universite-libre-de-bruxelles.md,"This policy aims to develop and promote a solid and secure management of Research Data to increase the efficiency, the quality, the integrity and the transparency of scientific research, as well as to facilitate the development of new knowledge, and to ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations, ethical and contractual obligations, and provisions of external research funding agencies. Ideally, Research Data management should be considered and integrated throughout the life cycle of the research data."
universite-libre-de-bruxelles.md,"Furthermore, various research funders such as the FNRS or the European Commission are increasingly requesting that a Data Management Plan accompanies any funded project. This is thus an evolution that urgently needed to be acknowledged in our institution."
universite-libre-de-bruxelles.md,This document represents an aspirational policy; its implementation will likely take several years and require communication and support efforts towards the scientific community
universite-libre-de-bruxelles.md,Practical Guidelines are available on the ULB personnel portal:
universite-libre-de-bruxelles.md,## Definitions
universite-libre-de-bruxelles.md,"Anonymisation: Process by which personal data is irreversibly altered in such a way that a data subject can no longer be identified directly or indirectly, either by the data controller alone or in collaboration with any other party."

Of note, medical data related to patients must be kept for 30 years (link)."
universite-libre-de-bruxelles.md,"Data retention primarily concerns all Research Data and accompanying documentation which are reasonably required or appropriate to verify (and reproduce) the scientific claims communicated by the Researcher. The degree of processing of the Research Data which are to be retained will partly depend on the type of research, the kind of Research Data, and/or possible practical considerations. It can also be relevant to retain Research Data with potential value for reuse."
universite-libre-de-bruxelles.md,"5.2. Research Data and accompanying documentation which were selected for retention should be deposited in a reliable Archive or Data Repository in accordance with the institutional Guidelines to ensure secure, long-term retention and accessibility (with appropriate access rights)."
universite-libre-de-bruxelles.md,"At minimum, if Research Data is deposited in an external Archive, Researchers should supply the metadata for these Research Data in DI-fusion, the ULB institutional repository, with a link to the data in the external Archive. (See institutional Guidelines for depositing and providing access to research data available on the ULB website.)"
universite-libre-de-bruxelles.md,"Researchers who are supervised (e.g. master students, doctoral students, unpaid and/or voluntary researchers) need to make prior arrangements with their research mentor, supervisor, or coordinator on where these research data will be retained, for whom they will be accessible, and how they are allowed to be used in the future."
university-campus-suffolk.md,# DATA MANAGEMENT POLICY
university-campus-suffolk.md,## Purpose
university-campus-suffolk.md,1. This document explains the University of Suffolk’s policy on data protection and data management and is based on the following principles:
university-campus-suffolk.md,"The University will comply with all relevant legislation, particularly the Data Protection Act 2018 and the EU General Data Protection Regulations 2016 (“GDPR”). Ensuring compliance is a corporate responsibility of the University requiring the active involvement of, and appreciation by, all Employees and Other Workers1 at all levels of the organisation, including honorary staff/associates, contractors, hourly paid lecturers and any students or interns carrying out work on behalf of the University. The University will provide support and services to enable staff handling personal data to remain compliant with the legislation and the University’s requirements in respect of data security."
university-campus-suffolk.md,## About the Policy
university-campus-suffolk.md,"2. At the University, personal data from a wide range of individuals is collected, analysed, stored, shared, transferred, processed and at the end of the retention period, destroyed. Personal data used in this way, is from staff, students, applicants, alumni, visitors and people taking part in our research. Maintaining the security and privacy of this personal data is essential. This policy sets out the University’s requirements as Data Controller when processing this Personal Data."
university-campus-suffolk.md,3. This Policy is approved by the University’s Quality Committee and is subject to review every four years in line with the University’s review schedule of policies and procedures. Review will take place earlier where changes in legislation require such review.

university-campus-suffolk.md,### Training
university-campus-suffolk.md,"10. All staff must complete the University’s online Data Protection training, which is available via the University of Suffolk Online Training portal. Most staff are required to complete the module every three years. Some staff are required to complete it annually because of the nature of their work (e.g. if they work with NHS patient data). New members of staff must complete this module as part of their induction. It is the responsibility of managers to ensure that their staff complete the required training, including any additional training required (for example, for researchers), both as part of their induction and biennially thereafter, recording completion in the individual’s My Review record."
university-campus-suffolk.md,"11. Whilst some staff will have received elements of data protection training as part of their research requirements, researchers employed by the University must also complete the University’s online Data Protection Training (University of Suffolk Online Training) regardless of any previous training."
university-campus-suffolk.md,12. The Data Governance Team regularly reviews completion records and routinely contacts those who have not completed their training. If no action is taken from this contact the Data Governance team contacts the line manager of the individual
university-campus-suffolk.md,"13. It is the responsibility of the Pro Vice-Chancellor of Research and for each supervisor of Postgraduate Research Students to ensure the University’s online Data Protection Training is undertaken by PGR students (or any additional data protection training modules identified as appropriate), at the outset of their programme or annually, and for ensuring completion. More generally the module can be made available to those students undertaking research which involves the use of personal data, as required."
university-campus-suffolk.md,## Data Protection Principles

university-campus-suffolk.md,"18. As an organisation that processes personal and special category data, the University is required to register with the ICO. Since 2006 the University has featured on the ICO’s Register of data protection fee payers with registration number Z9376827 as a public authority data controller."
university-campus-suffolk.md,### Data Protection Officer
university-campus-suffolk.md,"19. The University’s Data Protection Officer, supported by the Data Governance Team, advises the University on data protection law, monitors compliance, provides advice to Data Users, and ensures that guidance, training, and resources are available to Data Users.  The Data Protection Officer is the point of contact for individuals wishing to exercise their rights in relation to their data, and for any contact with the ICO.  Contact details for the Data Protection Officer and their team who deal with general queries and Subject Access Requests are as follows:"
university-campus-suffolk.md,Data Protection Officer datagovernance@uos.ac.uk 01473 338240
university-campus-suffolk.md,### Legal basis for processing
university-campus-suffolk.md,"20. Whenever the University processes personal data there must be a valid lawful basis for that processing. There are six lawful bases for general processing of Personal Data and ten lawful bases for processing Special Category Data. If Special Category Data is being processed, both a lawful basis for general processing and an additional condition for processing this type of data must be identified. These are listed in full in Appendix 3."
university-campus-suffolk.md,21. Further sources of advice and guidance are set out in Appendix 4.
university-campus-suffolk.md,"22. In practice, for many of the University’s activities it will rely on the legal basis that the ‘processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest’ as this covers our work as a university in teaching and research. However sometimes the University will need to rely on alternative bases, and these will be documented in the Data Privacy Impact Assessment carried out in respect of the specific activity."
university-campus-suffolk.md,### Profiling and Automated Decision Making
university-campus-suffolk.md,23. The ICO has produced guidance (Automated decision-making and profiling) on Profiling and Automated Decision Making which is available on its website and should be taken into account before considering any activity or task which involves Profiling or Automated Decision Making.
university-campus-suffolk.md,"24. Before starting a task or activity which involves Profiling or Automated Decision Making, the following steps must be carried out:"
university-campus-suffolk.md,a. A Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) must be carried out. The Data Governance Team must be informed and consulted as part of that exercise
university-campus-suffolk.md,b. A Privacy Notice must inform individuals if their data will be used for solely automated decision-making processes with legal or similarly significant effects. This must explicitly set out the Data Subject’s rights. The Privacy Notice should be approved and held by the Data Governance Team.
university-campus-suffolk.md,"c. The DPIA must be kept under regular review, and records of those reviews must be retained."
university-campus-suffolk.md,### Data Protection by Design and Data Privacy Impact Assessments (DPIAs)
university-campus-suffolk.md,"25. An aspect of the accountability and governance data protection principle, the University must ensure that consideration is given to the protection of data from design through the life cycle of the process or system."
university-campus-suffolk.md,"26. It is therefore the responsibility of any University member introducing or designing a new process or system, to take account of the data protection principles and ensure that data protection laws are complied with and can be demonstrated. Information pertaining to the University DPIA process can be found by staff on The Hub."
university-campus-suffolk.md,27. A DPIA enables Data Users to identify and minimise the data protection risks of a project. A DPIA must be completed for any data processing that is likely to result in a high risk to individuals. It is also good practice to complete a DPIA for major projects which will require the processing of personal data.
university-campus-suffolk.md,28. A DPIA should:
university-campus-suffolk.md,"Provide a description of the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing"
university-campus-suffolk.md,"Assess necessity, proportionality and compliance measures"
university-campus-suffolk.md,Identify and assess risks to individuals
university-campus-suffolk.md,Identify additional measures required to mitigate the risks
university-campus-suffolk.md,29. Further information about DPIAs is available on the ICO website (ICO - Data Protection Impact Assessments).
university-campus-suffolk.md,30. DPIAs should be shared with the Data Protection Officer (datagovernance@uos.ac.uk) prior to sign-off and commencement of the project.
university-campus-suffolk.md,### Data Retention
university-campus-suffolk.md,"31. Data at the University of Suffolk are retained and disposed of according to need. The overarching principle is that data should only be retained and stored for as long as such data have a legitimate purpose, and thereafter they should be disposed of securely. Each School and Professional Service area of the Institution holds a Data Retention Schedule which specifies the nature of the data retained, the retention period, the reason for retention, and the action to be taken at the end of the retention period, including how the data are to be disposed of."
university-campus-suffolk.md,"32. At the end of the retention period, data should be disposed of and/or destroyed. Manual confidential waste must be placed in the lockable confidential waste bins located across campus (please see list of locations under Estates and Sustainability on Hub) and not in general paper recycling bins."

university-college-dublin.md,Policy owner UCD Research & Innovation
university-college-dublin.md,"Approval date and body GA, 25th June 2020"
university-college-dublin.md,## 1. Purpose
university-college-dublin.md,University College Dublin recognises that the management of research data is fundamental to both high quality research and academic integrity. Accurate and retrievable research data is an essential component of any research project and is necessary to verify and defend the process and outcomes of research.
university-college-dublin.md,"Research data is valuable to researchers for the duration of their research, and may well have longterm value for research, teaching and for wider exploitation for the public good by individuals, government, business and other organisations."
university-college-dublin.md,"The objective of the Research Data Management (RDM) Policy is to provide a framework for the management of research data to ensure that research data is stored, retained, made available for use and reuse, and disposed of according to best international practices for data management, as well as in compliance with legal, statutory, ethical, contractual and intellectual property obligations, and the requirements of funding bodies and publishers."
university-college-dublin.md,## 2. Definitions
university-college-dublin.md,### UCD Community means
university-college-dublin.md,"all UCD employees, whether part time or full time, permanent or temporary;"
university-college-dublin.md,all employees of UCD’s wholly owned subsidiary companies or overseas campus/offices; all registered students of UCD;
university-college-dublin.md,"non-University employees who use University funds, facilities or other resources, including the University’s name and reputation, to carry out teaching and/or research, and/or participate in UCD-administered research, including retired employees, visiting faculty and researchers; consultants, contractors, affiliated hospital staff, industrial personnel and research fellows, regardless of obligations to other companies or institutions; and"
university-college-dublin.md,"all persons conducting teaching and/or research at or under the auspices of UCD including at any of UCD’s overseas campus, including visiting faculty and researchers; consultants; contractors, Emeritus or adjunct appointments; and research fellows."
university-college-dublin.md,Researchers are defined as members of the UCD Community carrying out research.
university-college-dublin.md,"Research data is information collected to be examined and considered, and to serve as a basis for reasoning, discussion or calculation. It is used as a primary source to support technical or scientific enquiry, research, scholarship, or artistic activity, is used as evidence in the research process, and/or is commonly accepted in the research community as necessary to validate research findings and results. Examples of research data are experimental data, observational data, operational data, third party data, public sector data, monitoring data, or repurposed data.  The focus in this policy is on research data that is available in either electronic or paper form."
university-college-dublin.md,Research data lifecycle is the sequence of stages that a particular unit of data goes through from its initial generation or capture to its eventual archival and/or deletion at the end of its planned life.
university-college-dublin.md,A secure environment is a system or facility which implements the controlled storage and use of research data.
university-college-dublin.md,"A data management plan or DMP is a formal document that outlines how data is to be handled both during a research project and after the project is completed. Data management plans must assure that research data is traceable, available, authentic, citable, properly stored and that it adheres to clearly defined legal parameters and appropriate safety measures governing subsequent use."
university-college-dublin.md,## 3. Scope
university-college-dublin.md,The scope of the policy covers research data created or managed by Researchers.
university-college-dublin.md,## 4. Principles
university-college-dublin.md,"(1) The University promotes best practice for research data management through clear policy, guidance, supervision, training and support."
university-college-dublin.md,"(2) Researchers, service providers and, where appropriate, research sponsors and external collaborators should work in partnership to implement good practice."
university-college-dublin.md,(3) Research data will be managed by Researchers to the highest standards throughout the research data lifecycle as part of the University’s commitment to research excellence.
university-college-dublin.md,"(4) Research data should be compliant to the principles of FAIR data (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Re-Useable): Findable: Identifiable, retrievable, and available when needed; Accessible: Able to be made available to others in line with appropriate legal, statutory (including data protection regulations), ethical, contractual, intellectual property, data sharing and open access principles in a suitable repository or archiving system with persistent identifiers. Interoperable: Should be accurate, complete, authentic and reliable, and where possible made available in non-proprietary formats that facilitate data exchange and re-use; Re-Useable: Assigned a licence for open use where possible in compliance with intellectual property rights, and if no third-party rights, data protection, legal requirements or property laws prohibit it."
university-college-dublin.md,"(5) Research data should be kept in a manner that is compliant with legal and ethical obligations and, where applicable, the requirements of funding bodies, publishers and protocols set out in the National Policy Statement on Ensuring Research Integrity in Ireland."
university-college-dublin.md,"(6) Research data should be retained in a secure environment for as long as it is of continuing value to the researcher and the wider research community, and as long as specified by research funder, publisher, patent law, legislative and other regulatory requirements. The normal minimum retention period for research data is ten years after publication or public release of the work of the research. (Longer periods apply in certain cases, such as in relation to historical data.) If data includes personal or sensitive information, informants must be informed of the data retention policy at the time data is collected, in compliance with data protection regulations."
university-college-dublin.md,"(7) If research data is to be deleted or destroyed, either because the agreed period of retention has expired or for legal or ethical reasons, this should be done so in accordance with all legal, ethical, research funder and collaborator requirements and with particular concern for confidentiality and security."
university-college-dublin.md,"(8) If a personal data breach occurs, it is to be dealt with in accordance with UCD data protection policies."
university-college-dublin.md,"(9) Increasingly, research projects are funded by external parties and/or involve collaboration with third parties such as other research performing organisations, charities, industry, etc.  In such cases, contractual requirements such as the funder’s terms and conditions, grant agreement(s), collaboration agreement(s), industry contract(s) etc. may apply to the project. These contractual requirements constitute legally binding obligations on the University and the Researchers involved in the project, and often include specific provisions regarding ownership, management, retention and access to data, confidentiality obligations, IT security, publication requirements etc.  Contractual obligations apply in addition to the principles and requirements contained in this policy.  If there is a conflict between this policy and a contractual obligation, the contractual obligation will override the requirements of this policy and it is the researcher’s responsibility to ensure compliance."
university-college-dublin.md,## 5. Roles and responsibilities
university-college-dublin.md,Researchers are responsible for:
university-college-dublin.md,Managing research data in accordance with the principles above;
university-college-dublin.md,"Developing and documenting clear procedures for the collection, storage, use, re-use, access and retention or destruction of the research data and records associated with their research. This shall include, where appropriate, defining protocols and responsibilities in a joint or multiinstitution collaborative research project. This information should be incorporated, where appropriate, in a research data management plan. For research that includes personal data, the researcher needs to identify what contracts or agreements with collaborators or contractors are required to satisfy data protection obligations;"
university-college-dublin.md,"Planning for the ongoing custodianship (at the University or using third-party services) of their data after the completion of the research or, in the event of their departure or retirement from the University, reaching agreement with the Head of School/Institute Director (or their nominee) as to where such data will be located and how this will be stored. Where personal data is part of the research data, it has to be assured that any agreement made is in line with the communication provided to and reasonable expectations of research participants;"
university-college-dublin.md,"Ensuring that any requirements in relation to research data management placed on their research by publishers, funding bodies or regulatory agencies or under the terms of a research contract with the University are also met."
university-college-dublin.md,"The University provides resources to facilitate Researchers in meeting their responsibilities, in the form of supporting services and expert advice as well as technical infrastructures. Information on available supports is available at the online UCD Research Portal. The University is committed to, and will maintain oversight of, good practice in research data management. To this end, it reserves the right to verify that all research data has been kept in a manner that is compliant with this policy and, where applicable, the requirements of funding bodies and publishers."
university-college-dublin.md,## 6. Personal data and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
university-college-dublin.md,"The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into force on 25 May 2018.  It is intended to strengthen data protection for individuals across the EU, and imposes increased obligations on organisations that process personal data.  Processing is very broadly defined as the collection, storage, recording, disclosure of, structuring, making available and erasure or destruction.  The GDPR applies to the processing of personal data by controllers and processors in the EU, regardless of whether or not the processing takes place in the EU, and furthermore it restricts the transfer of personal data to locations outside the EU unless certain conditions or safeguards are in place. At the core of the GDPR are seven principles which must be observed by all data controllers and processors. These are transparency, purpose limitation, data minimisation, accuracy, storage limitation, integrity and confidentiality and accountability."
university-college-dublin.md,"The definition of personal data is broad under the GDPR and encompasses “any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person”.  The GDPR specifically includes “location data”, “online identifiers” such as IP addresses and “genetic” data as examples of personal data. Certain categories of personal data attract a greater level of protection under the GDPR. These include: personal data relating to racial/ethnic origin, political opinions, religious/philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, health and biometric data, and data concerning sex life or sexual orientation.  However, the GDPR does not apply to fully anonymised or aggregated data where a living individual cannot under any circumstances ever be identified or singled out."
university-college-dublin.md,"If your research data includes personal data as defined under the GDPR it is very important that the following are consulted: Article 9 of GDPR, UCD GDPR website and the Health Research Board’s GDPR guidance for researchers."

university-medical-center-utrecht.md,### 1.1. Topic
university-medical-center-utrecht.md,Policy on the management of research data.
university-medical-center-utrecht.md,### 1.2. Description
university-medical-center-utrecht.md,"An important ambition of UMC Utrecht is 'Open Science ' for better health care and social involvement.  This is about 'open access' (free access to scientific publications), 'open data' and reuse of scientific data, making science more efficient, more widely applicable and reproducible. Data is the foundation of scientific research. Throughout the research cycle, the quality and durability of data must therefore be ensured through careful management. If the quality and durability of data is not in order, the research is not reproducible. Making the data ‘open’ and reusable is not considered.  Research Data Management (RDM) deals with the collection, documentation, processing, storage, sustainable archiving and reusability of the research data. Funders and publishers also take part in above ambition and ask for a data management plan, wherein the researcher demonstrates that the data to be collected, will be available for reuse in the future."
university-medical-center-utrecht.md,The policy is based on the following documents:
university-medical-center-utrecht.md,The Research Code of UMC Utrecht
university-medical-center-utrecht.md,Privacy Regulations of UMC Utrecht

university-medical-center-utrecht.md,"For all scientific output we strive for the highest possible degree of 'Fairness', where FAIR stands for:"
university-medical-center-utrecht.md,"Findable: datasets are findable, provided with a persistent identifier1 and sufficient metadata2, with which specific datasets can be found;"
university-medical-center-utrecht.md,"Accessible: datasets are accessible, either at data level or at metadata level, and clear user conditions have been drawn up;"
university-medical-center-utrecht.md,Interoperable: datasets are interchangeable and standard terminologies and vocabularies are used wherever possible;
university-medical-center-utrecht.md,"Reusable: datasets are reusable, meet the above criteria and are sufficiently described, so that reuse is scientifically and ethically sound."
university-medical-center-utrecht.md,### 2. Privacy by Default/ Privacy by Design
university-medical-center-utrecht.md,The use of personal data for research is based on:
university-medical-center-utrecht.md,"A. Privacy by Default : the chosen standard method maximally guarantees the privacy of the data subject3 (such as use of standard research folder design). The Privacy by Default idea is built into the technology of, for example, data collection and other work processes."
university-medical-center-utrecht.md,B. Privacy by Design: consider privacy when designing the study (such as minimizing the amount of personal data and pseudonymising as soon as possible).
university-medical-center-utrecht.md,### 3. Dataminimization
university-medical-center-utrecht.md,"Not only in the context of privacy laws, but also in the context of efficiency and scientific integrity, the collection of research data (and in particular of personal data) needs to be demonstrably legitimate, fit for the purpose of the study, and contain no irrelevant data. However, some research requires a broader collection of data (for example to find accidental discoveries in a certain clinical picture in cohort studies). This is described in the Data Management Plan."
university-medical-center-utrecht.md,### 4. Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)
university-medical-center-utrecht.md,"A DPIA4 ensures that the impact of the intended project on the privacy of those involved and the risks for those involved and for the organization is considered before the start of the project. For processing of health information that is directly or indirectly traceable to the person (sensitive personal data), we assume that the outcome of a DPIA will be 'high risk' . Therefore, for each study it is described which measures will be taken to minimize the impact on the privacy of the study participants. This is described in the Data Management Plan."
university-medical-center-utrecht.md,### 5. Research Data in control
university-medical-center-utrecht.md,"In line with the general standards of the Netherlands Code of Conduct for Research Integrity 2018 it is ensured that data sources are verifiable, that there is an honest and transparent description of the data collection, that both raw and final data are carefully stored and that the data are as FAIR as possible.  It is also ensured that all data and research materials are collected with the appropriate infrastructure, that they are archived in a sustainable manner and are as ‘open’ as possible and as ‘closed’ (confidential) as necessary."
university-medical-center-utrecht.md,### 6. Data Sharing Statement
university-medical-center-utrecht.md,"In the context of Open Science, the sharing of scientific data with other researchers is encouraged.  A data sharing statement is a statement about which research data will be shared after completion of the research, how the data will be made available and under which conditions this will be done.  The data sharing statement provides a good description of why data can or cannot be shared and is therefore a compulsory part of the Data Management Plan for all scientific research. This requires compliance with laws and regulations in the field of privacy. This is based on the principle ""As open as possible, as closed as necessary""."
university-medical-center-utrecht.md,### 7. Researchers access to data expertise
university-medical-center-utrecht.md,"Like other Dutch UMCs, UMC Utrecht follows the NFU Guidelines for data stewardship. We view data as legitimate and citable products of research, and are transparent about how the data can be viewed or used6. The support of researchers by data management experts is organized differently per division.  In the coming year, data stewardship will be formalized, as described by NFU Data4lifesciences, to provide a more policyoriented approach to data management within the Divisions."
university-medical-center-utrecht.md,## 3. Implementation framework
university-medical-center-utrecht.md,3.1. Preparation of the research
university-medical-center-utrecht.md,### 3.1.1. Data Management Plan (DMP)
university-medical-center-utrecht.md,"In the context of integrity and transparency of research and FAIR data for Open Science, UMC Utrecht researchers are required to fill in a DMP for scientific research7 using the UMC Utrecht specific DMP template, unless a funder has a mandatory template8. The UMC Utrecht DMP template supports researchers with examples of answers, and with information about the specific subjects.  Data managers can be consulted if necessary.  With this , the UMC Utrecht aims for transparency in data management processes and compliance with legislation and regulations. The content of the DMP is in line with national and international initiatives9."
university-medical-center-utrecht.md,### 3.1.2. Storage and organization of files
university-medical-center-utrecht.md,"For research purposes, UMC Utrecht offers the Research Folder Structure. Separate storage of personal data and research data is possible here. The storage location is recorded in the Data Management Plan. The storage location is under management at UMC Utrecht unless otherwise stated in the Data Management Plan. The principal investigator is responsible for the proper management of the research folders. The organization and access to folders is carried out by an authorized employee on behalf of the principal investigator."
university-medical-center-utrecht.md,### 3.2.2. Registration of research participation
university-medical-center-utrecht.md,"In view of patient safety, it is important that every participation in scientific research is registered in the electronic patient database (EPD). This also applies to healthy volunteers. In case, for valid reasons, it is not desirable to register healthy subjects in the EPD, one can deviate from registration in the EPD ( see SOP Performing WMO-study). This must be documented in the DMP."
university-medical-center-utrecht.md,### 3.2.3. Re-use of data
university-medical-center-utrecht.md,"Re-use of healthcare data (retrospective studies) is possible after pseudonymization of the data (see also 3.3.2). Data that are collected in healthcare, are made available for research in the Research Data Platform (RDP). For specific expertise and guided searches in sources one can use the Utrecht Patient Oriented Database (UPOD). Making data available for reuse must always comply with applicable laws and regulations. For the use of external data sources for research, researchers turn to the supplier of the data and jointly draw up a Data Access Agreement. Often this is based on documents from the supplier."
university-medical-center-utrecht.md,### 3.2.4. Raw data storage
university-medical-center-utrecht.md,"Collected data, whether this has been done via re-use or via new data collection,  needs to be stored and frozen (read only) as 'raw data' immediately after collection. Raw data are not to be edited or changed. This is necessary, so that, at any time, one can trace back to the original data."
university-medical-center-utrecht.md,### 3.3. Data preparation
university-medical-center-utrecht.md,#### 3.3.1. Validation
university-medical-center-utrecht.md,"All adaptations for validation and preparation of a suitable dataset for analysis are documented in such a way that the research results are verifiable. For all scientific research it is mandatory to keep an audit trail. When the raw data consists of care data which are erroneously recorded in the electronic patient files (EPD), the usual care processes are followed to adjust that information.  This means that only the care provider can change this data, and not the researcher."
university-medical-center-utrecht.md,#### 3.3.2. Anonymize/Pseudonymize
university-medical-center-utrecht.md,"Directly identifying personal data must be stored separately from the research data, and research data must be anonymised or pseudonymised. Care data are almost always indirectly traceable to the person and completely anonymizing will therefore often not be possible.  A pseudonymised file can indirectly be traced back to a natural person, as long as a key file exists. An important reason to still pseudonymise data is that this removes the direct traceability to a person. Technical facilities (such as the RDP and the Research Folder Structure) and procedural provisions ensure that the researcher does not have access to the directly identifying data.  In case of indirect traceability to a person in research files, appropriate measures are taken to remove the indirect traceability to an individual when publishing or sharing data10."
university-medical-center-utrecht.md,#### 3.3.3. Storage of analysis file
university-medical-center-utrecht.md,"After validation and preparation, and before final analysis and reporting, the analysis file is to be frozen. The analysis file is pseudonymised, or anonymized. For separate storage of personal data and research data, the Research Folder Structure can be used.  In a frozen data collection it is no longer allowed to change or add data. Statistical analyses are only performed on the frozen datasets."
university-medical-center-utrecht.md,#### 3.3.4. Requirements for data storage
university-medical-center-utrecht.md,"For all types of research, the storage location is physically and digitally protected. The policy of UMC Utrecht regarding information security is described in the Information Security Directive. UMC Utrecht provides a number of storage locations that meet these requirements, such as bulk storage and departmental disks.  The DMP must describe where the data is stored, so that it is clear for every employee in the research team, where the data can be found."
university-medical-center-utrecht.md,#### 3.3.5. Data exchange during a study
university-medical-center-utrecht.md,"Exchanging data with internal colleagues and external partners during a study, is done in a safe manner according to the regulations of the UMC Utrecht, which can be found under this link. Prior to the exchange"
university-medical-center-utrecht.md,"and sharing of data with external parties, a Data Transfer Agreement has been drawn up, which establishes the conditions under which data are shared."
university-medical-center-utrecht.md,### 3.4. Metadata and Documentation
university-medical-center-utrecht.md,"Metadata provide the information needed to enable a broad scientific community to find, share and understand the content and context of a dataset.  When compiling metadata, standardization is sought as much as possible.  With the mandatory DMP, UMC Utrecht supports researchers in the implementation of good metadata of research data, which is a prerequisite for FAIR data."
university-medical-center-utrecht.md,### 3.5. Data Analysis
university-medical-center-utrecht.md,"The scripts for data analysis are saved and commented (thus creating an audit trail), so that, when the script is read by an experienced colleague researcher/statistician/data analyst, it is completely clear why the steps in the analysis have been taken and which choices have been made."
university-medical-center-utrecht.md,### 3.6. Data Archiving
university-medical-center-utrecht.md,#### 3.6.1. Transfer of custody after completion
university-medical-center-utrecht.md,"When a principal investigator leaves after completion of the research, the management of the research folder and all data must be transferred to the new responsible person or to the department head.  Data collected for scientific research, in which UMC Utrecht is end responsible or performs part of the research, are stored in storage locations managed by UMC Utrecht, unless other contractual agreements have been made about this."
university-medical-center-utrecht.md,"10 Suitable measures, e.g. aggregation of data (use of birth year in stead of birth date) or minimization of data in light of ‘the more variables you combine, the higher the risk of indirect identification’."
university-medical-center-utrecht.md,#### 3.6.2. Documentation and Publication
university-medical-center-utrecht.md,"To ensure that all relevant data remain accessible, detailed agreements must be made prior to the start of the study, about all relevant data and the format in which they will be made available or transferred after the study has ended (see also ICH-GCP 4.9. 0, 4.9.4 and 4.9.5.). In order to archive the research data, a data package is created, consisting of data, metadata and documentation.  Which specific metadata and documents are archived, depends on the type of research. The data package contains all information for the research to be replicated. The Data Management Plan and the Division Datamanager offer support in the selection of files in a data package."
university-medical-center-utrecht.md,#### 3.6.3. Storage period
university-medical-center-utrecht.md,"Concerning the retention period, there are different legal standards for different types of research: this is at least 15 years for research with humans (Basic Selection Document), unless otherwise contracted. Anonymous datasets receive, with applicable conditions, an infinite storage period by depositing the sets in a dedicated archive (see Data Archiving), so that the data is available for future scientific research."
university-medical-center-utrecht.md,#### 3.6.4. Data Archiving
university-medical-center-utrecht.md,"Data storage and data archiving is not the same. Data can be stored safely, but this does not mean that data will be findable and accessible in the future. Data archiving, on the other hand, is about the sustainable accessibility of the research data, where the data are provided with metadata, documentation and a persistent identifier. Subsequently, it is decided where the data and/or metadata will be archived for sustainable accessibility.  This does not necessarily mean that the data is available to everyone, see Data Sharing. Global accessible data archives include: DANS, 4TUdatacentrum, SURFSARA, CLARIN (NWO), EMBLEBI."
university-medical-center-utrecht.md,### 3.7. Data Sharing
university-medical-center-utrecht.md,#### 3.7.1. Accessibility
university-medical-center-utrecht.md,"In addition to open access to publications, accessibility of the underlying research data is stimulated, within the framework of the privacy legislation, the control rights of the study participants and the contractual agreements with third parties and funders.  For each separate study, the data access policy will have to be determined and described in the Data Sharing Statement (one of the principles of Research Data Management). Agreements about sharing data with a specific third party (both during the research and after publishing the research results) are contractually written in a Data Transfer Agreement."
university-medical-center-utrecht.md,#### 3.7.2. Trusted Third Party (TTP)
university-medical-center-utrecht.md,"For linking research data and data from external parties at patient level, a TTP is used, or, if possible, similar technological or procedural solutions within the UMC Utrecht."

university-of-aberdeen.md,# University of Aberdeen Research Data Management Policy Supporting Researcher-Centred Data Management at the University of Aberdeen
university-of-aberdeen.md,"As an organisation which creates and uses knowledge to make a difference, the University of Aberdeen wishes to make its research outputs (publications and the underlying research data) as freely available as possible, with the minimum of delay.  At the same time, we ensure that we meet all legislative and ethical obligations to protect the rights and privacy of individuals and minimize the potential for harm. We comply with UKRI’s Common Principles on Data Policy and the Concordat on Open Research Data.0F1"
university-of-aberdeen.md,"Managing and sharing research data effectively is fundamental to facilitating high quality research practice, supporting our commitment to research excellence and good research governance."
university-of-aberdeen.md,"The University outlines below the main principles of the policy for the appropriate management and sharing of all research data1F2 that is generated as a result of University research activity, throughout the life of the project and beyond, to ensure that researchers comply with legislative, funding body, data owner, and internal policy and audit requirements, and that, where appropriate, the data remains discoverable, available and usable over time, for future validation, access and re-use."
university-of-aberdeen.md,"The University aims to support the open research agenda for both data and publications to make data more accessible to researchers and to share resources across institutions in order to create impact, recognition, curation, and influence, and ensure longevity and visibility."
university-of-aberdeen.md,## Scope
university-of-aberdeen.md,"The policy applies to all staff that are authorised to use the University’s name and services in the course of their research, including postgraduate students and visiting, honorary, and emeritus staff.  It also applies to staff supervising student research projects. University use of NHS and clinical data is subject to additional governance."
university-of-aberdeen.md,## Roles and Responsibilities
university-of-aberdeen.md,"1. The Principal Investigator (PI) is responsible for compliance with this and related policies, research data management practice2F3 deposition and publication, in accordance with relevant University policies, legislation, funder, and data owner terms and conditions.  Where the research is externally funded, and the funders allow, the Principal Investigator is responsible for the recovery of costs of data storage and curation.  Principal Investigators are also required to participate in relevant training offered by the University of Aberdeen."
university-of-aberdeen.md,"2. All research data gathered by students during their study are the responsibility of the supervising staff member (PI/lead supervisor), to manage in accordance with the requirements of this policy and institutional guidance."
university-of-aberdeen.md,"3. Effective research data management practice3F4 is a shared responsibility between individual researchers, University management, and professional services."
university-of-aberdeen.md,"4. The University will provide support, guidance, and information on appropriate research data management activities, including planning for funding applications, availability of internal and external data repositories, licensing of datasets, and allocation of persistent identifiers for data sets.  Further guidance on the associated roles and responsibilities for this policy is available here."
university-of-aberdeen.md,### Deposit and Publication
university-of-aberdeen.md,"5. All research data of potential current or future interest, or that which substantiates published research findings, should be assessed by the Principal Investigator for deposit in an appropriate data repository."
university-of-aberdeen.md,6. The Principal Investigator has a responsibility to assess which research data should be offered for deposit; to identify an appropriate repository; to specify appropriate levels of access to the data; and to consult relevant third parties (e.g. research participants; academic and non-academic partners) in making these decisions.
university-of-aberdeen.md,"7. Research data should be published/made publicly accessible as soon as possible, and typically on publication of the results.  Embargo periods are acceptable and should take account of funders’ requirements, disciplinary practice, and commercial value.  It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator or successor data owner to adhere to funder requirements for data publishing and, where necessary, to negotiate an extension to restrictions on placing data in the public domain."
university-of-aberdeen.md,"8. When a data set is published, the Principal Investigator or data owner is required to select an appropriate licence under which their data will be made available.  The Principal Investigator or data owner will need to ensure that the licence permits sharing and re-use of data in accordance with funder requirements and the terms and conditions of this policy.  Institutional support and guidance are available here.  Electronic data published in the institutional repository will be catalogued using structured metadata which includes details of licencing and a persistent digital object identifier (DOI)."
university-of-aberdeen.md,"9. The University of Aberdeen retains the right to re-use research data or make it openly available for others to re-use.  Exclusive rights to re-use or publish research data should therefore not be handed over to commercial publishers or agents without retaining the rights to make the data openly available for re-use, unless this is a condition of funding or other agreed third-party rights."
university-of-aberdeen.md,"10. A central record of known datasets deposited in public access repositories, including our institutional repositories, will be maintained in the institutional research information system.  The deposit of a data set in an external publicly accessible repository should be notified to (opendata@abdn.ac.uk)  to enable the cataloguing of metadata."
university-of-aberdeen.md,### Data Management Practice
university-of-aberdeen.md,"11. All personal data4F5 must be collected and managed in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation ((EU) 2016/679) and the UK Data Protection Act 2018, or successive legislation. Standards and procedures for processing personal data are set out in the University of Aberdeen Data Protection Policy."
university-of-aberdeen.md,"12. Where required, research proposals should include a Data Management Plan 5F6 (DMP), or equivalent protocol for the management of data, that addresses key elements of data management practice throughout the research project and for the longer term."
university-of-aberdeen.md,"13. Data retention, preservation, accessibility, and deletion will be managed in line with relevant legislation, policies, contractual obligations, funder requirements and, where appropriate, in line with consent obtained from research subjects."
university-of-aberdeen.md,"13.1 Holding data for longitudinal studies or to enable data collection and aggregation over time, as defined by the project, can also be considered, but must take account of all the above."
university-of-aberdeen.md,"13.2 In any case, data should be retained for a minimum of 5 years from project end date."
university-of-aberdeen.md,13.3 Data should not be kept any longer than is necessary without reasonable justification and appropriate authorisation/consent.
university-of-aberdeen.md,"14. Where funders allow, all costs associated with data management practice should be recovered from funders."

university-of-abertay-dundee.md,6. Research publications must include a data access statement.
university-of-abertay-dundee.md,"7. In line with UKRI policies, researchers are entitled to a limited period of privileged access to the data they collect to allow them to work on and publish their results."
university-of-abertay-dundee.md,"8. Data that cannot be digitised must also be registered in Pure, stored securely and organised in a manner that would facilitate it being shared in the event of a valid request for access being received."
university-of-abertay-dundee.md,"9. Use of others’ data should always conform to legal, ethical and regulatory frameworks including appropriate acknowledgement."
university-of-abertay-dundee.md,"10. Data must always be managed, throughout its lifecycle, in compliance with all relevant legal, ethical, and regulatory frameworks, and in the case of personal information, the provisions of legislation and University policy relating to GDPR."
university-of-abertay-dundee.md,## Research Data Management Policy
university-of-abertay-dundee.md,### Purpose
university-of-abertay-dundee.md,"This policy aims to ensure that our research data management practices meet the highest standards and are aligned with the UKRI Research Council Common Principles on Data Policy1, and the Concordat on Open Research Data.2 It sets out the University’s expectations so that all stakeholders recognise their responsibilities and obligations and can contribute to data being maintained and preserved as identifiable, discoverable, retrievable and reusable assets."
university-of-abertay-dundee.md,### Scope
university-of-abertay-dundee.md,"This policy is binding on all University members engaged in research, including staff and research students, and those who are conducting research on behalf of the University. The Policy does not apply to postgraduate taught and undergraduate students, except where their research findings are included in published research outputs."
university-of-abertay-dundee.md,### Implementation
university-of-abertay-dundee.md,"An evolutionary approach will be taken to implementing this policy with a target date of 2022 set for full implementation. A research data roadmap will help the University achieve this goal and progress will be reviewed regularly. Initially, priority will be given to ensuring funder requirements are met and/or to research where the results have potential for publication. For funded projects, the requirements of this policy are mandatory from the date of this policy onwards."
university-of-abertay-dundee.md,"The University expects all research data with potential long-term value will eventually be managed to the same standards, but recognises that extending the scope of this policy beyond those engaged in funded research will be a longer-term endeavour."
university-of-abertay-dundee.md,"In light of the pace of change in this field, this policy will be reviewed 12-months from the date of approval."
university-of-abertay-dundee.md,### Principles
university-of-abertay-dundee.md,"1. Good data management is fundamental to all stages of the research process and the highest standards must be applied throughout the data lifecycle, from creation to preservation or disposal."
university-of-abertay-dundee.md,2. Data with acknowledged long-term value should be preserved and be made discoverable and openly available with as few restrictions as possible in a timely and responsible manner.
university-of-abertay-dundee.md,"3. Open access will not be possible in cases where there are justified and justifiable legal, ethical and commercial constraints on data release."
university-of-abertay-dundee.md,4. Conditions of grant from individual funding bodies with specific guidelines and obligations will take precedence in the event of any uncertainty on a project’s data management requirements.
university-of-abertay-dundee.md,5. The researchers’ entitlement to be the first to publish based on data they have generated will b preserved.
university-of-abertay-dundee.md,# Abertay University
university-of-abertay-dundee.md,## Research Data Management Policy
university-of-abertay-dundee.md,"6. It is recognised that types of data used, collected and generated will vary between disciplines and therefore the application of this policy will be sensitive to these differences while ensuring that best practice is promoted and funder requirements are met."
university-of-abertay-dundee.md,"7. Researchers need to be aware of best practice measures for personal data collection, handling, security and sharing (including the appropriate deployment of anonymisation and related techniques and the creation of codebooks for their accompanying datafiles (e.g. a .txt file) so that data can be used/understood by third parties)."
university-of-abertay-dundee.md,### Research Data Management Policy
university-of-abertay-dundee.md,"### Before a project begins, a research Data Management Plan (DMP) must be completed"
university-of-abertay-dundee.md,1. All research proposals must include a DMP that should be kept up-to-date as the project progresses.
university-of-abertay-dundee.md,2. Plans should explicitly cover: ownership; standards/methodologies for data collection and management; ethical and privacy issues (including GDPR considerations if any personal data is involved); short-term storage and long-term preservation and/or deletion; data sharing and access/ temporary or long-term restrictions.
university-of-abertay-dundee.md,"3. Where research is undertaken in partnership or under contract with a third party, a collaboration agreement must be signed before the start of the research that clearly addresses data ownership and partner responsibility for data storage."
university-of-abertay-dundee.md,"Data collected during a project where the University is responsible for data storage must be stored on the University network, to ensure that it is suitably protected against accidental loss or damage and against unauthorised access"
university-of-abertay-dundee.md,"1. The University provides a secure Research Data Storage Service (RDSS) for this purpose, which ensures that only authorised staff can access project data, and that data can be restored in the event of accidental loss or damage."
university-of-abertay-dundee.md,"2. Temporary use of portable devices and storage and/or the University’s approved cloud service during, for example, field research, processing or collaboration must comply with the University’s Data Storage Policy."
university-of-abertay-dundee.md,"3. Data placed on temporary storage must be transferred back onto the RDSS as soon as the requirement for temporary storage has ended, to minimise the risk of reputational damage and/or litigation caused from lost, stolen or intercepted data."
university-of-abertay-dundee.md,4. Research proposals should consider whether storage requirements may exceed those currently offered by the University. Any such potential requirement should be discussed in advance of the application with both Information Services (infrastructure) and REIS (funding).
university-of-abertay-dundee.md,# Abertay University
university-of-abertay-dundee.md,## Research Data Management Policy
university-of-abertay-dundee.md,5. For datasets generated by simulation only the source code used to generate that data should be stored on the RDSS.
university-of-abertay-dundee.md,6. Before staff leave the university data of long-term value produced using University resources must remain accessible to the University.
university-of-abertay-dundee.md,7. Data containing personal information must be managed in accordance with the requirements of GDPR legislation and the document “Complying with GDPR at Abertay: Research Policy”. The key points relating to management of personal data have been reproduced in the Appendix.
university-of-abertay-dundee.md,"### After a project, data with acknowledged long-term value must be preserved and made openly accessible, with as few restrictions as possible unless there are compelling reasons not to be so"
university-of-abertay-dundee.md,"1. At the completion of a project, the project lead must assess what data are of long-term value, and whether the data can be made openly available in a manner consistent with relevant legal, ethical and regulatory frameworks."
university-of-abertay-dundee.md,"2. If research data are to be deleted or destroyed, this should be done in accordance with all legal, ethical and funder requirements and with particular concern for confidentiality and security."
university-of-abertay-dundee.md,"3. Retained data suitable for external access should, where possible, be stored on a suitable national or international data service or subject domain repository (which may be specified by the funder)."
university-of-abertay-dundee.md,"4. If the funder does not specify a repository for data storage, and no suitable publisher, or discipline-specific archive is available, the University will provide a storage solution for long-term preservation and, if applicable, public access."
university-of-abertay-dundee.md,"5. Data that supports published results must be preserved for 10 years from the date of publication of the findings, or longer if required by the funder."
university-of-abertay-dundee.md,"6. Data that supports published results must be deposited no later than publication of the findings. Where the funder requires an earlier deposit, the timeframes specified by the funder take precedence."
university-of-abertay-dundee.md,"7. In the case of research involving personal information, only anonymised data may be included in an open access dataset."
university-of-abertay-dundee.md,"### After a project, a metadata record describing retained data must be made publically available via Pure, within 12 months of the data being generated"
university-of-abertay-dundee.md,1. A central catalogue of all preserved data will be published via Pure within 12 months of the data being generated (irrespective of where the data is hosted or whether it is publically accessible).

university-of-abertay-dundee.md,10. Data placed on temporary storage must be transferred back onto the RDSS as soon as the requirement for temporary storage has ended.
university-of-abertay-dundee.md,"11. Any ‘keys’ that could be used in combination with a data file to identify an individual should be shredded, as soon as possible upon project completion, if this key is no longer of use for the research project."
university-of-abertay-dundee.md,"Further information on GDPR compliance, including the University’s requirements for consent forms, anonymization, retention and timely disposal, audit trails and use of survey tools, can be found in Complying with GPDR at Abertay: Research Policy Document"
university-of-bern.md,# Research Data Management Guideline
university-of-bern.md,"With this guideline on Research Data Management (RDM), the data stewards at the Open Science Team in the University Library of Bern aim to support researchers from all faculties at the University of Bern and Insel Hospital in research data management throughout the project life cycle. This includes dealing with ethical data collection, data reuse, data generation and data processing, data documentation, and preparing data and metadata, as well as code, and software for publication."
university-of-bern.md,"Research Data of high quality is an essential resource for science and society. Research Data Management (RDM) is a part of good scientific practice according to nationally and internationally recognized standards for scientific integrity. Good RDM enhances the robustness of research outputs, facilitates research collaborations, makes research results more reproducible, and strengthens society’s trust in science."
university-of-bern.md,## 1. Planning of Research Data Management
university-of-bern.md,"The Data Management Plan (DMP) is a document and tool (Annex A, C, D), and guideline for researchers themselves to facilitate the implementation of good RDM practices in their projects throughout the whole project life cycle, including the reporting, as well as for planning the storage and safeguarding of data."
university-of-bern.md,The DMP stipulations issued by funding agencies must be strictly adhered to. The responsibility for this lies with the grantee(s).
university-of-bern.md,## 2. Data collection and processing
university-of-bern.md,"Before data collection, data types should be identified. Sensitive (e.g., coded patient data or patient genomic data) and some non-sensitive data (e.g., animal data, plant tissues and / or seeds, soil etc.) all need authorized permissions, which must be obtained before data collection (Annex A, E)."
university-of-bern.md,"Data volume should be roughly estimated, considering raw, re-processed and analysed data may have a different data volume, therefore, more space for data storage may be needed. This should be considered before and during data collection."
university-of-bern.md,## 3. Data documentation and metadata
university-of-bern.md,"The structure and the processing steps of all research data must be systemically documented in a digital, logical manner in order to ensure adherence to the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) principles1,2."
university-of-bern.md,"The documentation includes general information like title of dataset; contributor information; date of data collection; geographic location of data collection; keywords describing the subject of the dataset; information about funding sources that supported the collection of the data; a codebook, lab journal and special software (Annex B)."
university-of-bern.md,"## 4. Data storage, security and backup"
university-of-bern.md,"Consult group / laboratory guidelines describing where raw, reprocessed, analysed, unpublished and published data and / or the corresponding protocols, surveys, paper data and samples are stored, as well as get in touch with the IT-Department of the University of Bern to ensure storage process and location (Annex A4)."
university-of-bern.md,"## 5. Ethical, legal and security issues"
university-of-bern.md,"Research projects conducted in Switzerland are subject to data protection law (cantonal data protection law, in some cases additionally the national data protection law) as well as special legal provisions on data protection under the Human Research Act (HRA) (Annex A2). The use of data in research projects within the scope of the HRA requires permission from the cantonal ethics commission Bern (CEC, Swissethics, Swissmedic) (Annex A8). The HRA's scope includes all methodled research on physical and mental illnesses in humans and on the structure and function of the human body, with the aim of gaining generalizable knowledge. The HRA's scope includes all methodled research on physical and mental illnesses in humans and on the structure and function of the human body, with the aim of gaining generalizable knowledge."
university-of-bern.md,"Use of (coded) patient samples or data for research purposes is only permitted if written consent has been obtained (General or Informed Consent, respectively). The signed consent and a potential electronic Informed Consent (eIC) should be collected and stored separately from the coded sample/data, to avoid person identification."
university-of-bern.md,"Research projects that do not fall within the scope of the HRA do not need permission from the cantonal ethics committee but are required to get legal authorization before an experiment can be conducted (e.g., animal studies). Depending on the project and institution, special provisions may apply for obtaining authorizations (Annex A8)."
university-of-bern.md,"According to the law (see Art. 70 Bern University Act, Annex A4; Art. 60 on the Law on Personnel (Personalgesetz; Annex A5), research results and outputs obtained at the University of Bern belong to the University. If data are obtained at different Universities, then joint ownership should be applied (see Unitectra, Annex A5). For clarification of details, please contact the legal services office at UniBE (Annex A2)."
university-of-bern.md,"## 6. Publication of Research Data, Programming Code and Software"
university-of-bern.md,"To follow the good scientific practice, research data should be published according to the principle “as open as possible, as closed as necessary”. Research data and programming code both are relevant and requested to be shared along with the publication under a “Research Data and Code Availability Statement”. They should be published and deposited in a FAIR research data repository along with rich metadata information (see section 3, Annex E4). If data cannot be openly published due to ethical or legal restrictions then a Data Transfer Agreement is recommended to upload along with the metadata and supplementary documentation material about the dataset, which will allow other researchers to understand and reuse the data (Annex A1,2 E)."

university-of-cambridge.md,# University of Cambridge Research Data Management Policy Framework
university-of-cambridge.md,Last updated: 11th February 2021
university-of-cambridge.md,"The purpose of this policy framework is to provide guidance to research staff and students as to how they should manage and share the research data they produce in order to maximise the potential for research produced by the University of Cambridge in support of the University’s core values and missions. This policy framework is intended for researchers, research students and anyone who supports research at the University of Cambridge."
university-of-cambridge.md,## Background
university-of-cambridge.md,"1. The University of Cambridge is committed to disseminating its research and scholarship as widely as possible. In keeping with that commitment, it supports the principle that the results of its research should be freely accessible where possible and where appropriate, and therefore supports its staff and students in making their research data available ‘as open as possible and as closed as necessary’, as articulated in the University’s Open Research Position Statement."
university-of-cambridge.md,"2. University staff and students are responsible for managing and curating their research data in accordance with the University Open Research Position Statement, the  policies of their research funders, the University’s Research Policies, the University’s Research Integrity and Ethics guidelines, the University’s Statement of Records Management Practice and Retention Schedule and Chapter XIII of the University’s Statutes and Ordinances on Finance and Property, subsection Intellectual Property Rights. Key aspects of these documents are incorporated into this policy framework."
university-of-cambridge.md,3. This policy framework will be reviewed annually by the Open Research Steering Committee and may therefore be subject to change.
university-of-cambridge.md,4. The following terms used in this policy framework can be defined as follows:
university-of-cambridge.md,"Research data – “the evidence that underpins the answer to the research question, and can be used to validate findings regardless of its form (e.g. print, digital, or physical). These might be quantitative information or qualitative statements collected by researchers [staff, students or those supporting research] in the course of their work by experimentation, observation, modelling, interview or other methods, or information derived from existing evidence. Data may be raw or primary (e.g. direct from measurement or collection) or derived from primary data for subsequent analysis or interpretation (e.g. cleaned up or as an extract from a larger data set), or derived from existing sources where the rights may be held by others.”[1]"
university-of-cambridge.md,"Manual research records – manual research records are any non-electronic documents and materials, regardless of format, which facilitate the research activities carried out by the University. This can include both the data underpinning research as well as records relating to research quality, standards and governance; research project development and management; and research commercialization. See section 4 of the Statement of Records Management Practice and Master Records Retention Schedule for details of the specific kinds of records which fall under these categories along with their respective retention periods."
university-of-cambridge.md,"Research staff and students - research staff are individuals undertaking academic research either in direct employment of the University or under formal agreement with the University in another capacity (e.g. retired staff) regardless of where that research is taking place, whether in Cambridge or elsewhere; research students are individuals who are undertaking academic research at the University in pursuit of a postgraduate degree or other award."
university-of-cambridge.md,"Active data – “Research data files that are in the process of continuous change and/or development. Files containing this data are accessed, amended and/or updated as new data is gathered and/or processed. Some datasets may never be ‘finished’. A ‘snapshot’ of active research data can be archived to create a version that is fixed and can be cited.”[2]"
university-of-cambridge.md,"Data Management Plan – a plan that outlines how data will be managed from the point of collection at the start of a research project all the way through to what will happen to the data once the project finishes. Typically a data management plan (DMP) will cover areas such as collection strategy, backup and storage of data, ethical/legal requirements related to data, data sharing and data archiving."
university-of-cambridge.md,"Metadata – information that describes significant aspects of a dataset. For example, this may include authors, title, date of publication, unique identifier, a description of what the dataset contains and licence. This provides other researchers with the information needed to understand and reuse the dataset as well as making the dataset more findable"
university-of-cambridge.md,## Principles
university-of-cambridge.md,5. Reproducibility of research is a central tenet of the University and all researchers are expected to conduct their work in a rigorous manner.
university-of-cambridge.md,"6. The University recognises the importance of the long-term availability, with as few restrictions as possible, and long-term preservation of all research outputs including research data."
university-of-cambridge.md,"7. As detailed in the University’s Open Research Position Statement, the University is committed to implementing procedures that are discipline-appropriate, proportionate, evidence-based, practical, cost-effective and sustainable, and in the best interests of enhancing its mission, in order to disseminate research and scholarship as widely as possible from research publications to all forms of research data."
university-of-cambridge.md,"8. The University is committed to achieving compliance with the data policies of its external research sponsors, publishers and governmental agencies, and requires its research staff and students to abide by terms and conditions agreed with third parties. The University also recognises that such third parties’ policies are evolving and that they may require higher levels of data accessibility and dissemination in the future."
university-of-cambridge.md,"9. As detailed in the Open Research Position Statement the University recognises that “[a]cross the disciplinary spectrum there are a wide range of cultural settings that influence both capacity for and appropriateness of fully Open Research“ and it “encourages outputs of research, and where appropriate the accompanying data, to be ‘as open as possible, as closed as necessary’.”."
university-of-cambridge.md,10. The University recognises that there is a balance between openness and duties under professional codes and legal obligations.
university-of-cambridge.md,11. This policy framework applies to all research conducted by University staff and research students.
university-of-cambridge.md,12. The University supports the Concordat on Open Data and works in line with the FAIR principles. It is working towards embedding these across the institution.
university-of-cambridge.md,### The University is responsible for:
university-of-cambridge.md,"13. Disseminating information amongst its academics about the requirements under this policy framework and under policies of the University’s funders in relation to research data. Schools, Departments and Faculties are expected to be proactive in disseminating these requirements within their communities and encouraging and facilitating compliance."
university-of-cambridge.md,"14. Developing and supporting infrastructure and services that enable good research data management to be practised across the institution.  This includes, but is not limited to, infrastructure such as active data storage options, the University Apollo repository, the research information system, and services such as the Office of Scholarly Communication, Cambridge University Libraries, University Information Services, Research Office and Cambridge Enterprise."
university-of-cambridge.md,15. Providing training and guidance to promote best practice in data management and sharing amongst its research staff and students.
university-of-cambridge.md,"16. Managing a website providing guidance for the University’s academics in good data management practice, including the use of electronic lab notebooks."
university-of-cambridge.md,"17. Providing advice and guidance on issues connected with good data management, such as data protection, research integrity, research ethics and Intellectual Property rights."
university-of-cambridge.md,### University Research Staff and Students are responsible for:
university-of-cambridge.md,PLANNING
university-of-cambridge.md,"18. Principal Investigator(s) should establish and maintain clear research data management responsibilities within their research group to ensure good data management is practised throughout the project and by all group members.

university-of-central-lancashire.md,## Research Data Management Policy
university-of-central-lancashire.md,### 1. Introduction and purpose
university-of-central-lancashire.md,"In reference to institutional research policies it is useful to define what constitutes research. UCLan defines research in line with the Frascati Manual definition of research and experimental development1 and in accordance with the REF2021 definition; “research is defined as a process of investigation leading to new insights, effectively shared”"
university-of-central-lancashire.md,"As an institution, UCLan fully supports open research and open practice.  Research data generated at the University is recognised as an institutional asset that when shared openly not only increases the visibility of UCLan’s research but also facilitates public engagement and creates new opportunities for knowledge exchange and collaboration."
university-of-central-lancashire.md,"In order to be made open access, research data must be created and managed with sharing in mind at every stage of the research process, from planning to publication."
university-of-central-lancashire.md,"This research data management policy clarifies the University’s expectations concerning the management, storage, publication and sharing of research data. This Policy reflects the University’s intention to establish good research data management practice throughout the research lifecycle as part of the institution’s commitment to research excellence.  The policy provides a strategic framework for the management and governance of research data generated by research activities at UCLan and aims to contribute to readiness for future Research Excellence Framework exercise or similar requirements."
university-of-central-lancashire.md,### 2. Purpose of the research data management policy
university-of-central-lancashire.md,"Ensure the University and its research communities are compliant with current academic and funder requirements such as the UK Research and Innovation Common Principles on Data Policy, the Wellcome Trust Policy on Data"

university-of-central-lancashire.md,"All academics at UCLan who produce or work with data generated as a result of research, regardless of how that research is funded;"
university-of-central-lancashire.md,All academics who supervise or co-supervise postgraduate research students; All postgraduate research students.
university-of-central-lancashire.md,### 4. Policy Awareness
university-of-central-lancashire.md,"All researchers should familiarise themselves with relevant UCLan policies, in particular this Research Data Management Policy, the Open Access Policy2, the Policies on Intellectual Property for staff and students3, the Data Protection Policy4 and UCLan’s Ethical Principles for Teaching, Research, Consultancy, Knowledge Transfer and Related Activities5."
university-of-central-lancashire.md,"Externally-funded researchers must ensure compliance with their funder’s policy on research data management and data publication.  In cases where researchers may be affected by a number of policies, funder policy should take precedence."
university-of-central-lancashire.md,### 5. Data Management Planning
university-of-central-lancashire.md,"All researchers should develop a data management plan (DMP) at the outset of their research project, regardless of whether it is funded or not funded.  The DMP should form the basis of data management throughout the various stages of the research lifecycle."
university-of-central-lancashire.md,## University of Central Lancashire UCLan
university-of-central-lancashire.md,Grants and Funding Unit (GFU) will advise whether a research funder requires a DMP to be included in the grant application.
university-of-central-lancashire.md,"DMPs should address the creation, management, storage and sharing of research data and the production of descriptive metadata to aid discovery and re-use.  Researchers should use the UCLan, funder or generic DPM templates available in the Digital Curation Centre’s DMPonline6."
university-of-central-lancashire.md,"Where a DMP is a requirement of funding or grant application/s, researchers must work with the Research Data Management Officer and GFU to ensure they are following good practice in research data management and to develop DMPs of a consistently high standard."
university-of-central-lancashire.md,Research data must be stored appropriately and securely throughout the life of the research project in accordance with guidance from LIS. See;  IT Security policy and Sharing documents and Data policy
university-of-central-lancashire.md,Researchers likely to generate very large datasets exceeding storage provided as standard by the institution7 must work with the Research Data Management Officer and Learning and Information Services (LIS) to identify a satisfactory storage solution.
university-of-central-lancashire.md,"Researchers should ensure that the costs of research data management and any additional data storage required are included in grant applications to external funders, where permitted."
university-of-central-lancashire.md,"Unfunded researchers must be able to cover the cost of excessive data requirements (beyond standard availability) through Faculty or School budgets, and this must be agreed before commencement of research."
university-of-central-lancashire.md,### 6. Roles and Responsibilities
university-of-central-lancashire.md,#### 6.1 The University
university-of-central-lancashire.md,"The University is responsible for the provision of a managed repository service for secure archiving, preservation and long-term storage of completed digital research data and open access research publications, including journal articles and conference papers.  The University provides training, support and advice on all aspects of research data management."
university-of-central-lancashire.md,#### 6.2 Researchers
university-of-central-lancashire.md,Overall responsibility for research data management during any research project lies with the most senior UCLan researcher (the Data Steward for the project).  In cases where the project is led by an external partner there is still a requirement for data generated or shared by UCLan to be managed by a named individual at UCLan.
university-of-central-lancashire.md,## University of Central Lancashire UCLan
university-of-central-lancashire.md,"The Data Steward of any externally-funded project should meet with the Research Data Management Officer at regular intervals during the project lifetime, to be agreed at the post-award meeting."
university-of-central-lancashire.md,"Lead UCLan authors of published research are responsible for ensuring compliance with funder and University policy regarding open access to research papers and the underlying data.  Published papers must acknowledge funders, where applicable, and include a short statement describing how and on what terms any supporting research datasets may be accessed."
university-of-central-lancashire.md,#### 6.2.1 Doctoral Supervisors
university-of-central-lancashire.md,"Where a researcher supervises doctoral students he/she should be aware of supervisor responsibilities with regard to ensuring retention of key PGR datasets. They should follow the guidelines within the UCLan Code of Practice Relating to the Supervision, Examination and Administration of Research Degrees  and the Graduate School guiding principles for Research Supervisors,8 specifically; •To assist PGRs with identifying any IP rights arising in or from their work and keeping this under regular review throughout the programme of study; •To ensure the appropriate storage or deletion of PGR student data following completion of studies; •To ensure that upon completion of studies PGRs remove and dispose of all data, equipment, materials and personal belongings appropriately and in a timely fashion; •To arrange appropriate storage and/or archiving of PGR student data upon completion of studies; •To advise PGRs of the requirement to ensure their thesis, plus relevant data is deposited into the institutional repository"
university-of-central-lancashire.md,#### 6.2.2 Postgraduate Research Students
university-of-central-lancashire.md,"Primary responsibility for the management of data produced during research activities lies with the student, overseen by the Director of Studies/Supervisory Team"
university-of-central-lancashire.md,#### 6.3 Intellectual Property Rights
university-of-central-lancashire.md,Ownership of intellectual property (IP) created by UCLan staff is outlined in the University Policy on Intellectual Property (Section 3). IP which has potential exploitation (commercial and non-commercial)  or publicity value or could otherwise enhance the reputation of UCLan should be identified and disclosed to the University at the earliest opportunity.  The associated data may need to be withheld for a limited period of time (see point 6) to protect IP that would otherwise be compromised.
university-of-central-lancashire.md,## University of Central Lancashire UCLan
university-of-central-lancashire.md,#### 6.4. External Collaborations and Contracts
university-of-central-lancashire.md,"Where a project involves external collaborators, the lead organisation is responsible for putting appropriate formal agreements in place covering the contributions and rights of the various organisations and individuals involved.  All such agreements should be reviewed and approved by the University before the project begins."
university-of-central-lancashire.md,"Except where this is a condition of funding, exclusive rights to research data must not be handed, sold or licensed to external parties."
university-of-central-lancashire.md,### 7. Data Sharing and Preservation
university-of-central-lancashire.md,All researchers should familiarise themselves with and comply with GDPR and DPA regulations on data sharing.
university-of-central-lancashire.md,Data that has been selected for retention should not be deposited with any organisation that does not commit to its access and availability for reuse unless this is a condition of funding or would prevent commercial interests.
university-of-central-lancashire.md,"All digital research data that has been selected by the Data Steward or research group for retention should be deposited in the UCLan data repository or a suitable national or international data service or subject repository within 12 months of generation.  As a minimum, where a dataset underpins published research, every effort must be made to ensure its availability on open access at the date of publication or before."
university-of-central-lancashire.md,"Research data that has been selected for retention should be registered with UCLan’s data repository, even where the data has been deposited in an external repository or if the data is not suitable for open access.  Datasets can be registered by creating a metadata-only record which must contain a stable link, preferably a digital object identifier (DOI) to the externally-held data, where applicable."
university-of-central-lancashire.md,"Funders typically regard non-deposit of research data as an exception therefore researchers should make every effort throughout the project to ensure data can be shared openly.  Legitimate reasons for non-deposit of data include ethical, legal and commercial constraints; where feasible, issues preventing data sharing should be identified prior to data generation."
university-of-central-lancashire.md,"The funder should always be made aware of any constraints on access and researchers must be prepared to provide evidence justifying non-deposit.  Where the risk has a limited time span, researchers should ensure a publication plan is in place.  Data that is withheld or temporarily embargoed should still be managed and held in a format that would permit sharing in event of, for example, a Freedom of Information request or random audit by a funder."
university-of-central-lancashire.md,"If the research data are to be deleted or destroyed, for example because its agreed period of retention has expired or due to ethical or legal reasons, this should be done so in accordance with all legal, ethical, research funder and collaborator requirements, and with particular concern for confidentiality and security. Any action taken should be documented and retrievable, for possible future audit."
university-of-central-lancashire.md,### 8. Sensitive Data
university-of-central-lancashire.md,"The University’s  Ethical Principles for Teaching, Research, Consultancy, Knowledge Transfer and Related Activities provides guidance on approaches to handling sensitive data.  Where research involves the collection of personal data, researchers should work within the guidelines set out in UCLan’s Data Protection Policy"
university-of-central-lancashire.md,#### 8.1 Security-sensitive Data
university-of-central-lancashire.md,"Security-sensitive research material relates to any data - digital or analogue - that can be interpreted as contravening counter-terrorism legislation under the Terrorism Act (2006)9. This Act outlaws the dissemination of records, statements and other documents that can be interpreted as promoting or endorsing terrorist acts or extremism; making explosives/radioactive devices that have a military (or hazardous) purpose and trespass on nuclear sites; and IT encryption design that could pose as a threat to national security."
university-of-central-lancashire.md,Any such data must be stored and managed off the University network and according to guidelines set out in the Universities UK document ‘Oversight of security-sensitive research material in UK universities’10.  Researchers and research students working with or generating security-sensitive data must liaise with the Research Data Management Officer to ensure compliance with Government regulations.
university-of-central-lancashire.md,### 9. Policy Review
university-of-central-lancashire.md,The University Research and Innovation Committee will be responsible for approving this policy as recommended by the Open Research Steering Group.  The policy will be reviewed at least annually by the Open Research Steering Group and updated as deemed necessary.
university-of-central-lancashire.md,Next Review date January 2022
university-of-copenhagen.md,# Policy for Research Data Management
university-of-copenhagen.md,## 1. Preface
university-of-copenhagen.md,### 1.1 Introduction
university-of-copenhagen.md,"Research data management is a collective term for the planning, collection, storage, sharing and preservation of research data, and it therefore covers the entire research data lifecycle (Figure 1). Good management of research data contributes to improved efficiency and transparency of research processes, and to increased reliability and reproducibility of research results. Thorough planning can ensure compliance with legislation, promote a clear division of responsibilities between collaborators, and safeguard secure storage and handling of data to prevent loss or misuse. For the individual researcher, good data management can lead to improved visibility and impact of their research, for example by facilitating the reuse of their data sets by others."
university-of-copenhagen.md,Figure 1. An illustration of a research data lifecycle
university-of-copenhagen.md,### 1.2 Purpose
university-of-copenhagen.md,"The policy’s objective is to outline requirements for the management of research data, and enable researchers and students to follow good scientific practice within their discipline, while adhering to laws covering research data management. The University of Copenhagen (UCPH) is committed to the highest standards of excellence in research and will support the competences necessary to adhere to this policy through training, support, advice, guidelines, tools and templates for research data management, where appropriate."
university-of-copenhagen.md,### 1.3 Scope
university-of-copenhagen.md,"1.3.1 This policy is relevant to anyone conducting or supporting research activities at the University of Copenhagen. Among others, this includes scientific staff, PhD students, visiting and affiliate researchers, collectively referred to as researchers. It includes research support staff, such as laboratory technicians and data managers, when they manage research data as part of research projects at UCPH. Lastly, it includes students in the following situations: 1) when they carry out their own research projects as part of their Bachelor’s or Master’s degree programmes and 2) when they contribute to research projects at UCPH, for example in the role of project member or employed student assistant."
university-of-copenhagen.md,"1.3.2 The policy covers physical material and digital data collected, observed, generated, created or reused as part of research activities conducted at UCPH, collectively referred to as research data in this policy unless specifically stated otherwise. This includes any physical material and digital data that form the basis of the research, such as specimens, notebooks, interviews, texts and literature, digital raw data, recordings and computer code, as well as the detailed records of these materials and data that comprise the basis for the analysis underlying the results."
university-of-copenhagen.md,"This policy applies to all research data collected, observed, generated, created or reused after 11 January 2022 (the publication date of this policy). It does not cover data collected and used solely for teaching activities1."
university-of-copenhagen.md,"1.3.3 The policy adheres to the relevant legislation and follows the Danish Code of Conduct for Research Integrity, the UCPH Code of Conduct for Responsible Research as well as other university policies, such as the Information Security Policy and the Policy on Research Planning and Conduct."
university-of-copenhagen.md,"1.3.4 In relation to the specific research area and the individual research project, it must be assessed whether and to what extent the data management policy, or parts of the policy, are relevant."
university-of-copenhagen.md,### 1.4 Faculty implementation
university-of-copenhagen.md,"The faculties (deans) are responsible for the implementation of this policy at the faculties. Deans must ensure that a plan and a timeline for the implementation of this policy are developed at their faculty (also see 3.5). Where necessary, faculties, departments, research groups, PhD schools, etc. may introduce more specific requirements, procedures and guidelines for the implementation of the policy according to local practice."
university-of-copenhagen.md,## 2. Principles
university-of-copenhagen.md,### 2.1 Data management plans
university-of-copenhagen.md,"2.1.1 The management of research data must be thoroughly considered before physical materials and digital data are collected, observed, generated, created or reused. Data management plans (DMP) must be developed and documented, preferably in electronic format. As a minimum, the topics addressed in this policy (clauses 2.2-2.7) must be reviewed, for example by using the DMP template provided at UCPH. DMPs should be updated when significant changes to the management of research data occur and (references to) the DMP should be stored with the corresponding research data as long as they exist."
university-of-copenhagen.md,"2.1.2 The DMP should be discussed with project collaborators, research managers and supervisors (if any), ensuring that agreements are reached regarding responsibilities for different research data management activities during and after research projects."
university-of-copenhagen.md,### 2.2 Rights to research data
university-of-copenhagen.md,"2.2.1 Rights to research data must be clarified at the start of research projects. Unless legislation states otherwise, or agreements have been made to determine otherwise, the following is the default at UCPH:"
university-of-copenhagen.md,"a. In accordance with the general rules of copyright during employment, researchers hold the copyright to books and articles they publish as a result of research projects carried out at UCPH."
university-of-copenhagen.md,b. UCPH holds the copyright to software created by employees during the performance of their work.
university-of-copenhagen.md,"c. UCPH holds the rights to research data in the shape of physical objects collected by researchers during their employment at UCPH, such as biological and geological samples, notebooks, paper interviews and books. These objects may not be removed without permission."
university-of-copenhagen.md,"d. A copy of digital data sets and associated metadata must remain at UCPH when employment ceases. As a minimum, this applies to data sets underlying publications."
university-of-copenhagen.md,"e. In accordance with the Danish Act on Inventions at Public Research Institutions, UCPH has the right to acquire researchers’ inventions and to ask researchers to postpone publication of such inventions for a short time period."
university-of-copenhagen.md,"In addition, the following should be clarified:"
university-of-copenhagen.md,"f. To what extent research data can be accessed in the project. For example, in projects involving personal data, it must be clarified to what extent rules of data confidentiality impose limits on data access, and how these limits will be upheld."
university-of-copenhagen.md,"g. Who can access and manage the research data, and within which timeframe."
university-of-copenhagen.md,"h. When and to what extent research data may be used for other purposes, for example in other research projects. It should be determined what rules apply if a project member leaves the project and/or UCPH."
university-of-copenhagen.md,"i. Whether research data can be shared after project end, and if so, what the terms of data reuse by others will be."
university-of-copenhagen.md,"j. Intellectual property rights, including whether the research project makes use of material that interferes with the rights of others, and how the necessary approvals should be obtained to clear these rights."
university-of-copenhagen.md,"k. The legislation, policies or agreements governing the above, including whether there are special loyalty or confidentiality obligations."
university-of-copenhagen.md,"l. Any research data management requirements by research funders, partner organisations, etc."
university-of-copenhagen.md,"2.2.2 The University’s Tech Transfer Office must be involved as early as possible in the negotiation of all third-party contracts containing provisions on intellectual property rights, such as non-disclosure agreements, material transfer agreements and collaboration agreements. Patentable inventions must be reported to the Tech Transfer Office in accordance with the Act on Inventions at Public Research Institutions."
university-of-copenhagen.md,### 2.3 Ethical and legal approvals
university-of-copenhagen.md,"2.3.1 It should be ensured that the appropriate ethical and legal approvals are obtained before the start of a project, and (references to) the approvals should be stored along with the research data, as long as they exist."
university-of-copenhagen.md,2.3.2 Strict legal and local requirements exist for projects involving personal data.
university-of-copenhagen.md,"Among others, projects in which personal data are being processed (including biobanks) must be registered at UCPH, and approvals to process personal data must as a minimum be filed in the University’s archiving system. Conditions for transfer of personal data and material between UCPH and external collaborators or a third party must be captured into agreements."
university-of-copenhagen.md,"### 2.4 Collection, processing and documentation"
university-of-copenhagen.md,"2.4.1 Research data should be collected and processed in line with best practice in the research discipline. Research projects should be documented in a way that allows them to be repeated by others. Among other things, this includes clearly and accurately describing project methodology and any equipment, software or code used."
university-of-copenhagen.md,"2.4.2 Research data should be described using appropriate metadata to facilitate searching for, the identification of, and the interpretation of the research data. Metadata should be linked to the research data as long as they exist, unless legislation or agreements state otherwise."
university-of-copenhagen.md,### 2.5 Storage and security
university-of-copenhagen.md,"2.5.1 Research data must be classified at the start of a research project on the basis of the level of sensitivity and the impact to the University if data are disclosed, altered or destroyed without authorisation. Risks to data security and of data loss should be assessed in relation to the data classification. This includes evaluating:"
university-of-copenhagen.md,a. Physical and digital access to research data
university-of-copenhagen.md,b. Risks associated with data management procedures
university-of-copenhagen.md,c. Backup requirements and backup procedures
university-of-copenhagen.md,"d. External and internal threats to data confidentiality, integrity and accessibility"
university-of-copenhagen.md,"e. Financial, regulatory and technical consequences of working with data, data storage and data preservation."
university-of-copenhagen.md,"2.5.2 Risks to data subjects’ rights and freedom must be assessed in projects involving personal data and a risk assessment must be conducted and recorded when registering projects at UCPH. In some cases with a high risk for the data subjects, a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) must also be carried out as part of the registration process."
university-of-copenhagen.md,"2.5.3 Infrastructure for storing and processing research data, and for collaborating in research projects, must be chosen in accordance with the identified risks, and in compliance with UCPH’s Information Security Policy and the legal requirements for processing personal data."
university-of-copenhagen.md,### 2.6 Data sharing
university-of-copenhagen.md,"2.6.1 Legislation or agreements may preclude research data sharing or impose conditions for sharing. Before sharing research data, the relevant approvals need to be obtained and, if necessary, the appropriate agreements set up to allow data and material sharing."
university-of-copenhagen.md,"2.6.2 By default, research data should be made openly available after project end, as a minimum for data sets underlying research publications. Concerns relating to intellectual property rights, personal data protection, information security as well as commercial and national interests and legislation must be taken into account in accordance with the principle of ‘as open as possible, as closed as necessary’.  If the research data cannot be made available, sharing the metadata associated with the research data should be considered."
university-of-copenhagen.md,"2.6.3 The FAIR principles (for findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable research objects) should be followed as much as possible when preparing digital data sets that can be shared. This includes as a minimum:"
university-of-copenhagen.md,"a. Providing open access to data (Open Data) by depositing data in a data repository, or by providing access to information on whether, when, how, and to what extent data can be accessed if data sets cannot be made openly available."
university-of-copenhagen.md,b. As much as possible using persistent identifiers (PID) and metadata (such as descriptive keywords) that help locate the data set.
university-of-copenhagen.md,"c. Communicating terms and conditions for data reuse by others, for example by attaching a data licence."
university-of-copenhagen.md,"d. Providing the information necessary to understand how data sets were created and structured, and for what purpose."
university-of-copenhagen.md,"The level of compliance with the FAIR principles, in addition to the minimum requirements"
university-of-copenhagen.md,"described above, is defined by the individual research discipline in relation to international"

university-of-cumbria.md,# Research Data Management (RDM) - Principles of Good Practice
university-of-cumbria.md,These principles apply to research data generated by University of Cumbria academic staff and researchers. They do not apply at this stage to post graduate students. The area is fast moving; the principles are based on sector guidance.
university-of-cumbria.md,"The university supports the sharing of research data as openly as possible (subject to not harming university’s intellectual property, and/or commercial rights including those of a third party)."
university-of-cumbria.md,Research data is valuable and needs managing alongside your research methodology.
university-of-cumbria.md,"RDM requirements are fundamental in future plans for the Research Excellence Framework, (REF), open access, and external funding criteria."
university-of-cumbria.md,## 1. Management
university-of-cumbria.md,Research data management (RDM) (including costs) should be considered at the earliest practical stage of the project.
university-of-cumbria.md,Construct a research data management plan using the generic University of Cumbria template or appropriate funder template
university-of-cumbria.md,Review the plan regularly to ensure that practice remains in-line with expected standards
university-of-cumbria.md,## 2. Curation
university-of-cumbria.md,"Use standardised file names, folders and version control"
university-of-cumbria.md,"Ensure security and integrity of the data, compliance with confidentiality undertakings and data protection law, and respect for ownership and intellectual property rights"
university-of-cumbria.md,The privacy and other legitimate interests of the subjects of research data must be protected. Follow the University’s Code of Practice for Research
university-of-cumbria.md,## 3. Preservation
university-of-cumbria.md,Ongoing research: use university IT data storage facilities
university-of-cumbria.md,Completed research: use university approved research data repository facilities to archive your research
university-of-cumbria.md,"data and, if required, to make it open access and discoverable"
university-of-cumbria.md,## 4. Reuse
university-of-cumbria.md,Think about the usability of your data and obtain any consents necessary for sharing
university-of-cumbria.md,All relevant data must be associated with rich metadata which meets minimum standards set out in funders’ guidance if appropriate
university-of-cumbria.md,"Research data and supporting material must be sufficient to enable other researchers to understand how it was created or acquired, and, to assess its reuse potential."
university-of-cumbria.md,Make people aware that you have created some data – have a communications plan
university-of-cumbria.md,# Benefits of making Research Data openly available (Open Access)
university-of-cumbria.md,"Visibility – more citations, more downloads, more exposure for your research"
university-of-cumbria.md,Public Good – enhances your reputation and that of the university
university-of-cumbria.md,Compliance – Many funders require it

university-of-dundee.md,# Overview
university-of-dundee.md,"The purpose of this policy is to establish a set of principles to govern the management of data arising from the research activities of the University (“Research Data”1). This policy is intended to cover active Research Data sets that are of potential current or future interest or value to the field. It will not apply where there are legitimate legal, ethical and/or commercial constraints on data use."
university-of-dundee.md,"The University recognises that there is an increased requirement from funders to manage, share and provide open access to Research Data, and acknowledges that the wider benefits of this approach can include additional public interest and funding, increased validation of results, efficiencies through data re- use and novel use of existing data."
university-of-dundee.md,"For clarity, this policy applies to all Research Data, regardless of whether the research is externally funded or subject to funder mandates. This policy applies to all staff that are authorized to use the University’s name and services in the course of their research, including post graduate students and visiting, honorary and emeritus staff. NHS and clinical trial data may be subject to additional governance as specified by the Director of R&D, Tayside Medical Sciences Centre (TASC), NHS Tayside."
university-of-dundee.md,## 1. Policy Statement Principles
university-of-dundee.md,"1.1. The University advocates the highest standards in the management, re-use and open accessibility of Research Data and subscribes to the Research Councils Common Principles on Data Policy and the Concordat on Open Research Data."
university-of-dundee.md,"1.2. The privacy, confidentiality and other legitimate interests of any participants involved in the gathering of Research Data must remain protected at all times."
university-of-dundee.md,"1.3. Where appropriate, and adhering to item 1.2, Research Data should be made openly accessible for access and re-use by others."
university-of-dundee.md,"1.4. Research Data sets that are of a sensitive nature2 are not exempt from this policy by default, but may lie outwith this policy where restrictions on data use apply. Prior to commencing research, informed consent (including consent for data sharing) should be gathered, and plans for data anonymisation and access restriction should be made."
university-of-dundee.md,"1.5. Research that is commercially funded, including clinical research sponsored3 by the University of Dundee, will lie outwith this policy only if restrictions on data use apply. Where research is jointly funded by commercial and non-commercial funders, appropriate collaboration agreements must be put in place to define ownership of the Research Data and ensure compliance with the data sharing requirements of the noncommercial funder(s)."
university-of-dundee.md,"1.6. The primary grant holder (Principal Investigator) is responsible for Research Data management and planning throughout their research project or programme. The most senior researcher associated with a project at the University of Dundee holds responsibility for the data stewardship for all Research Data relating to that project. In the absence of the senior researcher, responsibility for the data stewardship will transfer upward to the Dean of School."
university-of-dundee.md,"1.7. New research projects must include research data management plans that cover items such as: data capture, management, integrity, confidentiality, retention, sharing and publication. Any specific funding body, ethical, legal or School level requirements should be taken into account in the development of data management plans."
university-of-dundee.md,"1.8. Where there is a need to establish proprietary rights to protect the intellectual property of the University, Principal Investigators should discuss the intention to place Research Data in the public domain with Research & Innovation Services (RIS) before doing so. Every effort should be made to ensure that the timeframe to establish such rights is kept to a minimum."
university-of-dundee.md,1.9. All research data gathered by students during the course of their study are the responsibility of the supervising staff member to manage in accordance with the requirements of this policy.
university-of-dundee.md,"1.10. The Library & Learning Centre (LLC) will provide support, guidance and information on appropriate research data management activities, including planning for funding applications, availability of internal and external research data repositories, licensing of datasets and allocation of persistent identifiers for datasets."
university-of-dundee.md,## 2. Storage and Accessibility
university-of-dundee.md,"2.1. All Research Data of potential current or future interest, or that which substantiates published research findings, should be assessed by the Principal Investigator for deposition in an appropriate external or University led research data repository."
university-of-dundee.md,"2.2. The associated costs of data management, analytics, archiving and sharing should be recovered from funders in the grant application, where funder’s policies permit."
university-of-dundee.md,"2.3. Data must be stored securely, with appropriate measures taken to minimize the risk of unauthorised access, loss, destruction or theft."
university-of-dundee.md,"2.4. Where personal data sets are being used in research they shall be used in a manner compliant with the applicable data protection legislation4, or any statutory modification or re-enactment thereof. In particular:"
university-of-dundee.md,Only the absolute minimum of personal data necessary shall be processed for any project
university-of-dundee.md,The basis for lawful use of personal data shall be documented
university-of-dundee.md,Every research participant shall be given information on the project and the use of each individual participant’s information shall meet transparency
university-of-dundee.md,requirements.
university-of-dundee.md,"2.5. A central record of known datasets deposited in public access repositories, or curated by Schools, will be maintained by the LLC. Any Research Data to be deposited with external services, such as Research Council or international repositories, should therefore be made known to the LLC for recording in the University’s research information system (discovery@dundee.ac.uk). The University will ensure data continues to be discoverable and compliant with funder mandates."
university-of-dundee.md,2.6. Published research results should always include information on how to access supporting data. The LLC will provide a persistent and unique identifier for datasets (DOI) where required.
university-of-dundee.md,"2.7. The University of Dundee will respect the requirements and policies of existing and future partnerships with third parties involved in the storage and safeguarding of Research Data. NHS and clinical trial data may be subject to additional governance as specified by the R&D Director, TASC, NHS Tayside (see TASC Publication Policy)."
university-of-dundee.md,"2.8. The length of time data is stored for should be determined as part of the Research Data management planning for the project, and should adhere to any particular funding body’s requirements and any additional conditions or practices within the field. The Concordat on Open Data states “data underlying publications should be retained for 10 years from the date of any publication which fundamentally relies on the data, unless specified otherwise by the funder of the research.”"
university-of-dundee.md,"2.9. Data are to be made openly available as soon as possible, and typically on publication of results. Embargo periods are permitted, but should adhere to any particular funding"
university-of-dundee.md,"body’s requirements and any additional conditions or practices within the field. It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator to adhere to funder requirements for data publishing and, where necessary, to negotiate an extension to restrictions on placing data in the public domain."
university-of-dundee.md,"2.10. Where data are published, the Principal Investigator is required to select an appropriate license under which their data will be made available and to ensure that the license permits sharing and re-use in accordance with their funder’s mandate and the terms and conditions of this policy. Guidance is available from University support services (see item 1.10 above). Electronic data published by the University Repository will be catalogued using structured metadata which includes details of licensing and a robust persistent digital object identifier (DOI)."
university-of-dundee.md,"2.11. The University of Dundee retains the rights to re-use Research Data or make it openly available for others to re-use. Exclusive rights to re-use or publish Research Data should not therefore be granted to any third party, including commercial publishers, without prior discussion with RIS (paragraph 1.8 refers)."
university-of-dundee.md,"2.12. The University of Dundee retains the intellectual property rights of the Research Data. Principal Investigators are entitled to be the first publishers of the data they have generated and have the right to be identified and credited as the creator. Original copies of data must be retained. Duplicate copies of data may be taken with permission of the PI or Dean where the re-use of the data are acceptable, as defined by this policy."
university-of-dundee.md,2.13. All clinical trials sponsored by the University of Dundee must be registered on an appropriate publicly accessible research register within 6 weeks of first participant recruitment in the UK. Summary results data from clinical trials must be made publicly accessible in an appropriate format within 12 months from trial completion (for further details see the TASC Publication Policy).
university-of-dundee.md,## 3. Further assistance with application of policy
university-of-dundee.md,"Guidance on the central record of Research Data sets, open access, appropriate internal and external research data repositories, and research data management planning is available from the Assistant Director, Research & Resources, LLC (h.whaley@dundee.ac.uk). Guidance on IPR and collaboration agreements is available from RIS (research@dundee.ac.uk). Guidance on clinical or health data is available from TASC (tasctayside@nhs.net) and HIC (hicsupport@dundee.ac.uk)."
university-of-dundee.md,"If there is uncertainty around the applicability or interpretation of this policy, the matter must be referred to the Convener of the University’s Research Governance & Policy Sub-Committee (contact the Assistant Director (Research & Resources), LLC, in the first instance: h.whaley@dundee.ac.uk).

university-of-dundee.md,"For all confidential research data hosted outside University networks – on University licensed systems such as Microsoft Stream, OneDrive, SharePoint - electronic records should be protected with passwords and encrypted as outlined in UoD IT security and storage guidance. Further information is available at UoDIT guides."
university-of-dundee.md,### 4.3. Archiving data
university-of-dundee.md,"The requirement to archive data is triggered when research records become (relatively) inactive after the completion of a project, or phase of a project, or when a PI or PhD student leaves the University. At this stage the PI should arrange transfer to approved University storage facilities for longer term storage. It is essential that data are well described in order that they are easily identifiable and retrievable (PGMRD 2.1, 2.3). Data should be converted to open file formats where possible."
university-of-dundee.md,#### 4.3.1. Appraisal of data
university-of-dundee.md,"Data must be appraised in accordance with the Data Management Plan. The PI determines what data is to be retained and where it is to be stored – either publically in an external subject specific repository or the University institutional repository, Discovery or internally on University approved storage. All files must be named according to the conventions described in section 4.1 of this document and a descriptive title for the dataset created."
university-of-dundee.md,"Research data should be preserved for as long as it is of continuing value to the researcher, the wider research team/community and in line with known legal and regulatory obligations. As stated in the PGMRD 2.7, research sponsors may specify requirements for retention of specific categories of records."
university-of-dundee.md,"For an overview of funders policies see   Clarification of funder policy and support with compliance is provided by LLC Research Services, contact discovery@dundee.ac.uk."
university-of-dundee.md,The University of Dundee retention policy for research data is outlined in the Policy to Govern the Management of Research Data. Staff/students are permitted to take a copy of their research data where data are not sensitive and where permission has been obtained from
university-of-dundee.md,the PI.6 (PGMRD 2.12)
university-of-dundee.md,#### 4.3.2. Data that is to be destroyed
university-of-dundee.md,"Research data should be destroyed when judged to be of no further value or when retention periods described in the Data Management Plan expire. Destruction should be authorised by staff with appropriate authority, such as the PI or their designated administrator and should be carried out in accordance with the University’s Guidance on the proper disposal of information."
university-of-dundee.md,PIs who are leaving the institution and are transferring an ongoing project must notify the LLC and provide authorisation for destruction of the data at Dundee following completion of the transfer.
university-of-dundee.md,#### 4.3.3. Data catalogue – creating a record
university-of-dundee.md,At the point of archiving a record must be created in Discovery (instructions on creating a data record in Discovery) and the data given a descriptive title (PGRMD 2.5). Persistent identifiers (e.g. a digital object identifier - DOI) assigned to published data should be recorded in the data catalogue entry in Discovery. This record can either be made visible in the Discovery portal or set to confidential.
university-of-dundee.md,"Data made publically available from Discovery or the Image Data Repository, Omero, will have been assigned a DOI by the University. If a DOI is required contact discovery@dundee.ac.uk."
university-of-dundee.md,"The minimum metadata collected in the Discovery data catalogue record are Title, Creator, Publisher, Year, Resource Type and Rights (i.e. licencing restrictions on data reuse). Additional recommended elements include ORCiD, Description, Time period, Geo location, Associated publications, Associated datasets."
university-of-dundee.md,"For a DOI to be minted the minimum metadata required are Title, Creator, Publisher, Year, DOI and Resource type (e. g. image data) – additional metadata such as File type and size, Subject, Version, Rights, ORCiD, PMID, Funder, Associated publications, can also be captured. Further detail and guidance on the metadata that can be captured when registering a DOI can be found at this link."
university-of-dundee.md,## 5. Definitions
university-of-dundee.md,"Research data are the evidence that underpins the answer to the research question, and can be used to validate findings regardless of its form (e.g. print, digital, or physical). These might be quantitative information or qualitative statements collected by researchers in the course of their work by experimentation, observation, modelling, interview or other methods, or information derived from existing evidence. As defined by RCUK Concordat on Open Research Data. Research and experimental development (R&D) comprise creative work undertaken on a systematic basis in order to increase the stock of knowledge, including knowledge of man, culture and society, and the use of this stock of knowledge to devise new applications.

university-of-east-anglia.md,## Background
university-of-east-anglia.md,This Policy sets out the principles that guide the University in managing research data and demonstrating its continued commitment to excellence and integrity in research.
university-of-east-anglia.md,"Research Data Management affects everyone at UEA who is engaged in research, at whatever level and whatever their discipline.  ‘Data’ exist in a wide variety of forms across all UEA research fields and the principles laid out here are equally relevant to images of artefacts in art history, as computer models in game theory, as sequences in genetics and as spectra in structure characterisation.  From new students to experienced researchers, ensuring that research materials are well managed throughout the research project, and beyond, enables UEA’s research to have the greatest possible reach and benefit to the academic community and the wider public."
university-of-east-anglia.md,### Review
university-of-east-anglia.md,This Research Data Management Policy sets out the University’s position on the management of Research Data.  This is a rapidly-evolving area and the supporting document on Research Data
university-of-east-anglia.md,Management Procedures and Guidance will be updated as the resources and infrastructure to support Research Data management are developed throughout the University.
university-of-east-anglia.md,"This Policy will be reviewed and updated by the University Research Ethics Committee (UREC) and recommendations will be made to the University Research Executive, and thereafter to Senate before 31 December 2025."

university-of-east-anglia.md,### Introduction
university-of-east-anglia.md,"The University of East Anglia recognises Research Data as a valuable institutional asset to be managed in line with UKRI Common Principles on Research Data (  In addition, the University acknowledges the role that good Research Data management can play in supporting the University’s research vision to ensure that our research has the highest possible global influence through a dissemination strategy that maximises impact and that ensures effective communication of our research."
university-of-east-anglia.md,The purpose of this Policy is to ensure that Researchers and support staff:
university-of-east-anglia.md,are supported in good Research Data management practice.
university-of-east-anglia.md,find it easier to conduct research relying on Research Data.
university-of-east-anglia.md,benefit from improved citations of their work.
university-of-east-anglia.md,can maximise impact of their research by encouraging discoverability and re-use.
university-of-east-anglia.md,have a reduced likelihood of data loss through inaccessibility and corruption.
university-of-east-anglia.md,can comply with legislation and the policies and requirements of research funders and of Third Party Data providers.
university-of-east-anglia.md,are supported in protecting intellectual property and commercialisation opportunities.
university-of-east-anglia.md,## Scope
university-of-east-anglia.md,"The University’s Guidelines for Good Practice in Research1  outline what is expected of its Researchers. This policy and the associated guidance2 expand on this with respect to Research Data. As such, this policy applies to all UEA Researchers. It is the responsibility of heads of Faculties, Schools and Units to ensure their staff and students are aware of and comply with these policies."
university-of-east-anglia.md,### Definitions
university-of-east-anglia.md,"Research Data  There is no single definition of what constitutes Research Data. For the purposes of the University’s Research Data Management Policy and the associated Procedures and Guidelines, the following definition, from the Concordat on Open Research Data3, provides an indication of the scope: “Research data are the evidence that underpins the answer to the research question, and can be used to validate findings regardless of its form (e.g. print, digital, or physical). These might be quantitative information or qualitative statements collected by researchers in the course of their work by experimentation, observation, modelling, interview or other methods, or information derived from existing evidence. Data may be raw or primary (e.g. direct from measurement or collection) or derived from primary data for subsequent analysis or interpretation (e.g. cleaned up or as an extract from a larger data set), or derived from existing sources where the rights may be held by others. Data may be defined as ‘relational’ or ‘functional’ components of research, thus signalling that their identification and value lies in whether and how researchers use them as evidence for claims.”"
university-of-east-anglia.md,"A definition of the research data should be provided in the Data Management Plan.4 Examples of research data include (but are not limited to): documents, spreadsheets, databases, field notebooks, diaries, audio- and video recordings, photographs and images, transcripts, survey responses, protein or genetic sequences, algorithms, computer code, workflows, standard operating procedures and protocols. All data gathered and generated as a result of the research, and not just analysed data that underpin a research output, are in scope. The mechanisms for retention and archive will necessarily differ according to the format of the data, or due to disciplinary norms. Where data are obtained from a third party, any adjustments to that base data set on which research relies should be included within the data generated as a result of the research."
university-of-east-anglia.md,rchers The term Researchers is used to refer collectively to the following groups of people:
university-of-east-anglia.md,"Academic, research and relevant support staff employed by the University, and other individuals carrying out research at, or on behalf of, the University Students undertaking research (including undergraduate research projects) and their supervisors"
university-of-east-anglia.md,"Any persons with honorary positions conducting research within, or on behalf of, the University."
university-of-east-anglia.md,"In this document, the following verbal forms are used:"
university-of-east-anglia.md,“shall” and “must” indicated a requirement;
university-of-east-anglia.md,“should” indicates a recommendation;
university-of-east-anglia.md,“may” indicates a permission;
university-of-east-anglia.md,“can” indicates a possibility or a capability.
university-of-east-anglia.md,## Principles
university-of-east-anglia.md,The University’s policy is based on the following principles:
university-of-east-anglia.md,1. Publicly funded Research Data are a public good and should be made openly available wherever possible.
university-of-east-anglia.md,2. Research Data include both digital and non-digital forms and the definition of Research Data shall be guided by that widely accepted within the relevant discipline of the research.
university-of-east-anglia.md,"3. Overall responsibility for Research Data Management at UEA rests with Research Executive. Every project must have a named Researcher responsible for data management. Researchers who are students shall seek advice about management and preservation of their research data from their supervisor(s), course/module director. All Researchers have a responsibility to familiarise themselves with this policy and the associated guidance."
university-of-east-anglia.md,"4. UEA shall provide advice and support to Researchers in planning and managing their Research Data through the provision of training, guidance, good practice documentation and expert advice."
university-of-east-anglia.md,"5. Best practice for the management of Research Data starts at the earliest stage of planning a research project and should cover all stages of the Research Data lifecycle, normally through the creation of a Data Management Plan which should be updated as necessary over the course of the research project. This should cover the requirements of working across various locations where necessary."
university-of-east-anglia.md,6. Researchers shall include a short statement within a research output describing how and on what terms supporting Research Data can be accessed.
university-of-east-anglia.md,"7. Research Data that are made available shall be as comprehensive as possible and have clear instructions for use, including Metadata that facilitates discovery and reuse."
university-of-east-anglia.md,"8. Research Data should be kept and remain available for access for at least 10 years following any publication, except when special circumstances apply.  Metadata should be kept indefinitely. Any additional documents required to enable sharing or reuse, or to meet legal or ethical obligations should also be retained for as long as is necessary to ensure continuing access of Research Data. In the case of undergraduate research projects, this requirement may be waived, where student and supervisor(s) or course/module director agree that this is not appropriate for that research project. This decision should be documented."
university-of-east-anglia.md,"9. A Researcher should use an appropriate external repository or data centre which will archive and preserve Research Data, e.g. national, disciplinary or funder archive. Alternatively, if no such repository or data centre is available, Researchers should use a central repository provided by UEA.  Where the data are held externally, UEA will have a Metadata record for the data, including a link to the holding repository. There is no need to duplicate data in a central UEA repository if is held in another repository or archive."
university-of-east-anglia.md,"10. Where the transfer of Research Data between organisations is required, it should be straightforward (e.g. research collaborations, Researchers moving between HEIs) but also secure and managed (i.e. not on an exclusive basis unless that is a condition of funding), and accompanied by appropriate documentation (eg data sharing agreements).  Where the Research Data have an assessed commercial value then additional steps will need to be followed before Research Data can be transferred."
university-of-east-anglia.md,"11. Any destruction of Research Data shall be in accordance with the terms of this Policy, the retention period set out in the Data Management Plan and any legal and funder requirements, whichever is the most stringent."
university-of-east-anglia.md,"12. All Researchers must comply with any policies, mandates and expectations around Research Data that are imposed by the university, their funders, as well as any wider legal or ethical requirements, including (but not limited to) relevant Data Protection and Freedom of Information legislation."
university-of-east-anglia.md,"13. Researchers should recognise the Intellectual Property in all research outputs and processes, and manage it appropriately, in line with the University’s Intellectual Property Regulation."
university-of-east-anglia.md,14. The University’s Research Data policy and procedures will be reviewed and updated regularly.

Research data created by UEL staff and research postgraduates must be managed in compliance with UK Research and Innovation’s Common principles on data policy and other relevant community standards throughout the research data lifecycle as part of UEL’s commitment to academic excellence.
university-of-east-london.md,"2. Primary responsibility for compliance with this policy lies with Principle Investigators (PIs) or UEL lead investigators where the PI is not employed by UEL. For research postgraduates, primary responsibility lies with the student themselves."
university-of-east-london.md,3. Directors of Research will support and advocate for compliance with this policy. They will make arrangements for stewardship of datasets in the absence of PIs.
university-of-east-london.md,4. Library & Learning Services provide advice and guidance on best practice for managing research data and adhering to funder requirements and the requirements of this policy.
university-of-east-london.md,"5. Library & Learning Services, supported by IT Services, provide the systems and technical infrastructure required to support this policy. This comprises UEL’s research data repository (data.uel), as well as data backup and archiving. This infrastructure ensures the long term integrity of UEL’s research data and ensures that funder requirements for secure storage and sharing of data can be fully met."
university-of-east-london.md,## Data Management Plans
university-of-east-london.md,6. Any research that generates empirical or statistical datasets or any other type of digital object must have a data management plan (DMP). All externally-funded research must have a DMP if required by the funder. A DMP is strongly advised for all other research. The completion of a DMP is the responsibility of the PI.
university-of-east-london.md,7. Any research that requires approval from the University Research Ethics Committee must have a DMP. This is a mandatory condition of the ethics approval process.
university-of-east-london.md,8. Research postgraduates must create a DMP if their research will generate empirical or statistical datasets or any other type of digital object. DMPs are strongly advised for all research conducted by research postgraduates. Responsibility for this lies with the student.
university-of-east-london.md,"9. DMPs for funded research should adhere to the requirements of the funding body. Unless other guidelines from a funding body apply, DMPs should adhere to the guidelines in Annex A of UKRI’s Common principles on data policy. Library & Learning Services provide advice on DMP best practice."
university-of-east-london.md,10. Library & Learning Services and Research & Development Support (ReDS) must be provided with access to a copy of all DMPs.
university-of-east-london.md,## Management of ‘live’ research data
university-of-east-london.md,11. Anyone engaged in research at UEL must take all appropriate steps to ensure the security and integrity of research data as it is generated and worked upon. Instructions and requirements documented in the DMP must be adhered to at all times. Library & Learning Services and IT Services provide advice and guidance on management of live research data.
university-of-east-london.md,## Depositing research data
university-of-east-london.md,"12. Depositing data has important benefits for researchers, UEL, and the wider scholarly community. Deposited data is protected and safeguarded, ensuring it is available for future consultation or reuse."
university-of-east-london.md,13. All data must be deposited in a data repository where appropriate and the depositing arrangements specified in the DMP must be adhered to. Library & Learning Services provide further advice on whether it is appropriate for data to be deposited.
university-of-east-london.md,"14. Data should be deposited in UEL’s data repository (data.uel) unless an external repository has been specified by a research funder, or unless the PI or research postgraduate wishes to deposit in an alternative repository (e.g. a discipline-specific repository). Library & Learning Services must be informed of all datasets deposited somewhere other than data.uel so that a record linking to that dataset’s location can be created."
university-of-east-london.md,"15. Data should be deposited as soon as is practicable after the completion of the research and generally no later than the publishing of the results. Any timescales for upload imposed by external funders must be adhered to. It is recognised that time may be required to prepare data for deposit (e.g. to carry out anonymisation), but this must not unduly delay the deposit of the data, or its release where appropriate."
university-of-east-london.md,16. Researchers are responsible for preparing research data for depositing. Library & Learning Services provide advice about preparation.
university-of-east-london.md,"17. Where UEL is not the lead institution, it is expected that the lead institution will take responsibility for depositing the data in an appropriate repository. UEL will not add a duplicate of the dataset to data.uel, but will create a record linking to the dataset’s location."
university-of-east-london.md,"18. A Digital Object Identifier (DOI) will be assigned to datasets stored on data.uel to enable effective citation, discovery, and access. Data will be linked to relevant outputs in UEL’s open access publications repository, ROAR."
university-of-east-london.md,"19. There is a presumption of releasing data created at UEL, with appropriate safeguards, in order to meet regulatory and contractual requirements. All data should be fully released, with appropriate safeguards, including secure dissemination, unless there are specific reasons to prevent this."
university-of-east-london.md,"20. Personal or sensitive data must be anonymised where it is appropriate for release in other respects. It is recognised that there will always be some data too sensitive for general release, even with anonymisation. The UEL Data Protection Officer provides advice and guidance on what is inappropriate for general release."
university-of-east-london.md,"21. In all cases, the legitimate interests, rights, and freedoms of participants must be protected in line with data protection legislation and research ethics approval."
university-of-east-london.md,"22. Library & Learning Services supports researchers in creating appropriate and high quality metadata, which will enable other researchers to understand the research and the re-use potential of the data. Where data cannot be made available openly, the metadata should state the reasons why."
university-of-east-london.md,"23. Data must be appraised (reviewed) at the end of the research project and every 5 years thereafter, unless another timescale is specified by the research funder, until the data are transferred or destroyed. PIs are responsible for ensuring this is carried out and for taking any decisions about whether data should be transferred or destroyed. If the PI has left UEL, this responsibility will fall to the relevant Director of Research. Advice may be sought from Research and Development Support (ReDS), Library & Learning Services, and UEL’s Data Protection Officer. In any cases where there is disagreement over whether data should be destroyed, the Pro-Vice Chancellor (Impact & Innovation) will take the final decision."
university-of-east-london.md,24. Library & Learning Services will assist PIs in transferring data to external services where appropriate and record any transfers and destruction of datasets.
university-of-east-london.md,"25. Exclusive rights to reuse or publish research data should not be handed over to commercial publishers without retaining the rights to make the data openly available, unless this is a condition of funding."
university-of-east-london.md,26. Library & Learning Services will provide reporting on this policy and its implementation to the Research & Knowledge Exchange Committee and other bodies as appropriate.
university-of-east-london.md,"27. All UEL-led research, regardless of format, duration, funding, or collaboration must adhere to all relevant UEL policies. Failure to do so may result in the removal of ethics approval, support, or the premature closure of a project."

university-of-essex.md,### Purpose
university-of-essex.md,"This policy sets out how research data at the University of Essex is managed throughout the data lifecycle so as to ensure transparency and appropriate access, supporting research funders, including UK Research and Innovation’s expectation to make research data arising from its funding as open as possible and as restricted as necessary. (See: Making your research data open – UKRI)"
university-of-essex.md,### Scope
university-of-essex.md,"This policy encompasses all data from research that has the potential for publication, regardless of whether or not the research is funded. It applies to doctoral and postdoctoral research and may apply to undergraduate and masters level research."
university-of-essex.md,# Research Data Management Policy
university-of-essex.md,### Research Integrity
university-of-essex.md,1. Research data must be managed to the highest standards throughout the research data lifecycle as part of the University’s mission for  research excellence and commitment to Research Integrity.
university-of-essex.md,2. The interests of human participants in research must be protected during all stages of the data lifecycle (See University of Essex Guidelines for Ethical Approval of Research Involving Human Participants) (.pdf).
university-of-essex.md,### Responsibilities
university-of-essex.md,3. Responsibility for managing data for any research project or programme lies with Principal Investigators or with individual researchers (academic staff or students) working on their own. All staff and students must follow the IT Acceptable Use Policy and our Information Security Policy (.pdf).
university-of-essex.md,"4. The University is responsible for raising awareness of good practice and obligations with respect to research data, and for the provision of useful platforms, guidance, and services in support of current and future access, during and after completion of research projects."
university-of-essex.md,### Storage
university-of-essex.md,"5. Research data must be offered and assessed for deposit and retention in an appropriate national or international data service or subject repository, or the University research data repository."
university-of-essex.md,"6. University will, wherever practicable, provide mechanisms and services for secure storage, backup, registration (including ensuring that data has sufficient metadata and can be assigned a Digital Object Identifier (doi), deposit and retention of research data assets in support of current and future access, during and after completion of research projects."
university-of-essex.md,"7. Any data which is created as part of research at the University, but which is retained elsewhere, for example in an international data service or subject repository, should be registered with the University through the University research data repository."
university-of-essex.md,### Security Sensitive Material
university-of-essex.md,"8. Researchers, both staff and students (postgraduate and undergraduate), using security-sensitive material should be aware of and comply with the University’s Security-sensitive Research Material Policy and Procedures.  The University has separate secure storage for such material and a registration process."
university-of-essex.md,### Data Management Plans
university-of-essex.md,"9. The Principal Investigators for each research project or programme are responsible for the creation and ownership of an appropriate research data management plan, aligned with the FAIR principles, and for ensuring that all members of the research team are aware of, understand and abide by the plan. When the project or programme involves collaboration with any external partner, there should be an agreement regarding the rights and responsibilities of each party with respect to data collected, including key decisions about data storage, backup and security, registration, access, transfer, retention, destruction or archiving and licensing."
university-of-essex.md,"10. All research proposals must include research data management plans that explicitly address data types, formats and volume, capture, storage, management, documentation and metadata, integrity, confidentiality, retention and destruction, sharing and publication.  A suggested minimum period of retention is three years from the end of the project, however requirements by funders and data providers, as well as disciplinary guidance should be observed, as this it may be substantially greater. Data should be made available in perpetuity wherever possible."
university-of-essex.md,"11. The University will provide training, support, advice and where appropriate guidelines and templates for research data management and research data management plans. Further information is available on data management plans and data protection and research activity."
university-of-essex.md,### Access and sharing
university-of-essex.md,"12. Research data management plans must ensure that research data are available for access and reuse where legally, ethically and commercially appropriate, taking note of any relevant safeguards and with reference to the University Open Research Position Statement (.pdf). Data release will be timely, as appropriate to the nature of the research and the discipline.  Published research outputs should include a short statement describing how, and on what terms, any supporting research data may be accessed."
university-of-essex.md,"13. In determining access rights for research data, the rights and freedoms of the subjects of research data must be safeguarded, in line with the University’s and the researchers’ obligations in law and with any provisions of the data management plan. The rights of citizen scientists and the public to access publicly funded research should also be considered. When open access to datasets is not legal or ethical, information governance restrictions on access and use must be applied as necessary."
university-of-essex.md,"14. Written agreements are required when personal data (any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person) is passed from a data controller to a data processor or another data controller, or to a country not bound by the General Data Protection Regulation or equivalent privacy legislation. Written agreements are also useful when the data being shared although not personal data, are confidential or valuable to the parties involved.  The University’s Research and Enterprise Office can assist with providing templates for both incoming and outgoing research data and the drafting and negotiation of the agreements concerned. Exclusive rights to reuse or publish research data should not be transferred to commercial publishers or agents without retaining the nonexclusive rights to make the data openly available for re-use unless this is a condition of funding."
university-of-essex.md,### Policy ownership and review
university-of-essex.md,15. The Research Committee and the DITS Cyber Security Programme Board is responsible for reviewing and updating this policy on behalf of Senate.

university-of-greenwich.md,# University of Greenwich Statement on Scholarly Communication
university-of-greenwich.md,"The University of Greenwich is committed to expanding the total proportion of our research and scholarship outputs, and their underlying research data, that are published in open access (OA) forms."
university-of-greenwich.md,"The university is committed to enabling its active researchers to share the results of research through a range of open means in order to maximize research impact within the academic research community and across society more broadly. The university also supports the use of research identifiers for all researchers, such as ORCID; it is currently mandatory for anyone on a research career pathway to obtain and use their ORCID."
university-of-greenwich.md,"This statement and the policies that follow support the activities of many key research funders that now make the OA publication of outputs and data a condition of funding. This includes Research England, which requires articles and conference papers accepted for publication to be available in an appropriate open access format in order to be eligible for the Research Excellence Framework (REF)."
university-of-greenwich.md,The following policies apply to all staff and any postgraduate students actively engaged in research activity:
university-of-greenwich.md,## Publications Policy
university-of-greenwich.md,"There are two main routes to OA for publications, known as Gold and Green. The university holds a general preference to follow the Green route for publications by depositing appropriate copies into a recognised OA repository. Consequently, all staff and postgraduate students must make a record in the University of Greenwich Academic Literature Archive (GALA) for all published research outputs. For articles and conference proceedings (with an ISSN), an accepted manuscript must be uploaded to GALA within three months of acceptance, and the embargo period must not exceed a 12 month maxima (Panels A & B) or a 24 month maxima (Panels C & D1.)"
university-of-greenwich.md,"Where researchers use the Gold route to OA, whether in a gratis OA journal, through the university’s participation in a Transformative Agreement with a publisher, or supported by project funds, a record of the output must still be added to GALA."
university-of-greenwich.md,"Where an author is licensing their research outputs and publications under an open or Creative Commons licence, the university takes a scholar-led approach. As such, the licensing decision is the responsibility of the individual researcher, unless they are in an agreement with a research funder or other associated external organisation that frequently mandate the use of specific open licences."
university-of-greenwich.md,"In order to optimise the potential impact of research outputs, this policy strongly recommends the most open licence available in order to help maximise impact potential and allow the university to actively contribute to the construction of the scholarly commons. Where institutional funds are involved in the access to an opportunity to openly license an output, such as through participation in a Transformative Agreement, open licensing opportunities should be agreed with Research Development Services."
university-of-greenwich.md,"In support of this policy, the university commits to support and train academic and research staff in understanding OA and the Research England policy for REF, as well as choosing journals and licences that allow outputs to be compliant with institutional external policies and mandates."
university-of-greenwich.md,"The university also commits to maintaining GALA, optimising it for emerging publication types and supporting its ongoing use with training and online materials."
university-of-greenwich.md,"GALA forms an institutional record of the research and scholarship published by the university's research community, helping to protect and preserve the scholarly record. Records are anticipated to be kept permanently, but where appropriate, the Takedown Policy exists to fairly handle the removal of any records as required."
university-of-greenwich.md,## Research Data Policy
university-of-greenwich.md,The university takes the definition of research data as:
university-of-greenwich.md,"“evidence that underpins the answer to the research question, and can be used to validate findings regardless of its form (e.g. print, digital, or physical) … [including] statistics, collections of digital images, sound recordings, transcripts of interviews, survey data and fieldwork observations with appropriate annotations, an interpretation, an artwork, archives, found objects, published texts or a manuscript” (The Concordat Working Group, 2016)."
university-of-greenwich.md,"Making research data accessible for reuse and to increase its potential impact is a key objective for UK Research Councils, and they have played a leading role in the development of the Concordat on Open Research Data on which this policy document is based.  Other funding agencies such as UK Government Departments, EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation and various charitable foundations have developed policies to encourage more open access to research data.  In addition, journal publishers are advocating that access to the underlying data should be an intrinsic part of the academic publishing process."
university-of-greenwich.md,"In accordance with the principles laid out in the Concordat on Open Research Data, all appropriate data generated by projects supported or led by University of Greenwich staff, as appropriate, shall be made openly available with as few restrictions as possible. When legally, commercially and ethically appropriate, data will be uploaded to an appropriate funder repository2 in a timely and responsible manner. If an appropriate data repository cannot be found, datasets must be uploaded to GALA."
university-of-greenwich.md,"Data should be retained for a minimum of 10 years from the end of the project, or from publication of an output relating to the research, whichever comes first. Where funder or other legal requirements specify a longer retention period, this should be observed."
university-of-greenwich.md,Research data that must be retained after project completion include:
university-of-greenwich.md,"a. Data that support research findings3,"
university-of-greenwich.md,"b. Data that are of potential long-term value,"
university-of-greenwich.md,c. Data that support patent applications
university-of-greenwich.md,d. Data which are subject to other legal requirements for data retention.
university-of-greenwich.md,"Researchers should avoid retaining data solely using methods that might not persist for 10 years, such as on project websites, personal computing equipment or in formats limited to proprietary software. Researchers are permitted to have an embargo period on their research data to complete their work, publications, or intellectual property filing on that data, before release."
university-of-greenwich.md,"Datasets hosted in funder or subject repositories must still be registered with the university, either during the closure of a project, or by contacting researchsupport@gre.ac.uk."
university-of-greenwich.md,"All research proposals must include a data management plan, regardless of whether it is required by the funder. Researchers should also ensure that research proposals include a budget, where applicable, to cover the costs of managing research data in both the short and longer term."
university-of-greenwich.md,"All data handlers and processors have responsibilities for the data collected, created, stored, and/or preserved. However, the Principal Investigator (PI) may have overall responsibility for the implementation of data management plans of a research project, in order to ensure that research data are available for access and re-use where appropriate and with the necessary safeguards. All of this must be undertaken in line with the university’s relevant policies4."
university-of-greenwich.md,"The university recognises its responsibility to ensure researchers are supported throughout the research process to ensure full compliance with funder data policies and contractual requirements on research data management. The university commits to support academic and research staff in choosing a repository as well as writing data management plans, selecting and appraising data for storage, and in understanding and meeting any other requirements."

university-of-groningen.md,## 1.  Introduction
university-of-groningen.md,"The social standing of academic inquiry and of universities in general will only be maintained and enhanced if all research is done in an appropriate and ethical manner, including protecting the confidentiality of personal information, while at the same time enabling peer review and verification of data."
university-of-groningen.md,"To protect people during research, especially vulnerable people, means supporting good practices that deal with data management and ethical aspects."
university-of-groningen.md,"This document outlines the general policy relating to Research Data Management (RDM) in the Faculty of Spatial Sciences, and it lays out what is expected of staff and PhD students based in the Faculty. The document links to and needs to be read alongside other documents such as the policies on research ethics. For the learning environment of bachelor and master students a ‘light’ version of this data management policy is applicable, while learning skills on data management is part of the educational programme."
university-of-groningen.md,"This document is updated regularly and aligned with the central RUG research portal (  and follows a range of procedures and protocols that have been implemented at European, Dutch and University levels. Of particular note is the legal requirement of the university to comply with the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It is therefore important that staff and PhD researchers are aware of and comply with this policy and the requirements and general expectations it discusses."
university-of-groningen.md,"The Faculty’s overall position is one that accepts that its academic staff and PhDs are professional and competent, but acknowledges that it is the Faculty’s legal and social responsibility to provide appropriate oversight and monitoring in an efficient way."
university-of-groningen.md,## 2.  Governance and standing of this document
university-of-groningen.md,"This revised research data management (RDM) policy document was developed in response to the UG Research Data Policy 2021, and is consistent with university trends around the world. This document will be revised from time to time and is subject to changes in the various regulations that underpin it. It also needs to be read alongside the following documents:"
university-of-groningen.md,the Faculty’s policy and procedures on Research Ethics the Faculty’s URSI Research Data Repository: Storage Protocol
university-of-groningen.md,"Furthermore, the following documents provide extra context:"

university-of-groningen.md,## 3.  Scope
university-of-groningen.md,"The subject matter of this policy is the proper management of all data processed in research activities at the Faculty of Spatial Sciences and research data processed in collaboration with national and international research partners. Specifically relevant here are ‘Personal data’.  Personal data is any information that relates to an individual who can be directly or indirectly identified. Names and email addresses are obviously personal data. Location information, ethnicity, gender, biometric data, religious beliefs, web cookies, and political opinions can also be personal data. Pseudonymous data can also fall under the definition if it’s relatively easy to ID someone from it."
university-of-groningen.md,‘Data’ should also be taken as ‘digitized data’. Data that exist in paper format (e.g. questionnaires) fall within the scope of this plan only to the extent to which they can be digitized.
university-of-groningen.md,## 4.  Rights and responsibilities relating to this policy
university-of-groningen.md,"This policy document and the procedures in it apply to all staff involved in research and all PhD students in the Faculty. For students the Data Protection Guide for Student Research has been developed in the context of the learning environment, when writing a bachelor or master thesis or an article. This is described in section 11."
university-of-groningen.md,"Researchers are regarded as being responsible in their own right for compliance with these requirements and are expected to follow the current procedure of ethics approval, overseen by their supervisors. Apart from familiarity with the expectations of research data management in general, for each specific research project or PhD project, the following requirements apply."
university-of-groningen.md,"1. Shortly after commencement of a research project, the principal investigator (for a funded project to a staff member) or PhD student (for a PhD project) needs to complete a Research Data Management Plan using the online tool available (click on this link) in anticipation of other tools  which might be implemented in the context of the RUG wide Research gateway. This must be done for all projects irrespective of their data requirements. In situations where there is no use of data, the RDMP Tool is very easily completed, but must be done to ensure that the Faculty is exercising its oversight responsibility. Should there be a significant change to data or methodology over the course of a project, it is the researcher’s obligation to provide an update to the RDM Plan and to revise what is stored on the RDMP Tool. Researchers will be expected to adhere to the plan (as updated from time to time) and that they and the Plan comply with the expectations described in this document."
university-of-groningen.md,"2. Near completion of the research project, the principal investigator or PhD student will need to archive all data in an appropriate digital and anonymised form in the Faculty Research Data Repository. This is currently the Y-drive on the University’s network until a RUG wide repository has been installed. The researcher’s data should also be accessible by the supervisor, at least when the PhD project has ended."
university-of-groningen.md,"3. Repositories such as Dataverse are also allowed, e.g. in case of EU-funded projects:"
university-of-groningen.md,## 5.  Overarching principles
university-of-groningen.md,This policy is informed by several key overarching principles that govern research at the University of Groningen and at universities in general:
university-of-groningen.md,"All research is to be undertaken in an ethical and legally responsible manner, paying due respect to all participants in the research process, and in accordance with relevant legislation. Although there are many aspects to ethical research, the concept of informed consent is fundamental. Essentially, all research participants should be fully informed about all aspects of the research, including plans for the storage of data, and their informed consent has been obtained before their data is collected. With regard to research ethics policies and standard academic integrity we refer here to the RUG policy which is based on the Netherlands Code of Conduct for Research Integrity 2018."
university-of-groningen.md,"Research also applies to student research, carried out in the context of a bachelor or master thesis or the writing of an article. Learning skills on data management is part of the educational programme. This is elaborated upon in section 11."
university-of-groningen.md,"When personal data are processed in research, then these must be handled in a way that meets the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). In particular, this entails the requirement to demonstrate that appropriate"
university-of-groningen.md,"technical and organizational measures to achieve privacy by design are in place. When possible, data needs to be anonymised."
university-of-groningen.md,"Research methodologies, experimental design, data, data analysis, statistics, results and interpretations should be subject to peer review and scrutiny, and all researchers should be able to substantiate their choices, and be able to provide access for validation of the integrity of the data."
university-of-groningen.md,"Where research is publicly funded, the results of the research should be made publicly accessible, either through the provision of open access publications or by making short summaries available."
university-of-groningen.md,"Where feasible and ethically appropriate, researchers will make their data FAIR (see section 12)."
university-of-groningen.md,## 6.  Research data management throughout the whole research process
university-of-groningen.md,### (1) Planning research and data needs
university-of-groningen.md,"In planning research and the methodology to be used, it is important to consider the ethical as well as practical implications of how the research is to be conducted and data collected and managed, especially the requirement to anonymise the data as soon as practical. Awareness of the requirements should influence the design of the methodology. The planning of the research must include the need to consider ethical issues and the requirements relating to data management. The resulting research data management plan should be registered via this link."
university-of-groningen.md,### (2) Data collection
university-of-groningen.md,"Data is to be collected in an ethically responsible way. During the data collection process, there needs to be security of data already collected. For example, questionnaires should be securely stored. Audio or video recordings should be transferred to a password protected device as soon as possible. Initially data is likely to be re-identifiable, with the identification kept separate to actual data; however, it should be anonymised as soon as practical. Ideally, data is stored directly onto the Y: drive."
university-of-groningen.md,"During field work, data can be stored initially on a personal computer or laptop if there is no internet possibility. The data will need to be uploaded onto the Y-drive regularly (depending on the circumstances). It is recommended to also upload on an encrypted external hard-drive and then delete data from the laptop. It is also good practice to encrypt the partition of the harddrive reserved for storing personal data. In case of loss or stolen laptop/devices this needs to be reported as a data breach via cert@security.rug.nl."
university-of-groningen.md,### (3) Access to data during the research process
university-of-groningen.md,"Except for legitimate requests relating to scientific integrity concerns, it is generally advisable to restrict access to data to the researcher and supervisor(s) only, and restrict access until such time that the researcher is completely sure that original research data have been verified (for coding accuracy) and maybe until all publications being produced from the data are finalised. However, all research participants have a right to see any data that pertains directly to them, and can request that data which refer to the research participant will be removed from the data set where this is feasible."
university-of-groningen.md,### (4) Storage of data
university-of-groningen.md,"In line with the Netherlands Code of Conduct for Scientific Practice and the policies of the University of Groningen, empirical data is required to be stored safely. In anticipation of a RUG wide repository, the Faculty manages a Research Data Repository (Y-drive). The FSS repository is in a digital form where every researcher has their own folder identified with a P-number. Researchers will be required to provide their data in an appropriate form (including anonymization). The function of the Faculty repository is to enable access only under certain specific circumstances relating to the need to be able to verify the data. The URSI Director in consultation with the researcher will be responsible for assessing any request to access data in the repository. Consistent with the prevailing requirements, data will be stored in this repository for a fixed period of 10 years. After 10 years, data that has not been made open access will be destroyed, though if needed data can be stored longer. Note that all data must be fully anonymised as soon as practical to do so."
university-of-groningen.md,"Note that the Faculty data repository is not an open access facility, it is merely established to allow scrutiny in relation to legitimate concerns about scientific integrity. To comply with the open access expectation, researchers might need to identify an appropriate open access data provider, such as might be provided by a scientific institute or a journal publisher."
university-of-groningen.md,### (5) Cybersecurity
university-of-groningen.md,A cyber security incident is a situation involving a breach of the security of the UG’s information systems and the data stored within them. A data breach is a situation in which the security of personal data has been compromised.
university-of-groningen.md,Examples of a cyber-security incidents and data breaches are:
university-of-groningen.md,A laptop gets stolen or is lost.
university-of-groningen.md,A data set containing personal information has been accidentally shared with a number of people who should not have access.
university-of-groningen.md,A couple of signed consent forms have been left in public transport.
university-of-groningen.md,Always report cyber security incidents (whether these are confirmed or suspected) and data breaches to the Computer Emergency Response Team via cert@security.rug.nl. This contact desk is also available for reporting incidents that require confidentiality.
university-of-groningen.md,## 7.  Responsibility for data management
university-of-groningen.md,"‘Ownership’ is a word with legal implications, and strictly speaking the ownership status of data is complicated by the employment status of the researcher as well as of any grant funding received. Nevertheless, irrespective of the formal ownership of data, all researchers have a responsibility for care of data; and the University of Groningen has a responsibility relating to any research done under its auspices. Therefore, unless there is a specific agreement to the contrary, responsibility for data management relating to the data from a specific research project will be regarded as the responsibility of the principal investigator or  PhD team (PhD student and supervisors), indicated in the RDM Plan submitted for that project."
university-of-groningen.md,"Responsibility for data in cases when the researcher leaves the University In the case of a PhD researcher finishing their PhD or a staff member leaving to go to another institution, for all completed projects, it is expected that all (anonymised) data will be deposited in the Faculty Research Data Repository in an appropriate form, accessible by the researcher and supervisor(s). For ongoing projects that are to remain at the University of Groningen, an alternative principle investigator is to be nominated."
university-of-groningen.md,"Responsibility for data when a researcher joins the University transferring a project In the case of a finished project, it will normally be expected that the previous institution will manage the data storage provisions into the future. In cases where a staff member transfers a project, the Faculty will accept responsibility for the project and future data storage responsibility."
university-of-groningen.md,Ownership and responsibility of data when cooperating with other
university-of-groningen.md,organizations/institutions
university-of-groningen.md,"This will be decided on a case by case basis, but for each project there must be a clear determination about which institution will be responsible for management of data and compliance with the requirements of the European General Data Protection"
university-of-groningen.md,Regulation.
university-of-groningen.md,## 8. Using personal data
university-of-groningen.md,In some cases researchers process personal data in their research. Researchers are therefore expected to understand the basic principles of the General Data Protection Regulation.
university-of-groningen.md,### (1) The General Data Protection Regulation
university-of-groningen.md,"Since May 2018, all member states of the European Economic Area share the same data protection law: the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This law governs the processing of personal data both inside and outside the EU/EEA when this is done by organisations based in one of the member states. This law also applies to research activities by universities, even when these take place in non-member states."
university-of-groningen.md,"Personal data in the GDPR are defined as “any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person” (Art. 4.1).  A ‘natural’ person means a living person. In the GDPR, there is no distinction between public and private/confidential data, only between personal and non-personal data. All personal data should be treated as confidential."
university-of-groningen.md,"In case of secondary data, the researcher should check if consent is needed from the secondary data source. Also when using existing data, it is important that the respondent gave consent for these data to be re-used. (see"
university-of-groningen.md,"Examples of ‘identifiers’ are names, an identification number, contact details, location data, dates and times of meetings, IP-addresses, ethnicity, religious identity, or a combination of data that allows for a person to be identified as a unique individual. ‘Processing’ should be understood as any operation with data: gathering, viewing, analyzing, storing, sharing etc."
university-of-groningen.md,The GDPR sets constraints to what is possible with personal data and requires us to properly secure the data.
university-of-groningen.md,We expect staff:
university-of-groningen.md,"to take notice of the general principles of the GDPR. A special UG website has been created to inform everyone in the UG about the basic principles; to take standard precautions when handling data. Among these are e.g. creating strong passwords, anonymisation when possible, working on secure devices and working on the university’s network as much as possible. See the UG’s website for a general overview of the standard measures that you can take; in case of handling personal data in research to be demonstrably compliant, by creating and registering a data management plan and applying for approval of the Research Ethics Committee and by checking whether a DPIA is necessary."
university-of-groningen.md,### (2) Demonstrating compliance
university-of-groningen.md,"A central principle in the GDPR is ‘accountability’. If researchers are planning to process personal data in their research, then they need to be able to demonstrate compliance with the GDPR. This means that researchers are expected to design their research in such a way that the private lives of participants as well as their rights and freedoms are minimally impacted, and that researchers can show how this will be achieved."
university-of-groningen.md,"Researchers are therefore expected to anonymise data when possible, design their research in a privacy-friendly way, think about appropriate technical and organizational measures, register their research proposal and follow the existing ethics approval procedure."
university-of-groningen.md,### (3) Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)
university-of-groningen.md,"Apart from a research data management plan, research involving living human beings may also require doing a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)."
university-of-groningen.md,A full DPIA report:
university-of-groningen.md,maps the data privacy risks in the project;
university-of-groningen.md,assesses these risks; and
university-of-groningen.md,defines protection measures to eliminate or mitigate the risks.
university-of-groningen.md,Performing a DPIA is legally required when data processing activities1 are likely to ‘result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons’ (art. 35 GDPR).
university-of-groningen.md,"An exhaustive list of potential high-risk scenario’s cannot be given in advance, but in general, a DPIA may be necessary when researchers are planning to include sensitive personal data into their dataset (such as health data or ethnicity); when they involve innovative technologies (and companies) that process data; research with location data, GPS tracking of individuals or research that uses ‘profiling techniques’; when people may be in a vulnerable position (children, or people  who face imbalances in power relationships; or when they systematic monitor of publicly accessible areas without informing people (‘covert observation’). Projects that involve many different partners with different (non-academic) aims  may also be subjected to a DPIA."
university-of-groningen.md,"If a DPIA is required, then this should take place before data processing starts. A DPIA can be supported by the Digital Competence Center and performed by a team of people involved in the project in question, including, for example, a subject expert, a privacy officer, an IT expert, and a student or staff member involved. The process may be timeconsuming. Researchers are therefore advised to contact the DCC as soon as possible (see section 20 on support)."
university-of-groningen.md,"If a DPIA has already been performed on a similar research project at our, or at a different research university in the EU/EEA zone, then this can also be used as a point of reference, provided that the data protection measures set out are demonstrably applied by the researcher."
university-of-groningen.md,The Privacy and Security Coordinator can advise whether a DPIA is necessary. The decision to do a DPIA is ultimately the responsibility of the Faculty Board.
university-of-groningen.md,## 9.  Role of the Graduate School in research data management
university-of-groningen.md,Some specific roles and responsibilities rest with the Graduate School. The Graduate School embeds the topic of data management in training activities for PhD researchers. Responsible data-management is an integrated part of scientific practice and is addressed in TSP plans and R&O conversations. GDPR is also part of the educational training for PhD candidates.
university-of-groningen.md,1. The RUG Graduate Schools provide mandatory training (e.g. on academic integrity) to Research Master’s students and PhD students.
university-of-groningen.md,"2. The Graduate Schools will oversee that PhD supervisors make arrangements with PhD students regarding data management and the recording of such arrangements in these students’ Training and Supervision Plans (TSP). In the TSP PhD thesis supervisors make arrangements, together with the PhD student, regarding the PhD student’s research data both during the project and (to be made available for further research) after the PhD project has concluded (Regulations of the conferral of a doctorate (PhD regulations) Art. 4.1.5.)."
university-of-groningen.md,3. The Graduate Schools will oversee that PhD candidates  complete an RDMP using the RDMP Tool.
university-of-groningen.md,4. The Graduate Schools will ensure – with support from the UG DCC – that best practices in the field of data management education are shared.
university-of-groningen.md,"## 10.  Education, data management and student research"
university-of-groningen.md,"The main focus of this data management plan is on research activities performed by (temporary) staff and PhD students. Training is offered by UG to staff and PhD candidates to develop skills in data management. Students may also work with personal data and they may publish their findings as well. Their research activities therefore fall under the responsibility of the Faculty if the research activities are part of compulsory course units under supervision of a staff member, i.e. a bachelor and master thesis or a publishable journal article.  As data management is a learning process like others, making mistakes is part of this process. Teaching students how to learn and improve skills on data management is part of the educational programme (for example in the course Methods of Academic Research)."
university-of-groningen.md,"In terms of data management/GDPR/ethics, actions are restricted to the following educational activities, and only in case:"
university-of-groningen.md,students are collecting primary data (personal data) themselves for compulsory course units of the degree programmes for the Bachelor’s and /or Master’s thesis.
university-of-groningen.md,"the results of research are published, not only in journals but also for example in conference papers."
university-of-groningen.md,These actions are:
university-of-groningen.md,Students make a data management plan as part of the Bachelor’s or Master’s Thesis process if it includes personal data (for example retrieved via interviews). This also includes a dedicated paragraph in the written thesis.
university-of-groningen.md,"The student should follow instructions to handle data in a correct way (checked by the supervisor), storing the data in a secure place, protected by  two-factor authentication, adhering to good practice."
university-of-groningen.md,"The Faculty and the CIT are responsible for offering the student a secure storage space. This will be the Y-drive by default, unless the project requires otherwise (to be determined case by case)."
university-of-groningen.md,Students and/or their supervisor should register the project in a suitable format once the RUG Research Gateway is in place.
university-of-groningen.md,The thesis supervisor(s) are responsible for guidance concerning good data management. The Faculty Board is responsible for creating guidelines concerning data management of research performed by students.
university-of-groningen.md,"## 11.  Implementing open science, FAIR principles, and open access to data"
university-of-groningen.md,"One of the University’s policy goals is to make, in principle, all data FAIR. Below, the general requirements that the data (and software and scripts) must meet at the UG are integrated into the presently accepted terminology of the FAIR principles. The data are:"
university-of-groningen.md,### Findable:
university-of-groningen.md,Data is sustainably stored and curated;
university-of-groningen.md,"Data is provided with metadata, including affiliation and, if possible, with a persistent identifier;"
university-of-groningen.md,Data is registered on the basis of metadata in the research database of the university.
university-of-groningen.md,### Accessible:
university-of-groningen.md,"Data is accurate, complete, reliable, authentic and provided with metadata and, if possible, with a persistent identifier;"
university-of-groningen.md,Data is available for checking and further research after completion of the research and/or the departure of the researcher;
university-of-groningen.md,"Data is openly available, unless valid reasons prevent this."
university-of-groningen.md,Interoperable:
university-of-groningen.md,Data is stored in sustainable file formats;
university-of-groningen.md,The discipline specific standards for the enrichment of data are applied;
university-of-groningen.md,Data (and metadata) is provided with references to other relevant material.
university-of-groningen.md,### Reusable:
university-of-groningen.md,The origin of the data and the affiliation of the researcher involved is clear (Provenance);
university-of-groningen.md,The discipline specific standards for data management are applied; The conditions for reuse are clearly described.
university-of-groningen.md,"Furthermore, open science and FAIR principles need to be integrated in the data process as much as possible. This policy is based on a “comply or explain” principle, meaning that exceptions to this policy are possible. A researcher may wish not to make the data publicly available when:"
university-of-groningen.md,1) Making the data publicly available would contradict any agreement or undertaken given as part of the informed consent process.
university-of-groningen.md,2) Where public release might have negative consequences for the people researched.
university-of-groningen.md,3) When there is an obligation or objective to protect results so that they can commercially or industrially exploited (or reasonably expected to be exploited).
university-of-groningen.md,4) Where public release could represent a security concern.
university-of-groningen.md,5) If open access would jeopardize achievement of the main aim of the research.
university-of-groningen.md,6) If there is any other legitimate reason not to publish the data.
university-of-groningen.md,"If any of these reasons is to be claimed, the researcher can indicate this in the datamanagement plan."
university-of-groningen.md,## 12.  Awareness-raising about data management
university-of-groningen.md,"The Faculty will take appropriate steps to inform staff and PhD students about the policy and expected procedures. Specifically, from January 2018 on, all new PhD candidates will be required to complete training covering research ethics and research data management issues. Furthermore, a special section in the PhD Training & Supervision Plan shall be dedicated to data management. The Faculty will take care that procedures of dealing with data are properly embedded in the educational programmes."
university-of-groningen.md,### Sharing Good Practices
university-of-groningen.md,The URSI Faculty Research Institute will emphasize sharing good practices amongst their researchers and PhD students. This will be done by means of:
university-of-groningen.md,"1. Organizing URSI (lunch) seminars with RDM as a central theme, thereby inviting and encouraging URSI staff and PhD students to attend."
university-of-groningen.md,"2. Inter-faculty platforms that stimulate the exchange of knowledge and best practices on RDM. These platforms are, amongst others, the privacy- and security officer meetings and the faculty funding officers meetings."
university-of-groningen.md,3. Attending national platforms for ethical committees.
university-of-groningen.md,"4. Formulating requirements on data management for BSc and MSc theses, to make this part of students' learning paths."
university-of-groningen.md,### Training
university-of-groningen.md,Awareness-raising about research data management is also realized by organizing workshops and training for our researchers and PhD students. These workshops have the aim to educate our researchers and PhD students in conducting responsible research.
university-of-groningen.md,"For PhD students the workshop Academic Integrity is organized twice a year. RDM is a central theme during this workshop. Academic Integrity is a mandatory part of the URSI PhD program; the educational program for the PhD students of the Graduate School. Also, a RDM Workshop is being developed. This workshop is targeted at helping PhD students with the development of their RDM Plan in the Tool. Also, immediate feedback is given."
university-of-groningen.md,## 13.  Ensuring compliance
university-of-groningen.md,The Faculty Board will maintain oversight and will supervise practices related to data storage and management.
university-of-groningen.md,Researchers are responsible for submitting an RDMP within 3 months of commencement of a research project. A CIT/Library Data Steward is available for advice and reminders.
university-of-groningen.md,"At the time of the 9 month go/no-go interview, all PhD candidates will need to declare that they are familiar with the Dutch Code of Conduct for Academic Practice; that they will obey this code. They will also be required to have completed a Research Data Management Plan using the Research Data Management Tool."
university-of-groningen.md,"On completion of their PhD studies, the PhD team (PhD student and supervisors) will be responsible for ensuring that the PhD student will archive all research data in the repository. The data should be accessible by the supervisor after the PhD student has left. On termination of the contract of a staff member, data should be lodged in the repository."
university-of-groningen.md,## 14.  Roles and Tasks

university-of-göttingen.md,# Research data policy of the Georg-August University Goettingen (incl. UMG)
university-of-göttingen.md,Preamble
university-of-göttingen.md,"The Georg-August-University Goettingen is committed to diligently preserve results of scholarship, to produce novel results through research, and to make results accessible and reusable for academia and the wider society, now and for future generations. The management, protection, preservation and sustainable provision of research data must therefore be carried out in accordance with recognized standards, meet high expectations and fulfil legal and ethical obligations. The University acknowledges that the implementation of this guideline will depend on the settings and requirements of each subject area."
university-of-göttingen.md,1. The University promotes and supports open access to research data.
university-of-göttingen.md,"2. Research data are those data collected, observed, simulated, derived, or generated during the course of research."
university-of-göttingen.md,"3. Management of research data includes their planning, collection, processing, and preservation. It ensures the access to, and the reuse, reproducibility, and quality assurance of all research data underpinning research results."
university-of-göttingen.md,4. Research data management is generally the responsibility of the person leading a project and the researcher who is acting in an individual capacity. A particular responsibility is the adherence to good practices of research as well as standards in their subject area.
university-of-göttingen.md,5. Research projects with research data require a data management plan that includes but is not restricted to the topics of access rights to research data and necessary precautions for handling them.
university-of-göttingen.md,"6. The University provides support and advice for research data management in the preparatory stages of research projects, during their conduct and after their completion, and provides appropriate training."

university-of-helsinki.md,### 1. Introduction
university-of-helsinki.md,"Research data are central to science and research. The production of data requires long-term efforts as well as technical and financial resources. In fact, the reusability of research data has become an increasingly important question in terms both of science and research, and of the impact of research."
university-of-helsinki.md,"For the University of Helsinki as well as its units and researchers, research data constitute a strategic resource and an international competitive factor. The goal of the University is to promote responsible research data management, which is of crucial significance for the findability, accessibility and reuse of research-based knowledge (for the definition of ‘research data’ and ‘research data management’, see the glossary)."
university-of-helsinki.md,"The principles of open science and open research data play a prominent role in the strategic plan of the University of Helsinki for 2021–2030. The University’s strategic goals include open research infrastructures and open research data, the implementation of the FAIR Principles in research data management, and the advancement of competencies in the analysis of large and open datasets."
university-of-helsinki.md,A key goal of the research data policy is to guide everyone involved in research data management to familiarise themselves with current data management requirements as well as to adopt good and responsible practices as part of everyday research activities. Another goal is to make research data management increasingly clear for individual researchers.
university-of-helsinki.md,"From an organisational perspective, the research data policy describes the goals that guide the development of research data services at the University of Helsinki. The goal is for University of Helsinki researchers to have at their disposal infrastructures and services that enable responsible research data management, developed in an economically sustainable manner while taking researchers’ needs into account."
university-of-helsinki.md,"In terms of its fundamental goals, the new research data policy of the University of Helsinki does not significantly differ from the previous policy published in 2015. The new policy has been amended to comply with current legislation as well as national and international guidelines and recommendations. In contrast to the previous policy, whose more limited scope only encompassed digital data, the new research data policy applies to all research data and related management principles. Another important change is the further clarification and highlighting of responsibilities."
university-of-helsinki.md,#### 1.1 Scope of the research data policy
university-of-helsinki.md,"This research data policy covers all research conducted at the University of Helsinki, as well as the research data collected and produced in conjunction with it. This denotes both digital data as well as physical and analogue data, which are all referred to as research data in the research data policy (for the definition of ‘research data’, see the glossary)."
university-of-helsinki.md,"The research data policy applies to all members of the University community involved in research, including University employees and students as well as those who conduct research on behalf of the University."
university-of-helsinki.md,1.2 Other policies pertaining to research data management at the University of Helsinki
university-of-helsinki.md,"The principles and goals presented in the research data policy supplement other University of Helsinki policies relevant to the management of research data, including the principles of open science, the data protection principles, the information security policy and the guidelines of the Finnish National Board on Research Integrity for the responsible conduct of research. The research data policy is also in line with the University’s data management practices and principles."
university-of-helsinki.md,"Policies related to research data management at the University of Helsinki are guided primarily by EU and Finnish law. By employing policies and guidelines, the University strives to ensure the legality of research activities. In international research and other cooperation, research data management can also be regulated by legislation outside the European Union."
university-of-helsinki.md,External research funders and partners may also have specific requirements for research data management.
university-of-helsinki.md,"The general objectives for the processing of data stored in University of Helsinki research infrastructures or those on the national or international level are described in the University of Helsinki Research Infrastructure Programme (for the definition of ‘research infrastructure’, see the glossary). In addition, national and international research infrastructures may have their own jointly agreed policies for the processing of the data that they produce. When research infrastructures draw up or update their data management principles, their alignment with the University’s research data policy must be ensured."
university-of-helsinki.md,#### 1.3 Research agreements and agreeing on rights
university-of-helsinki.md,#### Research agreements
university-of-helsinki.md,"Concluding agreements and undertakings is an important part of responsible data management, regardless of the source of research funding. Agreements are always needed when research is conducted in a collaboration or other partnership with external parties, such as other universities, businesses, research organisations and hospital districts. Agreements help to safeguard the interests of researchers and the University of Helsinki, manage risks related to research and ensure the legality of activities."
university-of-helsinki.md,"Research agreements must be concluded as early as possible, preferably before the collection or use of research data commences. Agreements are used to ensure that the research data collaboratively collected by research groups is available to all of the participating researchers. Agreements safeguard the continuity of research and the further use of research data, for example, after the conclusion of research projects."
university-of-helsinki.md,#### Agreeing on rights related to research data
university-of-helsinki.md,"Many international and national research funders require that the research data and findings that they have funded are open access. Obligations imposed by funders on researchers and the University make it necessary to transfer rights to research data to the extent necessary to fulfil the funding terms. In addition, the sharing of rights is needed, for example, to enable the opening,"
university-of-helsinki.md,"further use and archiving of research data. As a rule, researchers retain a concurrent right that enables them to continue using the research data."
university-of-helsinki.md,The rights related to research data and their sharing should be agreed when researchers’ employment at the University begins.
university-of-helsinki.md,"Agreeing on the rights related to research data is in line with legislation and the responsible conduct of research. Instead of altering researchers’ responsibilities in the management of their research datasets, such agreements are part of it. Sharing rights does not alter researchers’ right to be referred to as the collectors or producers of the research data in question."
university-of-helsinki.md,#### 1.4 Updating and monitoring the research data policy
university-of-helsinki.md,This document supersedes the current University of Helsinki research data policy that was approved in 2015. An implementation plan for the updated data policy will be drawn up in 2022.
university-of-helsinki.md,"The implementation of the research data policy will be monitored by carrying out assessments at regular intervals, the first in 2023."
university-of-helsinki.md,The research data policy will be updated by 2025.
university-of-helsinki.md,### 2. Principles and goals for research data management
university-of-helsinki.md,#### 2.1 General principles
university-of-helsinki.md,"Below, the principles and goals for responsible research data management are described in relation to the lifespan of research projects, beginning from the planning of data management and ending in the long-term preservation or destruction of data. The potential for the further use of data must be taken into consideration during research projects."
university-of-helsinki.md,"In general, the responsible management of research data is guided by the FAIR Principles, according to which research data must be findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (for the definition of the ‘FAIR Principles’, see the glossary). Another guiding principle pertains to the openness of research data: as open as possible, as closed as necessary."
university-of-helsinki.md,#### 2.2 Planning and preparation of data management
university-of-helsinki.md,"A data management plan is to be drawn up for all research projects. The plan is to be updated during the project whenever substantial changes are made to the content (for the definition of ‘data management plan', see the glossary)."
university-of-helsinki.md,Questions related to legislation and research ethics are taken into consideration in the data management plan.
university-of-helsinki.md,"When processing personal data, the University of Helsinki data protection guidelines on informing data subjects and ensuring the necessary safety measures are to be taken into account. When necessary, a data protection impact assessment must be carried out (for the definition of ‘personal data’, see the glossary)."
university-of-helsinki.md,"The rights and responsibilities related to research are to be agreed within research groups, while the relevant agreements are to be concluded with external parties prior to"
university-of-helsinki.md,commencing the collection or use of research data.
university-of-helsinki.md,"Preparations must be made for the protection and, when necessary, anonymisation of sensitive data as well as the destruction of confidential data, with sufficient resources allocated at the planning stage of research projects (for the definition of ‘sensitive and confidential data', see the glossary)."
university-of-helsinki.md,"Agreements, consents, undertakings and other documents related to research must be archived so that they are always available to researchers and support services."
university-of-helsinki.md,"Research infrastructures extensively involved in service provision in particular should draw up a data management policy describing the principles of processing, storing, distributing, preserving and destroying data produced by the infrastructure, as well as the questions of responsibility and ownership related to the processing of data."
university-of-helsinki.md,#### 2.3 Documentation and processing of research data
university-of-helsinki.md,"The documentation and metadata associated with research data should follow disciplinespecific standards to enable the reuse and further enrichment of the data in future research projects (for the definition of ‘metadata’, see the glossary). Appropriate information security must be taken into consideration in the storage and processing of research data. The University provides researchers with basic services in the storage and processing of research data. If the quantity of data is high or special computing power is needed, the costs of storage and processing must be taken into consideration at the planning stage."
university-of-helsinki.md,#### 2.4 Publication and accessibility of research data
university-of-helsinki.md,"Research data produced at the University of Helsinki and linked to published research results are, as a rule, open and available for shared use. The principle of ‘as open as possible, as closed as necessary’ is observed when making research data openly available. Research data are published in data archives that safeguard the findability of data and enable references to them (for the definition of ‘data archive’, see the glossary)."
university-of-helsinki.md,"Metadata associated with research data must be published whenever possible, either in national or international metadata services."
university-of-helsinki.md,"Identifiers and licences enabling the further use of data should always be available for open research data (for the definition of ‘persistent identifier’, see the glossary)."
university-of-helsinki.md,"If possible, sensitive data are also made available to other researchers, taking into consideration legal, ethical and contractual restrictions. In this, services that enable safe storage and restricted access with a research permit are to be employed."
university-of-helsinki.md,"The University has practices and services for data collection and monitoring pertaining to previously collected, produced and opened research data."
university-of-helsinki.md,#### 2.5 Commercialisation of research data
university-of-helsinki.md,"In the case of commercially valuable data, measures must be taken to ensure that their use does not endanger commercialisation. For example, research results must be published in compliance with terms and conditions set on confidentiality by the funder as well as the University’s guidelines for commercialisation. In the case of research that generates commercially valuable research data, the University provides researchers with support and a streamlined service process."
university-of-helsinki.md,#### 2.6. Destruction or long-term preservation of research data
university-of-helsinki.md,"The part of research data that is valuable in the long term and that will be preserved, as well as the part that will be destroyed at the end must be specified during research projects. Research data that have become useless will be destroyed after the required storage period. Research data that contain sensitive data will be destroyed with particular care. The University has a process for the curation and transfer to long-term digital preservation of valuable research data (for the definition of ‘long-term preservation’, see the glossary)."

university-of-helsinki.md,#### Data archive (data repository)
university-of-helsinki.md,"A virtual, typically discipline-specific archive or database where researchers can transfer their research data for sharing, reporting and reuse. Data repositories store research data, make it available and organise it in a logical manner. Data repositories also make it easier to cite research data through the use of persistent identifiers."
university-of-helsinki.md,#### Data management plan
university-of-helsinki.md,"A document that describes the research data that will be acquired or produced in the research project, commonly abbreviated as DMP. In connection with data management plans, the term ‘data’ is understood in broad terms, meaning that it encompasses all of the data and resources on which the research results are based. The plan also encompasses codes, software and other methodological descriptions."
university-of-helsinki.md,"In addition, the plan describes how rights related to research data are managed, which agreements are needed, how data protection is ensured, how research data are stored, how research data are opened, or how their findability and use for the verification of the research results and further research is otherwise enabled. While the data management plan is drawn up at the planning stage, it is a living document that must be updated as the research project progresses."
university-of-helsinki.md,#### FAIR Principles
university-of-helsinki.md,"European principles for the quality of research data and associated metadata. The acronym FAIR stands for findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable. The FAIR Principles guide the drawing up of metadata in particular. Findable means that research data has a unique persistent identifier that functions as a link to the data that can always be found even if the storage location changes. Findability can also be implemented for non-digital research data whose metadata are openly available. Accessible means that research data and the associated metadata are accessible via web browsers. Interoperable means that data are stored using open file formats and common standards. Reusable means that research data has rich metadata and a licence that specifies the terms of reuse."
university-of-helsinki.md,#### Information security incident
university-of-helsinki.md,"An event or circumstances that diverge from normal, which may, for example, delay, prevent or harm the conduct of research. The nature of such incidents varies by research field."
university-of-helsinki.md,"Information security incident related to data protection refer to circumstances due to which research data are destroyed, lost, altered or disclosed without authorisation, or due to which an unauthorised party gains access to the data."
university-of-helsinki.md,#### Long-term preservation
university-of-helsinki.md,"The preservation of digital data in understandable and usable form for dozens or even hundreds of years. Long-term preservation is designed for valuable research data. The goal of long-term preservation is to ensure the accessibility, authenticity, understandability and completeness of digital objects, also regardless of the eventual obsolescence of or changes to hardware, software and file formats. Long-term preservation ensures the long-term availability of research data."
university-of-helsinki.md,#### Metadata
university-of-helsinki.md,"Metadata is data about data. There are several types of metadata, including descriptive, structural, administrative, statistical and legal as well as reference and citation metadata. Metadata ensures the findability and reusability of research data. When research data is described and documented appropriately, other users can trace and understand specific elements of research. Metadata makes it easier to search for and find research data stored in data repositories."
university-of-helsinki.md,#### Persistent identifier
university-of-helsinki.md,"A unique and unambiguous, machine-readable name for research output, commonly abbreviated as PID. Identifiers constitute permanent links that always lead to, for example, publications or metadata pages associated with research data. Persistent identifiers enable the long-term findability of digital research data."
university-of-helsinki.md,#### Personal data
university-of-helsinki.md,"Any data that can be linked to living natural persons, that is, data associated with or linkable to an identified or identifiable person. Any data that can be used to indirectly identify a person, for example, by linking a specific detail to another detail that would enable identification (pseudonymised personal data) also constitute personal data. Personal data can be stored in, for example, digital files and databases, on paper, in card indexes, in document files and survey forms, or in audio or video recordings."
university-of-helsinki.md,"According to data protection regulation, specific personal data constitute what is known as special categories of personal data, or sensitive personal data (see also ‘sensitive and confidential data’):"
university-of-helsinki.md,"Data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs or"
university-of-helsinki.md,trade union membership
university-of-helsinki.md,Genetic data
university-of-helsinki.md,Biometric data processed for the purpose of uniquely identifying a person
university-of-helsinki.md,Data concerning health Data concerning a person’s sex life or sexual orientation Data concerning criminal convictions or offences
university-of-helsinki.md,"In addition to the data above, the processing of personal data can be sensitive if the processing may pose risks to the data subjects (see ‘risk management’)."
university-of-helsinki.md,#### Research data
university-of-helsinki.md,"Data that have been collected, observed, measured or created to verify research results, or that are otherwise considered necessary in the research community for the confirmation of results. The context turns data into research data. Any data can become research data when it is analysed for research purposes."
university-of-helsinki.md,"Research data can include measurement results, test results, survey results, audio and video recordings as well as samples and specimens. While research data is often in digital form, it can also include physical or analogue data. Research data can be raw data, processed data, data in the possession of a third party, shared data or published data. The degree of openness of research data varies from confidential and sensitive data to open data."
university-of-helsinki.md,#### Research data infrastructure
university-of-helsinki.md,"Processes, technical solutions and services through which research data management is carried out in practice. Research data infrastructures involve organisation, an operating culture and longterm social networks that enable the realisation of technical and administrative solutions and services."
university-of-helsinki.md,#### Research data management
university-of-helsinki.md,"Commonly referred to using the abbreviation RDM. A process encompassing the lifespan of the research project that includes the collection or acquisition, organisation, curation, storage, (longterm) preservation, protection, quality assurance, licensing and distribution of research data as well as the use of persistent identifiers and other metadata in compliance with the rules and procedures of the relevant discipline (European Commission/Horizon Europe)."
university-of-helsinki.md,#### Research infrastructure
university-of-helsinki.md,"Research infrastructures are instruments, equipment, information networks, databases, materials and services that serve to facilitate research, promote research collaboration and reinforce research and innovation capacity and know-how (Academy of Finland)."
university-of-helsinki.md,#### Risk management
university-of-helsinki.md,"Proactive anticipation of events that have negative consequences. Risk management constitutes coordinated activities used to guide, manage and monitor the actions of the University, its units or individual researchers in relation to risks. The purpose of risk management is to help the University, its units and researchers to attain their goals and make decisions."
university-of-helsinki.md,"When processing personal data (see the definition of ‘personal data’), the risks associated with the processing must be assessed while ensuring the implementation of the relevant data protection principles. In the case of personal data, the risk assessment must be carried out from the perspective of data subjects."
university-of-helsinki.md,#### Sensitive and confidential data
university-of-helsinki.md,"Research data whose storage, use and sharing are restricted on ethical, legal, contractual or commercial grounds. Such data must be processed and protected with particular care."
university-of-helsinki.md,"Sensitive data are associated with, for example, specific personal data (see special categories of personal data in the definition of ‘personal data’), endangered species, biosecurity or national defence. Confidential information on patents and trade secrets are also to be protected, and their exposure can result in claims for damages."

university-of-huddersfield.md,# RESEARCH DATA MANAGEMENT POLICY
university-of-huddersfield.md,## 1. Introduction
university-of-huddersfield.md,### 1.1 Statement of intent
university-of-huddersfield.md,"1.1.1 The University of Huddersfield’s academic community produces large volumes of research data, and wishes to ensure the widest possible access to its world-class research. The value and utility of research outputs increases the more broadly they are available to be considered and used by others, including scholars, businesses and charities around the globe, as well as society in general. Open Data and shared research data will also help to highlight the excellence of its research. It will attract scholars and students, foster collaboration, and enhance public engagement with research, as well as maximise the intellectual, social, cultural and economic impact of research."
university-of-huddersfield.md,1.1.2 The University of Huddersfield supports the Concordat on Open Research Data and the UKRI general policies and guidance on research data which encourage members of the UK research community to make openly available research data they have gathered and generated.  The University is committed to reviewing new initiatives in this area as they arise and supporting them as deemed appropriate.
university-of-huddersfield.md,"1.1.3 The University of Huddersfield also recognises that good practice in data management is key to an efficient and effective research process. It is essential for enabling and safeguarding the longevity and continuing intelligibility of data, and for ensuring that sensitive data is handled in compliance with all relevant ethical and legal requirements. Preserving the data that underpins research outputs, whether it is shared or not, is integral to research integrity and reproducibility of results."
university-of-huddersfield.md,### 1.2 Purpose
university-of-huddersfield.md,"1.2.1 There is an increased requirement on researchers to effectively preserve their research data with the intention of sharing it publicly, while at the same time respecting concerns in relation to privacy, safety, security and commercial interests; this is under the assumption that the outputs of University research are a public good, produced in the public interest and for societal benefit. This policy aims to establish the measures needed to facilitate the appropriate curation and management of data, to secure its longevity and its potential to be shared."
university-of-huddersfield.md,"1.2.2 This policy is intended to help promote good practice around research data, with the particular aim that it is:"
university-of-huddersfield.md,"stored securely and preserved in order to ensure its continuing utility; appropriately identifiable, retrievable, and available when needed; an accurate, complete, reliable and coherent representation of the materials collected;"
university-of-huddersfield.md,"kept in a manner that is compliant with legal obligations, including the Data Protection Act 2018 / The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 2018 and the Freedom of Information Act 2000, and, where applicable, the requirements of funding bodies;"
university-of-huddersfield.md,"able to be made available to others in line with appropriate ethical, data sharing and open access principles, especially when the data"
university-of-huddersfield.md,underpins published research.
university-of-huddersfield.md,### 1.3 Definition of Research Data
university-of-huddersfield.md,"Research data: the recorded information (regardless of the form or the media in which it may exist) necessary to support or validate a research project’s observations, findings or outputs, or which is required for legal or regulatory compliance."
university-of-huddersfield.md,## 2. Responsibilities of the University
university-of-huddersfield.md,2.1 The University will provide:
university-of-huddersfield.md,"support, advice and information to researchers on all aspects of research data management"
university-of-huddersfield.md,"suitable infrastructure to facilitate the appropriate management, archiving and sharing of research data."
university-of-huddersfield.md,training and guidance to promote best practice in research data management.
university-of-huddersfield.md,"2.2 In order to support and enable this policy, the University is committed to engaging with researchers to fulfil the mutual responsibilities. The university will endeavour to provide research data management services and infrastructure capabilities which are adequate and fit for the purpose of supporting researchers’ compliance with the policy, particularly for academic staff and PGRs with externally funded research projects."
university-of-huddersfield.md,2.3 The University has set an archiving period of no less than 10 years for all externally funded research data.
university-of-huddersfield.md,## 3. Responsibilities of the researcher
university-of-huddersfield.md,3.1 Principal Investigators (unless a defined role of data manager is assigned within the project group) are required to prepare a data management plan (DMP) which describes the data management life cycle for the data to be collected and processed by a research project. DMPs are usually required as part of research proposals for external funding and the University encourages similar best practice for internally funded projects. DMPs should include information on:
university-of-huddersfield.md,the handling of research data during and after the end of the project
university-of-huddersfield.md,"what data will be collected, processed and/or generated"
university-of-huddersfield.md,which methodology and standards will be applied
university-of-huddersfield.md,whether data will be shared/made open access and
university-of-huddersfield.md,how data will be curated and preserved (including after the end of the project)
university-of-huddersfield.md,"3.2 Principal Investigators (unless a defined role of data manager is assigned within the project group) hold day-to-day responsibility for the effective management of research data generated within or obtained from their research, including by their research groups. This shall include understanding and complying with the requirements of any relevant contract with or grant to the University that includes provisions regarding the ownership, preservation and dissemination of research data."
university-of-huddersfield.md,"3.3 Researchers will protect confidential, personal and sensitive personal research data in accordance with legal and ethical requirements related to the research they conduct."
university-of-huddersfield.md,"3.4 Researchers will make every reasonable effort to keep an accurate and comprehensive record of their research, including documenting clear procedures for the collection, storage, use, reuse, access and retention or deletion of the research data associated with their records. Where appropriate, this should include defining and documenting protocols and responsibilities in collaborative research projects."
university-of-huddersfield.md,3.4 Researchers will make every reasonable effort to recognise Intellectual Property arising from their research activities and manage that Intellectual Property according to any funder requirements or contractual obligations.
university-of-huddersfield.md,"3.5 Researchers will preserve and provide appropriate access to their research data supporting outputs after the end of their project for as long as it has continuing value, in accordance with legal and funder requirements and paying due regard to discipline norms and cost. Notwithstanding, the minimum retention period for research data and records is ten years after publication or public release of the work of the research. School Research Ethics Committees can consider and approve proposals from PIs to retain data for shorter periods of time where reasoned arguments are provided e.g. where individuals participating in the research may be put at significant risk of identification."
university-of-huddersfield.md,"3.6 Researchers should deposit their data in an appropriate data repository along with sufficient descriptive metadata (a data record) to ensure that it can be found and understood. Where academic staff deposit data somewhere other than the University’s institutional data repository (the University of Huddersfield Research Portal), a metadata record should still be created in the portal which describes and points to the data."
university-of-huddersfield.md,"3.7 Published papers which rely on data generated by the authors should include a data access statement even where there are no data associated with the article or the data are inaccessible, In line with UKRI policy on Open access. Authors should also apply good data citation principles and formally cite data which has directly informed the conclusions drawn in their papers."
university-of-huddersfield.md,"3.8 Researchers are responsible for agreeing arrangements (with their Research Centre Director or nominee) as to where their research data will be stored and who will have access to this after they leave (or retire from) the University.  The researcher’s department or School reserves the right to retain a copy of the data for an appropriate period to ensure compliance with any legal or regulatory responsibilities, and/or research grant or contractual requirements."
university-of-huddersfield.md,3.9 Researchers can obtain advice and support from the Research Data Management Team (rdm@hud.ac.uk) team.

university-of-hull.md,# Research Data Management and Sharing Policy 2023
university-of-hull.md,### Introduction
university-of-hull.md,### Background
university-of-hull.md,"1. The University of Hull is committed to the delivery of high-quality research and both requires and fosters the practice of research to high standards across all disciplines.  The University has laid out its expectations in the Statement on Research Integrity (2023), Code of Good Research Practice (2023), and Research Ethics Policy (2023)."
university-of-hull.md,2. A key element of this delivery is the dissemination of the outputs from research to communicate the research findings to the widest possible audience and achieve a broad societal impact.  This dissemination recognises that the outputs from research are valuable assets meriting curation to support ongoing access and are a major component of the knowledge legacy generated by the University.
university-of-hull.md,"3. Whilst acknowledging the primary focus of attention on publications as outputs from research, the University also recognises the intrinsic value of data generated through research.  Research data underpin the research process and provide the core basis of the research analysis that feeds into publications and other dissemination activity."
university-of-hull.md,4. The effective management of research data contributes to research integrity by ensuring that the analysis disseminated through research outputs has a sound basis.  It also contributes to a culture of honesty and accuracy in research practice and underpins research reproducibility by facilitating transparency in research practice.
university-of-hull.md,### Purpose
university-of-hull.md,"5. The purpose of this policy is to establish principles for effective management of the research data generated within the University plus its dissemination, through sharing of this data where appropriate.  The policy provides the link between research practice and the data it produces, the management and curation of research data, including legal criteria that need attention, sharing research data with others, and the responsibilities that stakeholders in the research process have to ensure success in working with research data."
university-of-hull.md,"6. This policy seeks to support adherence with funder and journal policies related to research data. It is recognised that these policies continue to evolve, and supporting guidance will be adjusted to meet changing requirements as needed."
university-of-hull.md,### Scope
university-of-hull.md,"7. This policy applies to all research carried out at the University of Hull, whether conducted by staff or students, funded externally or by the University (respecting where contracts with private funders may have specific requirements).  The policy does not apply to data gathered through regular business and administrative activity of the University, although it is recognised that the principles and practice detailed in this and related documents may also be of benefit in ensuring effective management of data in those areas."
university-of-hull.md,8. The policy applies to data that are both digital and non-digital.
university-of-hull.md,"9. The principles of the policy can be used to inform the management of research data created at any time, but the policy itself applies to research data created from the date of implementation of this policy."

university-of-hull.md,"10. The policy has been developed in the context of external guidance within the research community.  In particular, the policy is aligned to the following documents:"
university-of-hull.md,"a. The FAIR Guiding Principles (2016),"
university-of-hull.md,"b. The UKRI Common Principles on Data Policy (updated 2022),"
university-of-hull.md,"c. The Concordat on Open Research Data (2016),"
university-of-hull.md,"11. This policy sets out principles that apply across all areas of research.  It is recognised that there will be disciplinary norms and differences in the definition and understanding of research data, and its management and sharing.  Where there are specific disciplinary data management requirements, these should be acknowledged and accommodated within the research data management and sharing practice carried out."
university-of-hull.md,### Definitions
university-of-hull.md,"12. Research data – For the purposes of this policy, and acknowledging disciplinary differences in interpretation, research data refer to any material collected, observed, constructed, generated, or created for the purpose of research analysis, and on which research conclusions are based1."
university-of-hull.md,"13. Data management plan – A data management plan (DMP) is a document that records intentions to gather, store, manage, disseminate and preserve research data.  A DMP provides a methodology for working with data through a research process, and as a checklist to ensure the maintenance and development of good practice over time."
university-of-hull.md,"14. Data curation – Data curation involves the active management of research data to maintain, preserve and add value to the data throughout its lifetime."
university-of-hull.md,"15. Data catalogue – A data catalogue is a record of the existence of datasets, with each being described using a metadata record (which may be brief or detailed according to the complexity of the data)."
university-of-hull.md,"16. Data repository – A data repository is a location or service that can be used to preserve, curate and share research data over time.  Its focus is on preserving final datasets after the research generating the data has been completed, though snapshots of data being added to over time can also be included."
university-of-hull.md,"17. Data sharing – Data sharing in the context of this policy involves making research data available for others to utilise, through deposit in a data repository with an open licence, or a private arrangement with an individual or team.   A key part of sharing data is the creation of suitable metadata or data documentation describing the data to facilitate access and understanding about the data."
university-of-hull.md,"18. Data access statement – A statement of the way(s) in which research data can be accessed. This may range from provision of a web link to a downloadable file to contact details to support a conversation about how data might be made available (e.g., if the files are large).  A data access statement may also be used to indicate why access is not available, for instance if data is sensitive or the rights-holder unknown."
university-of-hull.md,### Principles
university-of-hull.md,#### Research practice
university-of-hull.md,"19. Where research data contains personal or sensitive information, the management of the data must be included in the ethical approval for the research in accordance with the Research Ethics Policy."
university-of-hull.md,20. Managing research data is a key researcher skill alongside other research skills (See Principle #9 in the Concordat on Open Research Data): the University will provide training to enable researchers to develop this skill and put it into practice.
university-of-hull.md,21. Research induction and continuing researcher professional development must include reference to research data management and this policy so staff and students are aware of the requirements upon them.
university-of-hull.md,"22. In keeping with wider research practice, the use of ORCID identifiers for researchers is recommended to assist with the effective management and sharing of research data."
university-of-hull.md,#### Managing data
university-of-hull.md,The management of research data is a task carried out by all researchers in all disciplines to some degree.  This policy highlights the benefits of a structured approach to that task.
university-of-hull.md,23.  A vital element of the management process is the development of a data management plan (DMP).  All research projects must create a DMP relevant to the needs of the project as part of their documentation for the project.  DMPs are working documents and should be updated in line with project developments; each version should be preserved alongside other project documentation.
university-of-hull.md,"24. The amount of research data being generated will vary from project to project.  In each case researchers must at an early stage assess the scale of the data and make suitable arrangements for it to be stored and backed up.  Where IT storage services will be used, early communication with IT Services must be undertaken to inform appropriate practice based on requirements."
university-of-hull.md,"25. Where the research data constitutes or includes software, the software should be maintained through an appropriate code repository to facilitate management and support reproducibility."
university-of-hull.md,"26. Research planning should account for any costs associated with managing data, including its storage and staff time involved.  Where funders can provide support for such costs, or a proportion of them, this should be included in grant applications."
university-of-hull.md,"27. Research data should be managed in keeping with best current practice for data curation, acknowledging disciplinary norms as part of this.  This should include assignment of a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) or other appropriate persistent identifier to datasets for discoverability and citation."
university-of-hull.md,"28. All data management plans must give consideration to the date of expiry for the data, which, unless there are specific funder requirements otherwise, must not exceed seven years from the date of deposit.  All data reaching their expiry date or the seven-year limit must be reviewed by appropriate academic and professional services staff to inform future management, or agree on deletion of the data."
university-of-hull.md,"29. Completed research datasets generated by the University must have a metadata record created within the current research information system (CRIS), linked to the project(s) that produced it, providing a data catalogue; this will include data stored locally at the University and data stored at third party services externally.  Where data is deleted, the record must be kept, but updated to record when the deletion took place."
university-of-hull.md,30. Non-digital data will require specific management according to the type of data involved.  The precise arrangements for such management must be incorporated within the DMP for the research in question.
university-of-hull.md,### Sharing data
university-of-hull.md,"31. In keeping with the value inherent in open access to research outputs, publishing data with an open licence is an aim for all research at the University.  This policy recognises that there are occasionally valid reasons why data cannot be made open, and these reasons must be recorded as part of the data catalogue record.  Licence choice must take account of associated funder requirements."
university-of-hull.md,32. Researchers involved in the creation of the data have the right to exploit the data for an agreed period prior to sharing it (see Principle #4 in the Concordat on Open Research Data and Point 5 in the UKRI Common Principles on Data Policy).  Guidance from funders and/or subject communities should be followed on the length of such a period: where no such guidance is available a locally agreed time limit that takes account of disciplinary practice will be applied.
university-of-hull.md,33. When data is being shared it must have an extended metadata record describing what the dataset contains to facilitate access and use.  Additional data documentation should be provided where appropriate to facilitate utilization of the data.
university-of-hull.md,"34. Where research data is referenced in publications, a data access statement must be included."
university-of-hull.md,"35. Where research data is sourced externally and used within research at the University, it must be appropriately referenced as an acknowledged source in any publications arising from the research.  Research data generated at the University must be citeable by others using the metadata in the CRIS record (see paragraphs 30/31): this metadata must include the DOI or other appropriate persistent identifier assigned to aid discovery."
university-of-hull.md,"36. Research data can be shared through an appropriate data repository, which may be local or via a third-party service: where possible this repository should have trusted digital repository (TDR) status.  If the latter option is chosen, the service should adhere to the principles within this policy."
university-of-hull.md,### Legal2
university-of-hull.md,"37. All data created through research at the University by employees is owned by the University, unless there are contractual arrangements that specify otherwise."
university-of-hull.md,"38. Researchers who leave the University should ensure that access to a copy of the data, whether at the University or at a third party, is available prior to leaving: details of such access must be recorded in the DMP for a dataset, which must be stored and made available alongside other project documentation."
university-of-hull.md,"39. Students may own the data they generate, dependent on the source of their funding, but must clarify this and any shared ownership and authorship the University may claim with staff/supervisors at an early stage in the research process and record this within the DMP."
university-of-hull.md,"40. Where research data is shared for dissemination, an appropriate licence must be applied to facilitate access and usage by others."
university-of-hull.md,"41. Conversely, data sourced externally must be used in accordance with any licensing attached to this.  Exclusive rights to reuse or publish research data must not be handed over to commercial publishers or agents."
university-of-hull.md,"42. Research data must be managed in accordance with the University’s Data Protection Policy3, and specifically the Data Principles within paragraph 6 of that Policy. It is acknowledged that legislative requirements may alter over time and that data management and sharing must take account of such changes as they occur."
university-of-hull.md,43. Data must be held securely and used only for the purpose that has been consented.
university-of-hull.md,"44. Care must be taken over who has access to such data, and details of such access rights recorded in the DMP."
university-of-hull.md,### Responsibilities
university-of-hull.md,#### Overall responsibility
university-of-hull.md,The management of research data is a collaborative activity that involves multiple stakeholders across the University.  It is recognised that only through working together can the University effectively achieve the principles outlined in this document.
university-of-hull.md,"45. Primary responsibility for the management and sharing of data in accordance with the principles set out in this policy lies with the Principal Investigator (PI) or supervisor for the research being carried out.  Details of how this responsibility is exercised must be recorded within the DMP. Where the PI leaves the University, responsibility should be delegated to an appropriate colleague: if no such delegation takes place responsibility for the data will be the responsibility of the PI’s School or Institute."
university-of-hull.md,#### Heads of School/Directors of Institute responsibilities
university-of-hull.md,46. It is the responsibility of Heads of School/Directors of Institutes to ensure good practice and legal obligations are met relating to the management and sharing of research data within their area.
university-of-hull.md,47. Heads of School/Directors of Institutes should identify and arrange for any training or skills development required in carrying out the above responsibility and in support of PIs in exercising their responsibilities.
university-of-hull.md,#### Ethics Committees
university-of-hull.md,48. Ethics Committees are responsible for ensuring that where projects make use of or generate research data that requires management under the terms of the Research Ethics Policy that the project has established the research data management practice required for ethical clearance.
university-of-hull.md,#### Researcher responsibilities (where researcher is an employee)
university-of-hull.md,"49. Researchers are responsible for ensuring that research data they work with is managed, and shared where appropriate, in accordance with the principles set out in this policy."
university-of-hull.md,"50. Researchers must make every reasonable effort to keep an accurate and comprehensive record of their research and associated research data in keeping with the Code for Good Research Practice, to demonstrate good practice and underpin adherence to the principles of this policy."
university-of-hull.md,"51. Researchers must ensure that research data management and sharing carried out under the aegis of collaborative projects, involving partners external to the University, is suitably documented to make clear the University’s responsibilities during and beyond the project’s lifetime in respect of the data generated from the collaboration."
university-of-hull.md,#### Postgraduate research student and supervisor responsibilities
university-of-hull.md,52. It is the responsibility of postgraduate research students and their supervisors to ensure that research data management is planned and documented at the outset of the research project to fully inform work with research data during and beyond the period of doctoral study.
university-of-hull.md,#### University responsibilities

university-of-lincoln.md,University of Lincoln: Research Data Management Policy
university-of-lincoln.md,## Research Data Management Policy
university-of-lincoln.md,Version 2.0
university-of-lincoln.md,Date: 25 May 2018
university-of-lincoln.md,The purpose of this policy is to set out the University's expectations for the management and curation of research data across all academic disciplines and in all forms. The University recognises the value of sharing research data openly where appropriate as a way to promote scholarly discourse and support learning and teaching and therefore aspires to be a leader in open data practices.
university-of-lincoln.md,"This policy is applicable to all staff and students and should be read in conjunction with the University's Code of Practice for Research, which reflects the principles and commitments outlined in the Concordat to Support Research Integrity, the University’s Open access publications policy and Research Ethics Policy."
university-of-lincoln.md,"The University of Lincoln recognises that the curation and sharing of research data is key to its mission to develop and create knowledge. This brings benefits to the University, its members and the public through greater opportunities for access and re-use. Research data is defined as data acquired or generated in the course of research undertaken at the University and its management refers to storage, preservation, discovery, and provision for access and re-use."
university-of-lincoln.md,The University recognises and supports the UK Research & Innovation Common Principles1 on Data Policy mandates as best practice for data curation and sharing.
university-of-lincoln.md,"This policy aims to address the requirements of researchers, the public, funding and statutory bodies and commercial partners and set out the principles to ensure that research data will be managed, curated and shared to the highest standards throughout the research data lifecycle."
university-of-lincoln.md,"1. Researchers should consider data creation, management and sharing in a ‘Data Management Plan (DMP)’ which should explicitly address data capture, protection, management, integrity, confidentiality, evaluation, retention, sharing and publication. DMPs should take into consideration compliance with relevant legislative frameworks which may limit public access to data (e.g. in areas of data protection (point 5), intellectual property and human rights). Further details on DMPs are available from the Digital Curation Centre2."
university-of-lincoln.md,"2. While a DMP, or its equivalent, is sometimes a requirement of the research funding, it is considered best practice for all research."
university-of-lincoln.md,3. Responsibility for research data management through a sound DMP during any research project or programme lies primarily with the researchers.
university-of-lincoln.md,"4. The University will provide training, guidance and support for the development of DMPs or its equivalent and their implementation."
university-of-lincoln.md,"5. Where research data may contain personal information about identifiable individuals, the relevant data protection laws must be considered and a Data Protection Impact"
university-of-lincoln.md,Assessment (DPIA) may need to be conducted in collaboration with the University’s Data Compliance Officer prior to any personal data being collected.
university-of-lincoln.md,6. Researchers should record the existence of research data upon creation or access and deposit it according to their plan. This should be in compliance with timeframes for preserving access that are part of the external contract (often within six months of publication of research findings).
university-of-lincoln.md,7. Research metadata will be published (where appropriate) for permanent citation in the Lincoln Repository alongside conventional outputs such as journal articles and conference papers where appropriate.
university-of-lincoln.md,"8. Access to research data will be granted under appropriate safeguards according to conditions and timeframes specified by researchers, commercial partners and funding bodies."
university-of-lincoln.md,"9. It is the responsibility of the researcher to ensure all research data that support and substantiate published research findings are offered to an appropriate repository for long term storage and public access, where permitted. This may be funder or discipline specific, or, where no external repository has been identified, may be within University storage facilities."
university-of-lincoln.md,"The University aims to provide the infrastructure and expertise for long-term curation, preservation and access to research data. This includes secure services for storage, backup, registration, deposit and retention of research data assets in support of current and future access, during and after completion of research projects."
university-of-lincoln.md,"Costs to meet the specific requirements of Data Management Plans should be included in grant applications, where permitted. The University will develop appropriate plans and budgets for meeting the costs of long-term storage, preservation and curation of research data."

university-of-liverpool.md,## 1. Introduction
university-of-liverpool.md,"1.1 The University of Liverpool recognises that the effective management of research data is an integral part of good research practice. It is essential for data integrity as well as safeguarding and handling data responsibly in accordance with ethical, legal, and regulatory requirements. Good data management underpins research integrity, transparency, and reproducibility by ensuring data associated with research outputs are documented, preserved, and accessible, thereby allowing for the verification of research results."
university-of-liverpool.md,"1.2 Good management also facilitates data sharing which maximises the reuse of research data, the benefits of which include promoting the work of researchers, fostering collaboration, increased resource efficiency, and securing public trust. The University promotes compliance with relevant funder and publisher policies and supports the Concordat on Open Research Data, and UKRI's Common Principles on research data. The University acknowledges there are valid reasons data may not, or cannot, be shared such as where a contract is in place or data are sensitive. The University endorses Horizon Europe's principle that data should be ""as open as possible as closed as necessary"" and follow FAIR Principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable)."
university-of-liverpool.md,## 2. Purpose
university-of-liverpool.md,2.1 The purpose of this policy is to promote good management of research data with the aim of making it openly available where possible so that university research can have the greatest potential impact.
university-of-liverpool.md,"2.2 This policy outlines the expectations and responsibilities of both researchers and the University to support best practice in research data management, the preservation of research data and research related records, and sharing research data."
university-of-liverpool.md,2.3 The aims of this policy are to:
university-of-liverpool.md,1. Promote best practice in research data management together with FAIR Principles to ensure research data are managed in a way that maximises their reproducibility and long-term accessibility.
university-of-liverpool.md,2. Support researchers to make their research data as open as possible in a responsible and timely manner.
university-of-liverpool.md,3. Outline the roles and responsibilities of researchers and the University in supporting good research data management.
university-of-liverpool.md,## 3. Scope
university-of-liverpool.md,3.1 This policy applies to all research regardless of whether it is externally funded and is subject to the provisions of any relevant contracts including funding agreements.
university-of-liverpool.md,"3.2 It applies to all staff, including technical staff, visiting researchers, individuals on honorary contracts, and post graduate research (PGR) students engaged in research, hereafter referred to as researchers."
university-of-liverpool.md,"3.3 Statements 5.3.8, 6.1, 6.3, 6.5 apply to taught course students who have obtained ethical approval and supervisors of those students. However, all students are encouraged to adopt best practice in research data management since all those engaged in academic work have a personal responsibility to contribute to research integrity."
university-of-liverpool.md,"3.3 This policy covers the management of all research data (active and archive data) collected during the course of research regardless of format, and research related records. It also covers the sharing of research data."
university-of-liverpool.md,"3.4 The retention of research related records, records documenting the conduct of research projects, including documents such as protocol, consent procedure, participants and adverse effects arising from research projects, research grant documentation, consent forms, contracts, etc. are covered by the University’s Information Management Policy."
university-of-liverpool.md,## 4. Definitions
university-of-liverpool.md,"For the purposes of this policy, the following terms are defined:"
university-of-liverpool.md,"4.1 Research: Broadly, this is an activity that leads to new insights and knowledge. There are a number of definitions for research, one being the Frascati definition that states “Research and experimental development (R&D) comprise creative work undertaken on a systematic basis in order to increase the stock of knowledge, including knowledge of humankind, culture and society, and the use of this stock of knowledge to devise new applications.”"
university-of-liverpool.md,4.2 Researcher: Any individual who conducts research under the auspices of the University.
university-of-liverpool.md,"4.3 Principal Investigator (PI): A researcher with overall responsibility for a research project. In clinical research where a project has a Chief Investigator (CI) as well as one or more Principal Investigators (PI), the CI has overall responsibility for the research project while each PI has responsibility for an individual recruiting site."
university-of-liverpool.md,"4.4 Research Data: The University adopts the definition laid out in the Concordat on Open Research Data (p.3) which states that “research data are the evidence that underpins the answer to the research question, and can be used to validate findings regardless of form (e.g. print, digital, or physical)1. These might be quantitative information or qualitative statements collected by researchers in the course of their work by experimentation, observation, modelling, interview or other methods, or information derived from existing evidence. Data may be raw or primary (e.g. direct from measurement or collection) or derived from primary data for subsequent analysis or interpretation (e.g. cleaned up or as an extract from a larger data set), or derived from existing sources where the rights may be held by others.”"
university-of-liverpool.md,"4.5 Sponsor: A body that guarantees and oversees a research project or clinical trial, ensuring that there are proper arrangements in place to initiate, manage, monitor and finance a study. A Sponsor can be external to the University."
university-of-liverpool.md,"4.6 Clinical Trials Unit (CTU): An academic specialised research unit with the purpose of designing, conducting, analysing, and publishing clinical trials and other studies. At Liverpool Clinical Trials Centre, the Director of the CTU is typically the data custodian and is responsible for ensuring the proper handling and security of trial data."
university-of-liverpool.md,4.7 Data Controller: The organisation responsible for data security and meeting data protection requirements.
university-of-liverpool.md,4.8 There are three main states of research data:
university-of-liverpool.md,Active data: “Live” project data regularly accessed and/or analysed as part of a research project.
university-of-liverpool.md,"Archive data: End-of-project or finished data. These data are prepared for long-term preservation and archived for legal, regulatory, or contractual purposes. They may contain sensitive or personal information and might not be openly available. Some archive data may also be shared data."
university-of-liverpool.md,Shared data: Research data that are made available for reuse. This may include restrictions or conditions of access and reuse.

university-of-liverpool.md,## 6. Key expectations and guidance
university-of-liverpool.md,### 6.1 Data Management Plans
university-of-liverpool.md,"All research projects are expected to have an associated Data Management Plan (DMP) and clearly document data collection, storage, security, access, ownership, retention, deletion, sharing, and reuse. The DMP should be completed before ethical approval is sought."
university-of-liverpool.md,Guidance and training for DMPs as well as best practice for managing research data throughout the project can be found on the Library’s Research Data Management Essentials web pages. Further support can be sought from the Research Data Management Team.
university-of-liverpool.md,### 6.2 Compliance and contracts
university-of-liverpool.md,"Where a research project is conducted with other institutions or independent researchers, all parties should comply with existing agreements and contracts. Obligations should be documented, and parties should agree a plan for managing the data generated during the study. University of Liverpool researchers are responsible for the management and security of any research data held by the University of Liverpool. For Clinical Trials or Sponsored research where the Clinical Trials Unit or Sponsor is external to the University, the security of any research data is not the formal responsibility of the University of Liverpool. In these cases, responsibility for data security lies with the designated data controller. It is best practice to have e.g. a research contract, collaboration agreement, confidentiality agreement, joint data controllership agreement, and/or data sharing agreement in place before the project begins."
university-of-liverpool.md,Contractual support is provided by the Research Contracts team.
university-of-liverpool.md,### 6.3 Ethical approval
university-of-liverpool.md,Ethical approval must be in place for all relevant research projects before data collection has begun.
university-of-liverpool.md,Researchers can consult the University’s Research Ethics Decision Tool for guidance to determine whether University research ethics approval will be needed for their study.
university-of-liverpool.md,### 6.4 Health and Social Care research
university-of-liverpool.md,Research projects that are being undertaken within the remit of the UK Policy Framework for Health and Social Care Research must have an identified Sponsor before the study can begin. This research also requires review by a Health Research Authority (HRA) Research Ethics Committee (REC). Transfer of research data between the University of Liverpool and partner NHS Trusts must be controlled appropriately and detailed within the protocol and Data Management Plan.
university-of-liverpool.md,The University Sponsorship team can provide advice on such research. Researchers should be aware that access to this data can be requested and requires a written request through the Sponsorship team.
university-of-liverpool.md,### 6.5 Data storage
university-of-liverpool.md,"The University expects all active research data to be stored within University centrally managed IT facilities and services, using University managed devices as per the IT Acceptable Use Policy. Centrally contracted and managed IT facilities and services align with the University’s Data Protection Policy and Information Security Policy."
university-of-liverpool.md,The Information Protection Guide underpins the Information Security Policy and provides support on classifying and protecting information throughout its lifecycle.
university-of-liverpool.md,A list of storage options and guidance for choosing the most appropriate service can be found on the Knowledge Base article Where can I store my research data (KB0012515).
university-of-liverpool.md,"By exception, where University centrally managed storage is deemed not suitable for the research project, the PI should discuss their requirements with relevant subject experts including, but not limited to, Research IT and Information Security via the IT Services self-service portal."
university-of-liverpool.md,"### 6.6 Data ownership, Copyright, and Intellectual Property"
university-of-liverpool.md,"Researchers are expected to be clear about data ownership and/or terms and conditions of use at the beginning of the project (see also section 3.1 of the Information Security Policy). Unless specified by a research funder or other contract, such as in the case of collaborative projects with external organisations or where using third-party or secondary data, data ownership is outlined in the University’s Intellectual Property Policy. Researchers are expected to recognise Intellectual Property (IP) arising from their research activities and manage that Intellectual Property according to any funder requirements, contractual obligations, or in line with the University’s Intellectual Property Policy."
university-of-liverpool.md,Contact the Enterprise Team (internal staff only) for advice on IP related matters.
university-of-liverpool.md,### 6.7 End-of-project
university-of-liverpool.md,"At the end of a research project, an assessment of which data must be retained and which data are destroyed should be undertaken. Data should be disposed of or retained (archived) in accordance with relevant requirements. Where no such funder or other contractual requirements exist, retention should follow the University’s Records Retention Schedule."
university-of-liverpool.md,"Guidance on managing research records, as well as help with various other topics, can be found on the Information and Records Management webpages and via the Information and Records Management Guidance Index (internal staff only and via Microsoft 365). Contact the Information and Records Management team for further support."
university-of-liverpool.md,### 6.8 Open access to research data
university-of-liverpool.md,"Research data should be made openly available with their associated metadata in line with any relevant research funder or publisher policies. Where no policy exists, researchers are encouraged to share data underpinning research publications or of long-term value under the Horizon Europe principle “as open as possible, as closed as necessary”. Data should be shared in an appropriate manner (e.g. anonymised), with as few restrictions as possible, and in a timely manner."
university-of-liverpool.md,Contact the Library’s Research Data Management Team for support and guidance around Open Access to research data.
university-of-liverpool.md,"### 6.9 FAIR data, discoverability, and accessibility"

university-of-nottingham.md,Write 2-3 pages A4
university-of-nottingham.md,### Data description
university-of-nottingham.md,What data will you create?
university-of-nottingham.md,"Data Description: List the kinds of data or major datasets that you expect to create or use, noting its estimated volume/size, content, coverage or scope, and the types of the data (e.g., quantitative, qualitative, survey data, experimental measurements, models, images, audio-visual data, samples, documents, spreadsheets, databases, images, film, digital models, contents of an application, hardcopy records, physical collections or manuscripts, physical samples, or instrumental measurements etc.). Include the raw data arising directly from the research, the reduced data derived from it, and published data. Also, include non-digital data if relevant. Describe the types, volume, and scope of data that will be created and managed in the following terms: quantitative, qualitative, generated from surveys, clinical measurements, interviews, medical records, electronic health records, administrative records, genotypic data, images, tissue samples, etc."
university-of-nottingham.md,"Data volume: It is important to plan for the volume of data you plan to capture, process, and store. Think about the volume of primary and secondary data you will be producing as part of your research. This could be articulated in the anticipated (estimated) number of files you will generate, or the projected storage capacity you expect to require."
university-of-nottingham.md,"Data format: What file formats will you be making use of during your research? Do formats and software enable sharing and long-term validity of data? UKRI and other funders prefer “open” formats to “closed”, proprietary formats, whenever possible. Formats should also be considered to preserve the highest standard of data (so, tiff files would be preferable to compressed jpgs for storing images, for example), and for long-term archival use when possible (e.g. PDF/A, rather than generic PDF, is better suited to long-term archiving). Using propriety formats is acceptable if that is the most appropriate format for your research. State the format of the final dataset. Describe the file formats and software used, the number of records, databases, sweeps, repetitions… (in terms that are meaningful in your field)."
university-of-nottingham.md,### Data collection and/or generation
university-of-nottingham.md,What are your methodologies for data collection / generation? How will you ensure data quality? What data standards will you use?
university-of-nottingham.md,"Describe how you will collect or generate your data and justify why new data collection is needed. Describe good practice and community standards for ensuring new data are of high quality and processing is well documented. How will consistency and quality of data collection / generation be controlled and documented? I.e., through processes of calibration, repeat samples or measurements, standardised data capture or recording, data entry validation, peer review of data or representation with controlled vocabularies?"
university-of-nottingham.md,"Before embarking on a complex project to generate new data, you should assess existing datasets to ensure that nobody has already gathered this data, and that you are aware of similar relevant datasets that already exist. Provide references. [To locate potential datasets of use in your discipline, consult RE3Data.org]. You will need to justify creating new datasets if data relevant to your research is available. Consider how the data you plan to collect or create relates to existing datasets – identify gaps and relationships between currently available and required data."
university-of-nottingham.md,"If purchasing or reusing existing data sources, explain how you address issues such as cost and intellectual property. You should consider the licencing terms to access/re-use data, and what the terms of use are. Give an overview of any contracts or access/use agreements you will have to sign, and any restrictions on how the data might be used and shared."
university-of-nottingham.md,"Methodologies: Outline the proposed methodologies you will use to collect or generate data, including software and tools for data collection, and which community data standards (if any) will be used to ensure the data is of high quality. Provide information on the new data: volume, type, and content. Explain how you will ensure (control and document) data quality and consistency (quality assurance), such as standardised data capture or recording, digitisation, data entry validation, peer review of data, calibration, repeat samples or measurements, representation using controlled vocabularies, use of a uniform interview method to maintain consistency in qualitative data collection, etc. Indicate how the data will be organised during the project, for example, naming conventions, version control, and folder structures."
university-of-nottingham.md,## Ethics and privacy

university-of-nottingham.md,Describe the legal and ethics procedures you will follow.
university-of-nottingham.md,### Ethics and informed consent
university-of-nottingham.md,"Ethical issues may affect how you store data, who can see/use it during collection and in future (data sharing), how long it is kept. You should show that you're aware of this and have planned accordingly. The University's Code of Research Conduct and Research Ethics provides guidance on what types of research will require ethical review. You are responsible for ensuring your handling of all this type of information is secure and complies with the law and associated research ethics procedures. Outline how you will obtain informed consent for the use of personal data as part of the research ethics process and to satisfy the duty of confidentiality towards the individual. The UK Data Service provides excellent guidance in structuring consent forms  that respect legal obligations and facilitate data archiving and publishing."
university-of-nottingham.md,### Data protection
university-of-nottingham.md,If working with personal information you will have legal obligations with regard to data protection. You should provide a short statement around how you will comply with the GDPR/Data Protection Act 2018.
university-of-nottingham.md,"Sample text: ""Personal data will be collected during this project, and the project has considered ethical and legal implications in its data storage, as well as appropriate security of personal data. All participants will agree to data collection and to long-term retention, archiving, and sharing of their anonymised data. Research will follow standard ethical procedures of the Faculty of Arts and the University of Nottingham. Specific aspects will be considered by the Faculty ethics committee as appropriate. In particular, the creation of data from interviews and focus groups will require ethical approval, including consent forms outlining the storage and use for research purposes of data, including access to those data by project researchers and other researchers, both during and after the life of the project. Participants will be informed that they can withdraw their participation at any stage during or after the observations. As we will be working with personal data we will ensure that we comply with the Data Protection Act 2018, including GDPR requirements. This will include providing research participants with the relevant privacy information and ensuring appropriate safeguards for the storage and handling of data are in place."""
university-of-nottingham.md,### Data storage and security

university-of-nottingham.md,"Describe where and how your data will be stored, secured, backed-up and be recovered, and why these choices are appropriate (for security, data maintenance and recovery, and appropriate costs). Describe what devices will be used to capture, process, and store data. Describe back up procedures. When working in the field, describe how you will ensure data is encrypted and securely transferred to a University of Nottingham approved storage solution. You should also describe additional safeguards that you may utilise, such as the anonymisation of personal and sensitive data."
university-of-nottingham.md,"Sample text: ""We will use UoN-provided storage for our working data. UoN licenses Microsoft Teams, allowing for secure and controlled sharing of data among the research team. Microsoft Teams encrypts data both in transit and at rest and is approved against the University’s Handling Restricted Data Policy. The service provides several layers of automatic back up and, in a disaster scenario, files can be recovered. Access to data stored in MS Teams is via secure log-in with multifactor authentication.”"
university-of-nottingham.md,Sample text: “We will use UoN Central Performance Storage for our working data. This storage is specifically designed to be used for high throughput data or large file sizes. The storage is onpremise and approved against the University’s Handling Restricted Data Policy.

university-of-nottingham.md,"### Data management, documentation and curation"
university-of-nottingham.md,"What are your principles, systems, and major standards for data management and creation? What metadata and documentation will you keep?"
university-of-nottingham.md,"Data documentation: Highlight what sort of documentation you intend to provide, including what software and processes/protocols will be required to understand, reuse, and validate the datasets. For example, descriptions of data that enable research data to be used by others outside of your own team. This may include documenting the methods used to generate the data, analytical and procedural information, capturing instrument metadata alongside data, documenting provenance of data and their coding, detailed descriptions for variables, records, etc."
university-of-nottingham.md,"Metadata: When depositing data, repositories will usually require descriptive metadata that describes the data in detail: typically, a title, a brief description of the dataset, and the creator(s) of the data. Provide an overview of what metadata you will provide in order to facilitate discoverability and use of the data. There are various metadata standards which can help you to describe your data in a consistent way, and individual data repositories will advise on the relevant standards. You should provide as much information as you are able to. As an example of the kind of information requested, please see our guide for depositing data within the University of Nottingham's data repository."
university-of-nottingham.md,"Sample text: ""We shall record and provide documentation via a README file that will describe:"
university-of-nottingham.md,"our research aims, objectives and hypotheses;"

university-of-nottingham.md,### Data preservation
university-of-nottingham.md,How will you ensure the long-term storage and preservation of data?
university-of-nottingham.md,"Outline how you will ensure data is stored long-term: state where you will deposit your data (your nominated data centre or repository), and how long it will be preserved for. Some research funders and regulators specify how long data should be retained for. Where this is articulated, you should describe how you will meet this requirement (i.e., selecting an appropriate repository that guarantees preservation for a minimum period). In all other circumstances, the University expects data to be retained for a minimum of 7 years. Outline what data you will retain. Not all data will be suitable for retention, but some data will be mandated for retention. Identify any data repository (- ies) that are, or will be, entrusted with storing, curating and/or sharing data from your study, where they exist for particular disciplinary domains or data types. Most funders recommend that data underpinning"
university-of-nottingham.md,"research outputs should be deposited in an established data repository that specialises in retention, preservation, and publication of data. When choosing a repository, you should consider:"
university-of-nottingham.md,Are the repository’s terms and conditions acceptable and do they align with funder requirements?
university-of-nottingham.md,"Will support for access or curation be needed from the data centre that exceeds the norm, and has this been planned for/ costed?"
university-of-nottingham.md,Where is your data going to be stored and does this meet legal or ethical obligations such as compliance with the GDPR?
university-of-nottingham.md,"Will your dataset be given a permanent identifier, such as a DOI, so that the link to your data will stay the same even if the web URLs change?"
university-of-nottingham.md,Is the repository used by researchers in your discipline? Does the repository already have a good reputation in your field and is it recommended by your funder or your journal?
university-of-nottingham.md,"Does the repository allow you to describe your data sufficiently, so it is easy to find and easy to cite?"
university-of-nottingham.md,Is the repository established and well-funded so that you can rely on it still preserving your data in 10 years’ time?
university-of-nottingham.md,"In your data management plan, you should state where your data will be deposited for long term preservation, and identify any costs associated with storing and making your research data available online."
university-of-nottingham.md,"If a data centre exists for your specific discipline, then it is usually recommended to choose this option. Some funders mandate deposit in a specific repository, for example, ESRC data must be deposited with the UK Data Service within 3 months of project end; NERC has a network of environmental data centres to provide a similar job for research it funds. See the NERC Data Centre or the ESRC-supported UK Data Service. You can check if a repository exists for your discipline by searching the re3data.org Registry of research data repositories."
university-of-nottingham.md,"If there is no established data repository available for your discipline or funder, the University of Nottingham also has its own Research Data repository, which issues a DOI (Digital Object Identifier) for each dataset deposited so that it can be easily cited. The repository can be used to either deposit a closed (private) dataset, publish data openly, or under controlled access restrictions. The repository will provide access to your data in line with your funder's retention period."
university-of-nottingham.md,"Sample text: “All anonymised research data created by the project will be deposited in the UoN research data archive (  UoN will retain and preserve research data in line with UoN and [insert your funder's name] requirements for a minimum of 7 [or insert your funder's minimum retention requirement if longer] years, but data will be retained for longer periods of time where it is of continual value to users"

university-of-nottingham.md,"## Data sharing, publication and access"
university-of-nottingham.md,How will the data generated be shared and published?
university-of-nottingham.md,"Describe what data will be suitable for sharing and how this will be achieved (through a data repository, or a description of the data in a data journal). Indicate how potential new users (outside of your organisation) can find out about your data. Indicate whether the data will be deposited in and available from an identified community database, repository, archive or other infrastructure established to curate and share data. If the data will be suitable for controlled access, identify who makes or will make the decision on whether to supply the data to a potential new user. Indicate whether external users are (will be) bound by data sharing agreements, setting out their main responsibilities. If the data will not be suitable for sharing, justify why this is the case. If you do not wish to share the data for a limited, defined period of exclusive use of data for primary research, show how this restriction on sharing is based on simple, clear principles. What are the timescale/dependencies for when data will be accessible to others outside of your team? Summarize the principles of your current/intended policy. Indicate whether your policy or approach to data sharing is (or will be) published on your study website (or by other means)."
university-of-nottingham.md,"Outline the way(s) in which your data will be shared (e.g., DOI), and/or any justification for why this is not possible. How will data be shared, and what is its value to others? State the timeline for public release of data and the mechanism to achieve this. The preferred way to share data is by depositing it with data repositories who will either publish it openly online, or offer some form of controlled access. You can also publish a description of your dataset in a data journal. You will need to include a data access statement in published outputs or final reports referencing your DOI, or, where and how data can be accessed."
university-of-nottingham.md,"Will the data be open, or will you charge to access it? Justify if charging."
university-of-nottingham.md,How will you license the data?
university-of-nottingham.md,"How will you ensure that your data is Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Re-usable?"
university-of-nottingham.md,"State when you intend to share or release your data, including any planned embargo period and the justification for this. Some communities have established timeframes for releasing data. These disciplinary guidelines, if they exist, should be referenced in the DMP. State any restrictions or delays to sharing, with planned actions to limit such restrictions. For most funders, a limited and defined period of exclusive use is acceptable (embargoes). This may be for reasons such as to avoid compromising research results by premature sharing, or to allow for the filing of patent applications."
university-of-nottingham.md,"It is also acknowledged that not all data can or should be 'open' and so publishing and sharing data may need to be restricted, for example:"
university-of-nottingham.md,legal requirements – if your data includes personal information subject to the Data
university-of-nottingham.md,Protection Act 2018 and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
university-of-nottingham.md,ethical concerns – if your data includes personal or confidential data where no consent for sharing has been given.
university-of-nottingham.md,licence restrictions – if you are using data owned by third parties and don’t have the rights to share.
university-of-nottingham.md,"If you believe your data will require controlled access state this here. Details of the managed access process should be provided, including if a Data Sharing Agreement will be completed for each data request. If you expect obstacles to sharing your data, explain which and the possible measures you can apply to overcome these. Make explicit mention of the planned procedures to handle consent for data sharing for data obtained from human participants, and/or how to anonymise data, to make sure that data can be made available and accessible for future scientific research."
university-of-nottingham.md,"Sample text: "" All data for which consent to share has been obtained will be shared via the University of Nottingham data archive under a CC-BY license. Any data which is deemed to be personally or commercially sensitive will assessed on a case-by-case basis to determine whether it can be shared. There will be no need to update the data past the project period. All published outputs will contain a Data Availability Statement including the datacite DOI that directs to the relevant data set. Data will be released at the same time as any published outputs underpinned by the data or by one year from the end of the project."""
university-of-nottingham.md,"Sample text: ""The anonymised data (transcripts and questionnaires) will be deposited in the University of Nottingham data archive once all data has been gathered, anonymised, and cleansed [in line with the timelines mandated by my funder for the timely deposit of data].

university-of-portsmouth.md,## Summary
university-of-portsmouth.md,What is this document about?
university-of-portsmouth.md,"Research Data Management, including archiving, long-term preservation and open access."
university-of-portsmouth.md,### Who is this for?
university-of-portsmouth.md,This policy applies to all University of Portsmouth research.
university-of-portsmouth.md,### How does the University check this is followed?
university-of-portsmouth.md,Research publications produced by University of Portsmouth researchers must be registered with the Pure online system in order for them to be eligible for the next Research Excellence Framework (REF). The Library systematically checks whether the underlying research data set/s related to these publications have also been made open access. They contact the authors if a data availability statement (or equivalent) and/or the data set/s appear to be missing.
university-of-portsmouth.md,### Who can you contact if you have any queries about this document?
university-of-portsmouth.md,"Research Data Officer - Gary Pike, researchdata@port.ac.uk"
university-of-portsmouth.md,### Executive summary
university-of-portsmouth.md,The Research Data Management (RDM) Policy sets out the University's expectations for staff when managing research data. The main points of the policy are:
university-of-portsmouth.md,"- that appropriate RDM planning takes place,"
university-of-portsmouth.md,"- Data Availability Statements (or equivalent text) are included for all research outputs, - a new UoP Research Data Archive has been set up to preserve data centrally, - that data sharing be enabled whenever possible."
university-of-portsmouth.md,## Research Data Management Policy: A Summary
university-of-portsmouth.md,### Introduction
university-of-portsmouth.md,"Given current trends in data management practices, the process of data management is becoming increasingly important. Whilst this is placing increased burdens on academic research, it also offers additional opportunities for demonstration of best practice and research environment both for the University and also for the individual."
university-of-portsmouth.md,"For example, where applicable, making data openly and publicly available offers the potential to demonstrate additional impact from the research, on the wider academic community and also beyond. As the activity of data management becomes more important this will also become more explicitly recognised in Performance Development Reviews (PDRs), annual research reviews and annual PhD reviews."
university-of-portsmouth.md,"In addition to helping demonstrate good practice in terms of research design, it is also recognised in the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA) that the value of and impact of all research outputs including datasets and software as well as publications should be acknowledged."
university-of-portsmouth.md,### Overview of Key Policy Points
university-of-portsmouth.md,"a. There is now a need to include a Data Availability Statement (or equivalent wording/information in a data/methods/acknowledgement section) in all papers, whether or not the journals require them."
university-of-portsmouth.md,"b. Data sharing where possible/applicable is a requirement for data held by UoP. The minimum requirement is metadata necessary for reproduction of research results, with the best practice recommendation being making research data publicly and openly available to maximise the benefit for the academic and the institution. Depending on the subject area a publication in a data journal describing a dataset may be appropriate."
university-of-portsmouth.md,c. Data deposition information must be made discoverable in Pure if the data are deposited externally.
university-of-portsmouth.md,### Definitions
university-of-portsmouth.md,"For the purpose of this Policy, these terms are defined as follows:"
university-of-portsmouth.md,"A ‘Data Management Plan’ (DMP) typically states what research data are likely to be created as a result of certain research activities and outlines the plans for data collection, storage, processing, preservation, sharing/dissemination, and eventual (possible) destruction of such research data. A DMP might take the form of a stand-alone document or be part of a research funding application or research design protocol (for ethical review). It should be considered a living document, subject to necessary changes, for the duration of a project. For simple projects a DMP will likely be brief. For more complex projects it may act as an overview or index document for all the necessary DM processes."
university-of-portsmouth.md,"Open Access’ (OA) means that research data are made available such that they can be accessed and used by the general public and other organisations, without cost to the user."
university-of-portsmouth.md,"The ‘UoP Data Steward’ is the most senior University of Portsmouth Researcher (staff member) associated with the research data (but not necessarily responsible for the OA requirements). The Data Steward should be identified in the DMP. This is typically the Principal Investigator (PI) or, for a larger body of research work, it may be the Research Lead (e.g. Professor of the research team), or in the case of postgraduate research student (PGRS) projects it is typically their (First) Supervisor. In terms of the consequent data management responsibilities:"
university-of-portsmouth.md,"a. If you, as a UoP employee, are the holder of the data, then you must hold the data in OA accessible format and are responsible for the data for data management purposes"
university-of-portsmouth.md,"b. If you (as the UoP academic) are the corresponding author for published work, then you either must hold the data (in OA accessible format) yourself, or have a formal agreement with the holder of the data to be able to access it for data management purposes."
university-of-portsmouth.md,"c. If you are neither the corresponding author nor have agreed access to data for DM purposes, then you are not responsible for the DM OA requirement."
university-of-portsmouth.md,"d. If you are the UoP Data Steward because of your role as the First Supervisor of a PGRS, the Data Steward role is to promote good research practice and, in consultation with the PGR, endeavour to ensure that the relevant policies and processes (UoP/funders/other external) are followed by the PGRS (e.g. as demonstrated at major and annual review)."
university-of-portsmouth.md,"The ‘Regulatory Environment’ includes all applicable legislation, contractual or funder obligations, and ethics and other policy requirements. Examples of items to be considered within the regulatory environment include – but are not limited to – the following:"
university-of-portsmouth.md,"Legislative: Data Protection Act 2018, UK GDPR and the EU GDPR, as well as the Freedom of Information Act 2000."
university-of-portsmouth.md,"Contractual: Funding terms and conditions, collaboration agreements (e.g. with external"
university-of-portsmouth.md,"companies or other institutions), third party licenses (e.g. when reusing data generated elsewhere), material transfer agreements, confidentiality agreements, and studentship agreements."
university-of-portsmouth.md,"Ethical: Ethical review procedures, and participant consents. (See Related Guidance Resources section.)"
university-of-portsmouth.md,Policies: University policies (see Related Policies section) and relevant funder/collaborator policies.
university-of-portsmouth.md,University of Portsmouth | Research Data Management Policy October 2021 | 6 of 11
university-of-portsmouth.md,"It also includes the UK Research Integrity Office’s (UKRIO) Code of Practice for Research, which has been adopted by the University, and the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA), of which the University is a signatory."
university-of-portsmouth.md,‘Research’ (in accordance with the Research Excellence Framework (REF) 2014 definition) means a process of investigation leading to new insights.
university-of-portsmouth.md,"It includes work of direct relevance to the needs of commerce, industry, and to the public and volunteer sectors; scholarship; the invention and generation of ideas, images, performances, artefacts including design, where these lead to new or substantially improved insights; and the use of existing knowledge in experimental development to produce new or substantially improved materials, devices, products and processes, including design and construction."
university-of-portsmouth.md,"It excludes routine testing and routine analysis of materials, components and processes such as for the maintenance of national standards, as distinct from the development of new analytical techniques. It also excludes the development of teaching materials that do not embody original research."
university-of-portsmouth.md,"‘Research Data’ are information created or collected in pursuit of research activities, which may be in digital or physical formats. All subject areas and disciplines have research data."
university-of-portsmouth.md,"This includes all data that has been collated and transformed (e.g. placed in databases for analysis), and in general all data and metadata upon which the process of research has actively impinged and is necessary for reproduction of the research activity."
university-of-portsmouth.md,"This includes all definitive records of information collected from and about living human subjects\*, all experimental and survey results data, all records of relevant ephemeral events (performances, exhibits, etc)."
university-of-portsmouth.md,"\*NB: To enable the sharing of research data involving personal data, such data (as applicable) should be anonymised, either at the point of collection or as part of the processing. The GDPR/DPA2018 does not apply to anonymised data or data once anonymised, but does apply to the process of anonymisation, and therefore consent to the anonymisation of their data should still be obtained from participants."
university-of-portsmouth.md,"It excludes research notes (except when these are the primary location of types of data defined above), transcriptions of information that remains accessible elsewhere in a digital format, and in general any records of information that would be accessible to a third party by following information provided in footnotes or references to the published research."
university-of-portsmouth.md,## The Policy
university-of-portsmouth.md,### 1. What does this Policy apply to?
university-of-portsmouth.md,This Policy applies to all University of Portsmouth research.
university-of-portsmouth.md,### 2. Responsibility:
university-of-portsmouth.md,The UoP Data Steward is ultimately responsible for the management of UoP-held research data throughout all stages of research.
university-of-portsmouth.md,### 3. Regulatory Environment:
university-of-portsmouth.md,The Data Steward is responsible for ensuring that the research adheres to all applicable requirements and conditions imposed by the Regulatory Environment.
university-of-portsmouth.md,### 4. Planning:
university-of-portsmouth.md,The Data Steward must ensure that research data management planning takes place. This typically involves making a Data Management Plan.
university-of-portsmouth.md,### 5. Costs:
university-of-portsmouth.md,"Where possible, the Data Steward must seek to recover the direct costs of managing research data from an external research funder."
university-of-portsmouth.md,"When the research project is not externally funded it is acknowledged that there is an opportunity cost to data management activities. It is hoped, however, that these will be counterbalanced by the opportunities to demonstrate good research practice that will be created (e.g. in terms of additional data citations and data journal publications) and that such activity will become more explicitly recognised in PDRs and annual research reviews etc. (e.g. through the inclusion of evaluation of the quality of publications in data journals when assessing research workload allowances)."
university-of-portsmouth.md,### 6. Active Research Data:
university-of-portsmouth.md,"The UoP Data Steward must ensure that ‘active’ research data held by UoP are stored securely and protected from loss, unlawful or unethical access, and in accordance with all other applicable requirements of the Regulatory Environment."
university-of-portsmouth.md,### 7. Data Availability Statements and Publications:
university-of-portsmouth.md,"The Data Steward must ensure that a statement describing research data availability is included in research publications and other relevant outputs. It is recognised that some journals do not have dedicated sections for statements, so as a minimum it may be necessary to include equivalent text in a data/methods section (most obviously), acknowledgments section, footnotes or their equivalents."
university-of-portsmouth.md,Data Availability Statement types (sometimes also referred to as Data Access Statements or similar variations):
university-of-portsmouth.md,i) There are no new data.
university-of-portsmouth.md,ii) The data or references/link to secondary datasets are contained within the paper itself.
university-of-portsmouth.md,"iii) The data (and how to access them) are available, for example by providing a DOI link or repository information for physical samples."
university-of-portsmouth.md,For best practice it is suggested that supplementary information be allocated a DOI and linked in the data statement. This practice gets around the issue of supplementary information being trapped behind a subscription paywall when only the post-print is accessible via the Green OA route. A data paper published in a data journal may also be appropriate for some datasets.
university-of-portsmouth.md,"University of Portsmouth | Research Data Management Policy October 2021 | 8 of 11 iv) Data are available, but access is restricted: state the reason(s) for the restriction and how access can be obtained1."
university-of-portsmouth.md,(Key Policy Point A)
university-of-portsmouth.md,### 8. Archived Research Data:
university-of-portsmouth.md,"i) The Data Steward must ensure that research data held by UoP are archived for long-term preservation and (as far as possible) made OA if they substantiate published research findings, are of potential long-term value, and/or retention is a requirement of the Regulatory Environment. (Key Policy Point B)"
university-of-portsmouth.md,"ii) When making such research data OA, the Data Steward must ensure the research data (e.g. files) are stored in either an established subject specific repository or in the University’s own research data repository."
university-of-portsmouth.md,"iii) When making such research data open access, the Data Steward must ensure that data are discoverable from the University’s own online research data repository, regardless of whether the research data themselves (e.g.files) are stored in the University’s repository or elsewhere. (A DOI will be allocated for dataset entries validated in Pure.) (Key Policy Point C)"
university-of-portsmouth.md,"iv) When making research data OA, the Data Steward must ensure that such research data are assigned a license that enables the data to be reused and shared by others under as permissible terms as the Regulatory Environment will allow."
university-of-portsmouth.md,"v) The Data Steward must ensure that such research data are made discoverable and accessible with first publication of research findings based on the research data, or within 12 months of project completion, whichever is sooner."
university-of-portsmouth.md,"vi) Unless the applicable Regulatory Environment specifies otherwise, such research data must be retained for a minimum of ten years in accordance with the University’s Retention Policy and schedule."
university-of-portsmouth.md,vii) For staff leaving the University who need to archive research datasets please contact researchdata@port.ac.uk.

university-of-potsdam.md,"Non-official translation of the policy ratified by Senate on September 25, 2019 and published in Amtliche Bekanntmachungen ""Official Notices"" Nr. 18 of September 30, 2019, pp. 1361-1362. The information regarding the novel DFG Code of Conduct in footnote 3 has been added editorially."
university-of-potsdam.md,"The University of Potsdam, as Brandenburg’s largest university, is oriented towards distinctive interdisciplinary research profiles in cooperation with a large number of non-university research institutions in the natural and human sciences, the humanities, and the social sciences. In many of these areas, data are an essential basis of scientific knowledge; since 2019, data-centric sciences have been designated as one of four focus areas for research at the University of Potsdam."
university-of-potsdam.md,"Research data can be the foundation for further research as well as the transfer of knowledge and technology, including for purposes beyond those for which the data were collected. Therefore, publishing and archiving research data serve not only for the replicability and verification of earlier results but also for the finding of new results. Recent developments in good scientific practice have given rise to new requirements regarding the handling of research data. Moreover, the digital transformation in academia confronts researchers and research support staff with challenges regarding capabilities and infrastructural prerequisites for research data management. Making data publishing and research data management a self-evident part of research practice will require cultural changes."
university-of-potsdam.md,"This policy governs the handling of data that is generated, reused, or processed as part of the research methods for research projects. This includes the methods and test procedures available as data, such as questionnaires or software. It also serves to implement the “Principles for Handling of Research Data” by the Alliance of Science Organisations in Germany1 and the “Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities” signed by the University of Potsdam in 20152."
university-of-potsdam.md,This policy applies to all researchers and research support staff at the University of Potsdam. The University of Potsdam will publish recommendations on how researchers and research support staff can comply with the requirements of this policy.
university-of-potsdam.md,### I. Principles
university-of-potsdam.md,"(1) The University of Potsdam is committed to free access to research data. Research data should be made available for reuse as openly as possible, unless interests worthy of protection predominate or legal requirements prevent their publication. Research data that constitute the basis of published results should be made accessible promptly and linked to the publication appropriately. Research data with high reuse potential should be published in a quality-assured manner regardless of their use for a text publication. In order to improve reproducibility and to acknowledge underlying academic achievements, reused data and research software should be cited."
university-of-potsdam.md,"(2)	 The University of Potsdam ensures the archiving of research data. Research data that constitute the basis of a text publication but are not themselves published are to be archived for at least 10 years using a suitable infrastructure. Storage of research data exclusively by the researchers themselves or the immediate deletion of the data are permissible only if interests worthy of protection predominate or legal requirements stipulate this, or in case no suitable infrastructure for archiving these data is available."
university-of-potsdam.md,(3) The University of Potsdam recognizes the preparation of research data for reuse and the development of reusable research software as academic achievements. The same applies to contributions to the advancement of discipline-specific good practice in the handling of research data and research software. The research output of the University of Potsdam includes quality-assured data and software publications that are recognized by the respective scientific community.
university-of-potsdam.md,(4)	 All researchers are responsible for complying with good scientific practice regarding the handling of research data. The relevant discipline-specific guidelines by DFG review boards and academic associations on the handling of research data are to be taken into account. The following people bear special responsibility:
university-of-potsdam.md,"1. Principle investigators, in particular with regard to a project’s documentation, openness, and reusability of research data as well as data protection."
university-of-potsdam.md,"2. Research group leaders with regard to cross-project aspects of data handling (e.g., using common standards for the quality and storage of comparable data from several studies)."
university-of-potsdam.md,"(5) Research students and early career researchers are entitled to appropriate information, qualification, and support from teaching staff and supervisors. In disciplines working with data, basics of the practical handling of research data should be taught as comprehensive course content, starting at the undergraduate level. Opportunities for postgraduate training should be created for young scientists, lecturers, and supervisors."
university-of-potsdam.md,### II.	 Legal Framework
university-of-potsdam.md,(1)	 Legally binding regulations on the handling of research data remain unaffected and take precedence over this policy.
university-of-potsdam.md,"(2)	 Examples of legal and university regulations which result in rights and obligations with regard to research data are: 1. Regeln zur Sicherung guter wissenschaftlicher Praxis an der Universität Potsdam “Rules for Good Scientific Practice at the University of Potsdam”,3 2. Verfahrensordnung der Ethikkommission der Universität Potsdam “Rules of Procedure of the Ethics Committee of the University of Potsdam”,4 3. fundamental rights, in particular privacy rights, including data protection,5"
university-of-potsdam.md,"4.	 intellectual property rights (copyright and related rights as well as patent law and related commercial rights, including regulations regarding employee inventions)."
university-of-potsdam.md,"(3) Further binding regulations may result from agreements, e.g., in grant, cooperation, and license contracts. In particular, the requirements of funding bodies for the management, publishing, and archiving of research data must be met. Any restrictions on the openness and reusability of research data through contracts and other agreements that contravene the principles of this policy are to be avoided."
university-of-potsdam.md,### III.	 Institutional Responsibility
university-of-potsdam.md,"(1)	 As part of its research data strategy, the University of Potsdam commits itself to create the technical and organizational preconditions that enable compliance with this policy."
university-of-potsdam.md,"(2)	 The University of Potsdam initiates a cross-faculty discussion and development process on open science and the digital transformation in research, as well as on data handling competence training in teaching for degree courses and in postgraduate training."
university-of-potsdam.md,"(3)	 The University of Potsdam supports declarations and initiatives at the state, federal, European, and international levels that promote free access to research data, the recognition of data and software publications as research output, good practice in research data management, and good conditions for data-intensive research."
university-of-potsdam.md,(4)	 The activities of the University of Potsdam in the field of research data take gender and diversity aspects into account.
university-of-potsdam.md,### IV. Validity
university-of-potsdam.md,(1)	 This policy shall enter into force after the day of its publication in Amtliche Bekanntmachungen “Official Notices” of the University of Potsdam.
university-of-potsdam.md,"(2)	 It will be reviewed together with the associated research data strategy of the University of Potsdam when necessary, but no later than in 2023."
university-of-potsdam.md,## Recommendations for the Handling of Research Data at the University of Potsdam
university-of-potsdam.md,"Non-official translation of the recommendations adopted by Senate’s Commission for Research and Junior Academics (FNK) on June 26, 2019, duly noted by Senate on September 25, 2019, with changes adopted by FNK on October 9, 2019 to match the requirements of the novel DFG Code of Conduct Guidelines for Safeguarding Good Research Practice."
university-of-potsdam.md,These recommendations specify and complement the Research Data Policy of University of Potsdam. They are aimed at all researchers and research support staff.
university-of-potsdam.md,### I. Working with Research Data
university-of-potsdam.md,"The requirements of good scientific practice regarding honest, methodologically correct, thorough, reliable, and replicable work through good documentation also apply to the handling of research data. Principle overarching elements of secure and well-documented work with research data are listed below. For the planning and structured documentation of these elements it is recommended to use data management plans (DMP) as instruments for project and quality management and to update them regularly. DMP can be created at the level of a project, a data-intensive research instrument, or a working group, as needed. In the case of projects which pose an exceptional burden on centrally-operated infrastructure, central facilities may require the submission of a DMP."
university-of-potsdam.md,"1. Purpose of the data. It is recommended to determine at an early stage which data will be published or archived and which data will continue to be stored by the researchers themselves. It is useful to define holding periods. Data that are no longer needed, nor worth publishing or archiving, should be deleted regularly. In particular, personal data are subject to the principle of storage limitation: storage is only permitted as long as strictly necessary for the respective purpose. Therefore, research data that contains personally identifyable information must be anonymized as soon as possible according to the research purpose.1"
university-of-potsdam.md,"2. Intellectual property. Research data usually is not covered by copyright or related intellectual property rights, but in certain cases multiple rights may accrue to different persons. Ownership and usage rights of research data are therefore often unclear, which can limit its reuse. For each pro ject with multiple participants it is therefore recommended to document at an early stage which rights may have accrued to whom, the intention to publish the data, and the reciprocal granting of the relevant usage rights."
university-of-potsdam.md,"3. Secure storage. Data loss is to be prevented through the use of suitable storage services or of storage media and appropriate backups. The use of storage services run by the scientific community is recommended; the use of local storage media and of commercial storage services as a private customer is discouraged. In many cases version-control is helpful. The necessary level of data security is to be ensured by appropriate technical and organizational measures, e.g. effective access restrictions and pseudonymization of personal data that cannot be fully anonymized."
university-of-potsdam.md,"4. Documentation and use of standards. To make data reusable it is necessary to document the context in which the data was created and the tools used for data processing. For the sake of interoperability and long-term readability, the use of appropriate file formats is recommended with preference given to formats using open standards. To further reproducibility it is recommended to define and document conventions for fle names and folder hierarchies early on; to use suitable, and when possible subject-specific metadata standards; and to collect relevant metadata already during the research process."
university-of-potsdam.md,### II. Publication and Citation of Research Data
university-of-potsdam.md,"The rules of good scientific practice for publishing also apply to data and software publications. In particular, it is prohibited to withhold data that does not support the authors’ hypotheses, to fragment data and software publications with the aim of increasing the number of publications, or to duplicate publications without disclosing the previous publication. The following points provide further guidance regarding the publication and citation of research data."
university-of-potsdam.md,"1. Place of publication. For the publication of research data, well-established discipline- or data-type-specific databases, repositories, and data centers should be preferred. Infrastructures should be used in which data are kept and can be referenced independently; research data should not exclusively be provided with the text publication as supplementary material."
university-of-potsdam.md,"2. Preparation and availability of data. Research data should be made accessible in a processing stage (raw or structured data) that enables meaningful reuse by third parties. It is recommended to strive for consistent adherence to the FAIR data principles (findable, accessible, interoper able, and reusable) when preparing data for publication and selecting the place of publication.2 The four principles articulate the following basic requirements:"
university-of-potsdam.md,"a. Findability: The data is sufficiently described with relevant metadata and referenced by a unique persistent identifier (e.g., a DOI)."
university-of-potsdam.md,b. Accessibility: The data is readable by both humans and machines and is stored in a trusted repository.
university-of-potsdam.md,"c. Interoperability: Data and metadata use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable vocabulary for knowledge representation."
university-of-potsdam.md,"d. Reusability: The data is unambiguously licensed, contains correct provenance information, and is well documented.3"
university-of-potsdam.md,"Self-programmed research software should be made publicly available as source code. Source code of published software should be persistent, citable, and documented.4"
university-of-potsdam.md,"3. Authorship. A person who makes a genuine, accountable contribution to the content of academic data or software publication is an author. Such a contribution is established especially through substantial research-based involvement in the creation, collection, acquisition, or provision of the data, software, or sources.5"
university-of-potsdam.md,"4. Free licensing and open access. Research data and scientific software should be made available under established, standardized and, as far as possible, free and open licenses. Access conditions and, if applicable, embargo periods should adhere to the principle of “as open as possible, as closed as necessary”. The following points provide specific guidance for licensing:"
university-of-potsdam.md,a. Licensing and attribution: The obligation to attribute academic achievements is a principle of good scientific practice. Licenses and waivers for data and software that do not contractually require the attribution of the authors do not supersede this obligation. The preferred way to promote data and software citation is not through restrictive licensing but by including a recommended citation.
university-of-potsdam.md,"b. Public research data: Creative Commons tools have become the most common way to license research data that is made publicly available. Data that is free of copyright and related rights should be labelled as such upon release using the “Creative Commons Zero” (CC0) waiver. For data that is protected by copyright or related rights, using the CC0 waiver is also recommended because it is the best way to ensure reusability. The license “Creative Commons Attribution” (CC BY) can also be considered, but due to the strict formal requirements regarding attribution and the provision of license information it already limits subsequent use. Creative Commons licenses with terms that go beyond the “Attribution” element are not suitable for licensing research data (“Non-Commercial”, NC; “No Derivative Works”, ND), or are suitable only in certain cases and only to a limited extent (“Sharing under Equal Conditions”, SA).6"
university-of-potsdam.md,c. Research data for “Scientific Use” only: Research data to which access has to be restricted should be licensed in consultation with the approriate data center using the licenses recommended by them.
university-of-potsdam.md,d. Software: Creative Commons licenses (such as CC BY) are not suitable for software. A CC0 waiver can be granted for completely selfwritten code (to which the programmers own all rights). This is especially useful for short scripts. Free software licenses should be used for more complex products. Examples of common free software licenses are the MIT license and the GNU GPLv3.7
university-of-potsdam.md,5. Registration of research output. Quality-assured data and software publications that are recognized by the respective scientific community and can be referenced independently should be reported to the University Library by the authors for inclusion in the University Bibliography.
university-of-potsdam.md,"6. Citation of data and software. If no subject-specific standards have been established yet for the citation of data and software and if no guidelines by the journal or the publisher are available, it is recommended to refer to the Data Citation Principles.8"
university-of-potsdam.md,### III.	 Contracts and Cooperations
university-of-potsdam.md,"1. When negotiating grant agreements, in particular with private sponsors, cooperation agreements, and license agreements, researchers and research support staff should ensure that these agreements observe the principles of the Research Data Policy of the University of Potsdam as much as possible, in particular with regard to the openness and reusability of research data. When transferring rights for reuse, publication, or commercial utilization, care should be taken to ensure that the data remain freely available for scientific purposes, and in particular that no exclusive rights are granted to commercial actors."
university-of-potsdam.md,"2. Cross-institutional research cooperations should align their practices with the Research Data Policy of the University of Potsdam, unless other parties mandate equivalent or stricter requirements. Within the framework of their governance, institutionalised cooperations like clusters and networks should establish clear and binding regulations on joint data management as well as on the openness and usability of their research data at an early stage."
university-of-potsdam.md,### IV.	 Institutional Responsibility
university-of-potsdam.md,"1. All faculties are advised to consider whether qualification theses should contain statements on data availability in the future and, if so, to set up regulations with an appropriate degree of bindingness."
university-of-potsdam.md,2. The study commissions are advised to reassess curricula to ensure appropriate consideration of the practical handling of research data as comprehensive course content in undergraduate and consecutive Masters programs.
university-of-potsdam.md,3. Departments and research groups are advised to appoint research data contacts to enable institutional archiving of the research data at the University of Potsdam.

university-of-potsdam_cropped.md,## Research Data Policy of the University of Potsdam
university-of-potsdam_cropped.md,"Non-official translation of the policy ratified by Senate on September 25, 2019 and published in Amtliche Bekanntmachungen ""Official Notices"" Nr. 18 of September 30, 2019, pp. 1361-1362. The information regarding the novel DFG Code of Conduct in footnote 3 has been added editorially."
university-of-potsdam_cropped.md,"The University of Potsdam, as Brandenburg’s largest university, is oriented towards distinctive interdisciplinary research profiles in cooperation with a large number of non-university research institutions in the natural and human sciences, the humanities, and the social sciences. In many of these areas, data are an essential basis of scientific knowledge; since 2019, data-centric sciences have been designated as one of four focus areas for research at the University of Potsdam."
university-of-potsdam_cropped.md,"Research data can be the foundation for further research as well as the transfer of knowledge and technology, including for purposes beyond those for which the data were collected. Therefore, publishing and archiving research data serve not only for the replicability and verification of earlier results but also for the finding of new results. Recent developments in good scientific practice have given rise to new requirements regarding the handling of research data. Moreover, the digital transformation in academia confronts researchers and research support staff with challenges regarding capabilities and infrastructural prerequisites for research data management. Making data publishing and research data management a self-evident part of research practice will require cultural changes."
university-of-potsdam_cropped.md,"This policy governs the handling of data that is generated, reused, or processed as part of the research methods for research projects. This includes the methods and test procedures available as data, such as questionnaires or software. It also serves to implement the “Principles for Handling of Research Data” by the Alliance of Science Organisations in Germany1 and the “Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities” signed by the University of Potsdam in 20152."
university-of-potsdam_cropped.md,This policy applies to all researchers and research support staff at the University of Potsdam. The University of Potsdam will publish recommendations on how researchers and research support staff can comply with the requirements of this policy.
university-of-potsdam_cropped.md,### I. Principles
university-of-potsdam_cropped.md,"(1) The University of Potsdam is committed to free access to research data. Research data should be made available for reuse as openly as possible, unless interests worthy of protection predominate or legal requirements prevent their publication. Research data that constitute the basis of published results should be made accessible promptly and linked to the publication appropriately. Research data with high reuse potential should be published in a quality-assured manner regardless of their use for a text publication. In order to improve reproducibility and to acknowledge underlying academic achievements, reused data and research software should be cited."
university-of-potsdam_cropped.md,"(2)	 The University of Potsdam ensures the archiving of research data. Research data that constitute the basis of a text publication but are not themselves published are to be archived for at least 10 years using a suitable infrastructure. Storage of research data exclusively by the researchers themselves or the immediate deletion of the data are permissible only if interests worthy of protection predominate or legal requirements stipulate this, or in case no suitable infrastructure for archiving these data is available."
university-of-potsdam_cropped.md,(3) The University of Potsdam recognizes the preparation of research data for reuse and the development of reusable research software as academic achievements. The same applies to contributions to the advancement of discipline-specific good practice in the handling of research data and research software. The research output of the University of Potsdam includes quality-assured data and software publications that are recognized by the respective scientific community.
university-of-potsdam_cropped.md,(4)	 All researchers are responsible for complying with good scientific practice regarding the handling of research data. The relevant discipline-specific guidelines by DFG review boards and academic associations on the handling of research data are to be taken into account. The following people bear special responsibility:
university-of-potsdam_cropped.md,"1. Principle investigators, in particular with regard to a project’s documentation, openness, and reusability of research data as well as data protection."
university-of-potsdam_cropped.md,"2. Research group leaders with regard to cross-project aspects of data handling (e.g., using common standards for the quality and storage of comparable data from several studies)."
university-of-potsdam_cropped.md,"(5) Research students and early career researchers are entitled to appropriate information, qualification, and support from teaching staff and supervisors. In disciplines working with data, basics of the practical handling of research data should be taught as comprehensive course content, starting at the undergraduate level. Opportunities for postgraduate training should be created for young scientists, lecturers, and supervisors."
university-of-potsdam_cropped.md,### II.	 Legal Framework
university-of-potsdam_cropped.md,(1)	 Legally binding regulations on the handling of research data remain unaffected and take precedence over this policy.
university-of-potsdam_cropped.md,"(2)	 Examples of legal and university regulations which result in rights and obligations with regard to research data are: 1. Regeln zur Sicherung guter wissenschaftlicher Praxis an der Universität Potsdam “Rules for Good Scientific Practice at the University of Potsdam”,3 2. Verfahrensordnung der Ethikkommission der Universität Potsdam “Rules of Procedure of the Ethics Committee of the University of Potsdam”,4 3. fundamental rights, in particular privacy rights, including data protection,5"
university-of-potsdam_cropped.md,"4.	 intellectual property rights (copyright and related rights as well as patent law and related commercial rights, including regulations regarding employee inventions)."
university-of-potsdam_cropped.md,"(3) Further binding regulations may result from agreements, e.g., in grant, cooperation, and license contracts. In particular, the requirements of funding bodies for the management, publishing, and archiving of research data must be met. Any restrictions on the openness and reusability of research data through contracts and other agreements that contravene the principles of this policy are to be avoided."
university-of-potsdam_cropped.md,### III.	 Institutional Responsibility
university-of-potsdam_cropped.md,"(1)	 As part of its research data strategy, the University of Potsdam commits itself to create the technical and organizational preconditions that enable compliance with this policy."
university-of-potsdam_cropped.md,"(2)	 The University of Potsdam initiates a cross-faculty discussion and development process on open science and the digital transformation in research, as well as on data handling competence training in teaching for degree courses and in postgraduate training."
university-of-potsdam_cropped.md,"(3)	 The University of Potsdam supports declarations and initiatives at the state, federal, European, and international levels that promote free access to research data, the recognition of data and software publications as research output, good practice in research data management, and good conditions for data-intensive research."
university-of-potsdam_cropped.md,(4)	 The activities of the University of Potsdam in the field of research data take gender and diversity aspects into account.
university-of-potsdam_cropped.md,### IV. Validity
university-of-potsdam_cropped.md,(1)	 This policy shall enter into force after the day of its publication in Amtliche Bekanntmachungen “Official Notices” of the University of Potsdam.
university-of-potsdam_cropped.md,"(2)	 It will be reviewed together with the associated research data strategy of the University of Potsdam when necessary, but no later than in 2023."
university-of-potsdam_cropped.md,## Recommendations for the Handling of Research Data at the University of Potsdam

university-of-reading.md,# Research Data Management Policy
university-of-reading.md,## Summary
university-of-reading.md,"This University is committed to the principles of Open Research.1 We subscribe to the principles of the UK Concordat on Open Research Data,2 and affirm that publicly-funded research data are a public good produced in the public interest, which should be made available with as few restrictions as possible in a timely and responsible manner.3 We recognise the fundamental importance of research data management in establishing the quality and integrity of research and enabling the verification of research findings. Datasets can also be valuable research outputs in their own right, and should be managed in such a way as to maximise their potential for use and impact."
university-of-reading.md,"University researchers are required to plan for data management, to collect and manage data responsibly during the research process, and to preserve and make accessible to the fullest extent possible data that substantiate research findings, considering any legal, ethical, commercial or practical restrictions that may apply. Wherever possible, data must be preserved and made accessible by means of an appropriate data repository, and in accordance with the FAIR Data Principles for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable research data.4"
university-of-reading.md,## Scope and application
university-of-reading.md,This policy covers all data collected or created under the authority of the University for the purposes of answering research questions. It includes any computer code created in research that is integral to the reproducibility of research results.
university-of-reading.md,"The policy applies to all researchers involved in collecting research data for or on behalf of the University, including researchers employed by the University, research students and visiting researchers. Data preservation and sharing requirements apply to undergraduate or taught postgraduate students if they are involved in research that results in the publication of peer-reviewed research outputs."
university-of-reading.md,## Responsibilities of researchers
university-of-reading.md,It is the responsibility of researchers to ensure that research data are managed and shared in accordance with this policy and other relevant policy requirements.5
university-of-reading.md,"Researchers are responsible for completing relevant training, including mandatory training for University employees in Information Security, Data Protection and Freedom of Information.6"
university-of-reading.md,"All researchers involved in the handling of research data in a project should understand their roles and responsibilities, and should seek clarification of these from the Principal Investigator where necessary."
university-of-reading.md,"Principal Investigators (including doctoral supervisors) are responsible for the management and sharing of research data collected in projects under their authority. They must ensure that the project complies with this policy and any other relevant policies, laws and contracts."
university-of-reading.md,## Data management planning
university-of-reading.md,"A data management plan (DMP) should be created at the outset of any project that involves the collection of data, and maintained for the duration of the project. The DMP should describe the data that will be collected, how the data will be collected and managed during the project, and measures that will be taken to preserve and share data in line with FAIR Principles on completion of the research and publication of findings."
university-of-reading.md,### Grant applications and costs
university-of-reading.md,"Where a DMP is required as part of a grant application, it should be reviewed by the University’s Research Data Service prior to submission of the application."
university-of-reading.md,"Equipment and infrastructure requirements for the collection, storage, processing and archiving of research data must be considered when developing proposals, and eligible costs should be included in grant applications."
university-of-reading.md,### Participant-based research
university-of-reading.md,"Where research involves participants, researchers must inform participants during recruitment of the intention to preserve and provide access to research data collected from them, unless for any reason it will not be possible to make data accessible to others. They must wherever possible plan to prepare data for sharing, usually by anonymisation, and identify an appropriate repository to deposit the data in, which may be an open data repository or one that can provide access to higher-risk data on a controlled basis."
university-of-reading.md,### Collaborations and research agreements
university-of-reading.md,"Where research is undertaken in collaboration with third parties, intellectual property rights in data, plans for data preservation and sharing, and legal responsibilities, for example in respect of personal data, must be agreed at the outset."
university-of-reading.md,"Collaborative research agreements should recognise the broad objectives of this policy, and allow for the timely sharing of research data in support of project findings, while accommodating the legitimate interests of parties to the agreement."
university-of-reading.md,## Managing research data
university-of-reading.md,"Research data should be managed by researchers in accordance with a data management plan, following defined procedures for data storage and backup, file naming and organisation, version control, quality control, documentation and metadata creation."
university-of-reading.md,Researchers must store and process data securely using University-approved infrastructure in accordance with the University’s Information Compliance policies.
university-of-reading.md,"### Preservation, sharing and disposal of data"
university-of-reading.md,"Data that substantiate published research findings (including doctoral theses) or that have long-term value must be preserved and made accessible using a suitable data repository wherever possible in accordance with the FAIR Data Principles for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable research data, considering any legal, ethical, commercial or practical restrictions that may apply."
university-of-reading.md,Data that are shared must be accompanied by sufficient documentation and relevant materials (such as code written to process data) to enable verification or reproduction of published results and re-use for research or other purposes.
university-of-reading.md,"Data collected from research participants should be shared wherever possible in anonymised form as open data or, in the case of higher-risk anonymised or identifiable data, by using a data repository that can hold and provide access to datasets under a controlled access procedure."
university-of-reading.md,"Where high volumes of data have been generated in the research, and it is not viable to deposit them in a data repository, they should where possible be held in University infrastructure. A metadata record describing the data should be published in the University’s Research Data Archive, so that they can be cited in related publications and interested parties can request access."
university-of-reading.md,### When data should be shared
university-of-reading.md,"Data supporting research findings must be made available no later than the date of first publication of research results, unless there is a legal, ethical, commercial or practical reason why data cannot be released at that time."
university-of-reading.md,"Disclosure of data associated with commercial exploitation of research may be delayed while IP protection is sought. Once protection is in place, data should be shared."
university-of-reading.md,### Use of data repositories
university-of-reading.md,Researchers must use a data repository to preserve and share data wherever possible. The University recommends the use of disciplinary and data type-specific repositories where appropriate; but all University researchers have the option of using the University’s Research Data Archive.
university-of-reading.md,"When a dataset has been deposited in a data repository external to the University or otherwise stored for preservation, the researcher should register the dataset with the University by creating a metadata record in the University’s Research Data Archive."
university-of-reading.md,### Formats and standards
university-of-reading.md,"Data should be preserved in open or widely-used file formats wherever possible, so that access is not dependent on purchase of a software licence. Data and associated metadata should be structured and described using relevant standards where these exist."
university-of-reading.md,## Rights and licensing
university-of-reading.md,"Data that are deposited in a data repository or disclosed to parties other than the members of the University and research collaborators must be accompanied by a rights statement identifying the owner(s) of intellectual property rights in the data, and a licence specifying the terms on which the data can be used."
university-of-reading.md,"Wherever possible, data should be made available under an open licence, such as the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) licence, in order to provide the broadest possible scope for re-use, unless legal obligations, third party rights, intellectual property rights or privacy rights preclude this."
university-of-reading.md,"More restrictive licences should be used where there is a well-founded reason to do so, for example, to protect commercial interests. Wherever possible in such cases a standard licence should be used, such as the Creative Commons AttributionNonCommercial (CC BY-NC) licence, which grants permission for use in research and teaching and other non-commercial activities."
university-of-reading.md,### Data availability statement and data citation
university-of-reading.md,"Any publication based on the use of data must include a data availability statement citing the supporting dataset in the holding repository by means of its digital object identifier (DOI) or other unique identifier, or referencing any alternative storage location, and stating on what terms the data may be accessed. The full citation for the dataset should be provided in the publication’s list of references."
university-of-reading.md,### Preservation term
university-of-reading.md,"Relevant data should be preserved for at least ten years after completion of a project, or for any longer minimum term specified in a funder’s policy."
university-of-reading.md,### Disposal of data
university-of-reading.md,Data that do not substantiate published research findings and do not have long-term value should be disposed of when they no longer serve a purpose. Data that contain personal or confidential information must be disposed of securely in accordance with University guidelines.7
university-of-reading.md,## Intellectual Property Rights
university-of-reading.md,"The University has ownership of intellectual property rights (IPR) in research datasets created in the course of research undertaken by researchers in its employment, unless rights have been contractually assigned to another party."
university-of-reading.md,"Ownership of IPR in a research dataset created by a student rests with the student, unless it has been assigned to another party under the terms of a contract of sponsorship or other agreement."
university-of-reading.md,"Where a dataset is the creation of more than one hand, IPR may be jointly held by more than one party."
university-of-reading.md,"Disclosure of data, for example by deposit in a data repository, must be with the permission of all rights-holders and subject to any relevant authorisation, such as by a project’s Principal Investigator. Where the University is the rights-holder, disclosure of research data must be in compliance with the Code of Practice on Intellectual Property.8 Subject to the above conditions, University employees are empowered under this policy to disclose or authorise the disclosure of data collected by them for research purposes, unless a reason for restriction exists."
university-of-reading.md,## Support for research data management
university-of-reading.md,"The University provides infrastructure and services to support the effective storage, management, preservation and sharing of research data collected under its authority, in compliance with this policy and related policies and external requirements."
university-of-reading.md,"The University's Research Data Service promotes and supports good practice in research data management and compliance with this policy, and manages the University’s data repository, the University of Reading Research Data Archive."
university-of-reading.md,The Research Data Service is based in the Research Engagement team in the Library. Contact details can be found on research data management website.9
university-of-reading.md,### Monitoring and compliance
university-of-reading.md,The University will monitor compliance with this policy on the part of its researchers and may take appropriate action where cases of non-compliance are identified.
university-of-reading.md,### Responsibility and review
university-of-reading.md,Responsibility for the Research Data Management Policy sits with the Pro-ViceChancellor (Research and Innovation) and the University Board for Research and Innovation.
university-of-reading.md,The Policy will be reviewed every three years.

university-of-reading.md,## Guidance
university-of-reading.md,### Related policies and other requirements
university-of-reading.md,Research data management is subject to some or all of the following policies and requirements:
university-of-reading.md,"the University’s Information Compliance policies, including inter alia the Data Protection, Encryption, Bring Your Own Device and Classification policies;10 the University’s Code of Practice on Intellectual Property;11"
university-of-reading.md,the University’s Code of Good Practice in Research;12
university-of-reading.md,"any legal obligations, including those specified in the Freedom of Information Act 2000, the Environmental Information Regulations 2004, and the Data Protection Act 2018;13"
university-of-reading.md,"any contractual obligations, such as the provisions of research agreements relating to the use and disclosure of intellectual property and publication of results; the data sharing policies of research funders."
university-of-reading.md,### Data management planning
university-of-reading.md,"A data management plan (DMP) describes the data that will be collected in the course of a research project, how the data will be collected and managed, how relevant ethical and legal requirements will be met, and measures that will be taken to ensure the preservation and sharing of data on completion of the research and publication of findings. A DMP also defines data management roles and responsibilities within a research project."
university-of-reading.md,"The University provides guidance on data management planning, and can advise on and review DMPs on request.14"
university-of-reading.md,### Grant applications and costs
university-of-reading.md,"Some funders require researchers to submit a DMP or discuss how they will manage, preserve and share research data as part of the grant application. Where this is required, the Research Development Manager supporting the application will ensure that the DMP is reviewed by the Research Data Service before the application is submitted. The University provides information about the requirements of funders and guidance on preparing DMPs.15"
university-of-reading.md,"Many funders of research accept that data management costs are legitimate research expenses. Requirements for the collection, storage, processing and archiving of research data must be considered when developing proposals, and eligible costs should be included in grant applications. Any third-party suppliers used for the processing of data must be approved by the University.16"
university-of-reading.md,### Participant-based research
university-of-reading.md,"Applications for ethical review of research proposals submitted to the University Research Ethics Committee (UREC) and to some School Research Ethics Committees must be accompanied by a DMP describing the data to be collected, measures that will be taken to protect participants’ data, and plans for sharing of research data. The DMP will be reviewed by the relevant Research Ethics Committee, which may specify requirements for the proposed research to receive a favourable opinion.17"
university-of-reading.md,### Planning for sharing of data collected from research participants
university-of-reading.md,"Wording that can be used to notify an intention to preserve and share data, either openly or under safeguards, is provided in the sample consent form provided by Information Management and Policy Services (IMPS). The IMPS Data Protection and Research guide provides guidance on anonymisation of research data.18"
university-of-reading.md,"If data collected from participants are considered to be sensitive or higher-risk and not suitable for public sharing, they can be archived in some repositories under controlled access procedures. The UK Data Service ReShare can hold anonymised safeguarded data and the University’s Research Data Archive can accept restricted datasets, which may include identifiable and confidential information.19"
university-of-reading.md,### Collaborations and research agreements
university-of-reading.md,Standard research agreements include provisions that support the objectives of this policy. Research Contracts will ensure the appropriate implementation of research agreements.20
university-of-reading.md,### Managing research data
university-of-reading.md,"Effective management of research data according to a data management plan will increase the efficiency of the research process, safeguard against corruption or loss of data, and make it easier to prepare data for preservation and sharing at the end of the project."
university-of-reading.md,"The University’s research data management website provides guidance on managing research data, including data storage, data organisation, file formats, quality control, documentation and metadata, and online survey tools available through the University.21"
university-of-reading.md,"### Preservation, sharing and disposal of data"
university-of-reading.md,Preservation and sharing of FAIR data entails:
university-of-reading.md,"the use of appropriate repository services to preserve, publish information about and provide access to the data; the use of open and widely-used standards to encode and describe the data; the use of open or other standard licences which define re-use permissions; the assignment to datasets of globally unique and persistent identifiers (such as a Digital Object Identifier or DOI), in order to enable citation, discovery and re-use."
university-of-reading.md,The FAIR Principles are described in detail on the Go FAIR website.22
university-of-reading.md,### What data should be preserved and shared
university-of-reading.md,"Sufficient data and supporting information to enable verification or reproduction of the research results and meaningful re-use should be preserved. Documentation should include details of the methods and instruments used to collect and process the data, and interpretive metadata, which may be in the form of a data dictionary or codebook."
university-of-reading.md,"While there may be legitimate legal and ethical reasons why some data cannot be shared, these can often be addressed by redaction of a dataset, for example to remove personal data, and/or by depositing data in a repository that provides access to data on a controlled basis (for example, subject to authorisation and under a data access agreement). Most data collected from participants can be preserved and shared on some basis. Researchers must inform participants of the intention to share data, either openly or under safeguards, during recruitment. Failure to do this is poor research practice."
university-of-reading.md,Sharing of data obtained from and about Indigenous Peoples should respect Indigenous Peoples' rights and interests in their data and should be undertaken in accordance with the CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance.23
university-of-reading.md,"Some areas of research, for example computational modelling, can generate large volumes of synthetic data. In such cases it may be more important - and more viable - to preserve the reproducibility of a method rather than a specific set of outputs, which might have little long-term value and be prohibitively expensive to maintain. It may be sufficient to preserve the code used to execute a model along with information about the input data used and the computing environment in which the model was run."
university-of-reading.md,Guidance on preserving and providing access to restricted and high-volume data is provided in the research data management website.24
university-of-reading.md,### When data should be shared
university-of-reading.md,"Researchers are entitled to a limited period of privileged use of the data they have collected to enable them to publish the results of their research. Once the research findings are placed on public record, the evidence to support those findings must be made accessible unless a justifiable exemption applies."
university-of-reading.md,The University provides assistance with the protection of intellectual property.25
university-of-reading.md,### Use of data repositories
university-of-reading.md,A data repository is a service that exists to preserve and provide access to research data. It supports the long-term management of and access to data in accordance with the FAIR Data Principles. Among other things a repository will:
university-of-reading.md,apply data and metadata standards to support interoperability and re-use;
university-of-reading.md,publish machine-readable metadata about a dataset to enable online discovery;
university-of-reading.md,"assign a persistent unique identifier, such as a DOI, to a dataset to make it citable and discoverable;"
university-of-reading.md,publish licence information to facilitate re-use.
university-of-reading.md,"A data repository should be the preferred solution for data preservation and sharing. Sharing of raw data as supplementary information alongside the article on the publisher’s website should be avoided. It is not acceptable to retain data in closed storage, to be made available on request, except where there is a well-founded legal, ethical, commercial or practical reason for doing so."
university-of-reading.md,"Most data collected from research participants can be deposited in a data repository either as anonymised open data, or, in the case of higher risk anonymised or identifiable data, by using a data repository that can hold and provide access to datasets under a controlled access procedure. For example, the UK Data Service can hold safeguarded data, and the University’s Research Data Archive can manage restricted datasets."
university-of-reading.md,Data centres and repositories serving disciplinary communities and catering to specialised types of research data should be used where they are available and suitable. Requirements or preferences of funders should be taken into account when considering the most suitable place of deposit for research data. The University of Reading Research Data Archive can be used in most cases in the absence of a suitable external service.
university-of-reading.md,The research data management website provides guidance on where to archive data26
university-of-reading.md,and on depositing data in the University’s Research Data Archive.27
university-of-reading.md,### Formats and standards
university-of-reading.md,"If data have been stored in a proprietary format, researchers should convert the data into an open or widely-accessible file format for preservation purposes. The research data management website provides guidance on preparing data for archiving.28"
university-of-reading.md,"Standards are community-defined sets of requirements, specifications, or guidelines that can be used to encode, structure and describe data. Examples of standards are:"
university-of-reading.md,"data models and associated formats for encoding specific types of data, e.g. the Network Common Data Form (NetCDF) standard for the numerical representation of scientific data, widely used in climate modelling, and the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) standard for organising neuroimaging and behavioural data; metadata standards for the structured description of data objects;29"
university-of-reading.md,controlled vocabularies;
university-of-reading.md,"persistent identifiers for entities, such as DOIs and ORCIDs."
university-of-reading.md,"Standards are essential to the machine-actionability of data and metadata, and support discovery, access, interoperability and re-use in accordance with the FAIR Principles. Repositories may require submission of data and metadata in conformity with specified standards."
university-of-reading.md,### Rights and licensing
university-of-reading.md,"The University does not prescribe the use of a specific licence, but recommends the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) licence or one with similar permissions for open data. An Open Source licence such as Apache or GNU GPL can be used to share software code. Where there is a need to restrict permissions, standard licences should be used where possible. The Creative Commons suite of licences includes versions with non-commercial, no derivatives and share alike terms."
university-of-reading.md,The research data management website provides guidance on licensing data30 and on publishing and licensing software code.31
university-of-reading.md,### Data availability statement and data citation
university-of-reading.md,The research data management website provides guidance on data availability statements and data citation.32
university-of-reading.md,The inclusion of a data availability statement in a publication is a requirement of the UKRI Open Access Policy.33
university-of-reading.md,### Preservation term
university-of-reading.md,Most data repositories undertake to hold datasets indefinitely. A minimum retention or preservation period may be specified in the repository’s policy.
university-of-reading.md,"The University’s Research Data Archive guarantees a minimum retention term of ten years, but is committed to the long-term preservation of research data. A dataset would only ordinarily be in scope for deletion if it had not been accessed for ten years. Datasets may be removed for other reasons, for example, if they are found to be in breach of the law or the rights of other parties. If a dataset is withdrawn from a repository, a ‘tombstone’ metadata record will be retained to preserve a citable record of the dataset."
university-of-reading.md,### Disposal of data
university-of-reading.md,IMPS provides guidelines for the retention and disposal of records.34
university-of-reading.md,## Intellectual Property Rights
university-of-reading.md,Further information is provided in the Code of Practice on Intellectual Property.35
university-of-reading.md,"Researchers who leave the University should ensure that any data belonging to the University are handed over to an appropriate data steward, such as their line manager, or, in default of any other person, the Head of School."
university-of-reading.md,## Support for research data management
university-of-reading.md,"The Research Data Service promotes good research data management practice through the provision of information, support and training; supports data management planning for research funding applications; manages the University’s data repository, the Research Data Archive; and monitors and supports compliance with this policy."
university-of-reading.md,"The Research Data Manager works with the Committee on Open Research and Research Integrity, the Committee for Research Infrastructure, relevant professional services and members of the research community to ensure that research data management is integrated into University policy and infrastructure."

university-of-south-wales.md,## Position Statement
university-of-south-wales.md,"The University of South Wales acknowledges and endorses the Research Council UK’s Common Principles on Data Policy statement1 that publicly funded research data are a public good, produced in the public interest, which should be made openly available with as few restrictions as possible in a timely and responsible manner that does not harm intellectual property.  For the purpose of this policy, the term “research data” is clarified as information gathered through the pursuit of research activity. Such information may be in a variety of forms including quantitative data, interview recordings or transcripts, video or audio recordings."
university-of-south-wales.md,"Research data management is of strategic importance to the university. The university provides an effective, safe and sustainable working environment, has developed appropriate policies and approaches based on current research lifecycle processes and expected best practice. Good research data management is important for securing research funding and we are keen to minimise risks associated with poor research data management."
university-of-south-wales.md,# Coverage
university-of-south-wales.md,"The following policy on Research Data Management applies to all research active staff and students. It needs to be acknowledged that this is an aspirational policy, and that implementation will take time. As a result the university will endeavour to manage research data to the highest standard throughout the research data lifecycle as part of the University’s commitment to research excellence."
university-of-south-wales.md,# Institutional Responsibility
university-of-south-wales.md,"The University will work to provide mechanisms where no appropriate subject or publisher repository exists for the storage, backup, registration, deposit and retention of research data assets in support of current and future access, during and after completion of research projects."
university-of-south-wales.md,"The University will work to provide training, support, advice and, where appropriate guidelines and templates for the research data management and research data"
university-of-south-wales.md,management plans.
university-of-south-wales.md,## Researcher Responsibility
university-of-south-wales.md,Direct responsibility for future research data management lies primarily with Principal Investigators who must ensure that data that has not been generated in a digital format is converted and stored in a timely manner.
university-of-south-wales.md,"Data Management/Sharing Plans All new research funding proposals must include research data management/ sharing plans that clearly address data capture, management, integrity, confidentiality and intellectual property, retention, sharing and publication."
university-of-south-wales.md,"• If any 3rd party data has been used, you must consider whether copyright clearance is necessary. You should ensure that you have obtained permission from the rights holder in writing before sharing or developing further data. Personal data must be processed in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998. The legitimate interests of the subjects of research data must be protected in line with the appropriate USW policy. Research data management/sharing plans must ensure that research data are available for access and re-use where appropriate and under appropriate safeguards. Researchers are encouraged to create data in an appropriate digital format wherever possible, in order to facilitate data re-use (open-by-default). Any data which is retained elsewhere, for example in an international data service or repository should be registered with the University of South Wales, along with the appropriate metadata. Research data that represent records of the University, including data that substantiate research findings, should be offered for deposit and retention in an appropriate national or international data service or repository where possible. Exclusive rights to reuse or publish research data should not be handed over to commercial publishers or agents without retaining the rights to make the data openly available for reuse, unless this is a condition of funding."

university-of-strathclyde.md,### 1. Introduction
university-of-strathclyde.md,"The University of Strathclyde (hereafter ‘the University’) believes that the highest standards of research quality and integrity are facilitated by the application of good practice in research data management and sharing (RDMS). The creation of and provision for data resources (i.e. digital data/files and analogue data) at research institutions is central to maintaining a progressive research environment. Research funders are also setting increasingly ambitious research data management and sharing expectations for Researchers and their institutions. This is in furtherance of their broader open research goals, particularly in promoting superior transparency of research findings (e.g. verification, reproducibility and replicability). Such a trend has therefore become reputational and is reflected in a growing number of scholarly journals and communities of practice, many of which mandate openness and sharing of any data accompanying publications."
university-of-strathclyde.md,"Research data processed by University Researchers (as defined in 1.2) is expected to be managed to a high standard throughout the research data lifecycle in support of the University’s Strategic Plan; to avoid data loss, contractual and/or data protection breaches; and to widely share the evidence which underpins research, for societal and public benefit. The University supports Researchers to achieve excellence through the provision of systems, infrastructure, tools, training and guidance via our cross-functional Research Data Management and Sharing (RDMS) Service."
university-of-strathclyde.md,#### 1.1 Purpose of the policy
university-of-strathclyde.md,"This policy provides key definitions, principles, policy and operational requirements of research data management and sharing along with an explanation of rights relating to research data. The purpose of this policy is to ensure that Researchers manage their research data effectively, enabling them to:"
university-of-strathclyde.md,"Comply with ethical, legal, funder and other requirements in relation to data and data management."
university-of-strathclyde.md,• Preserve eligible data for reuse within and outside of the University (as appropriate).
university-of-strathclyde.md,• Demonstrate the integrity of their research.
university-of-strathclyde.md,This Policy aligns with wider requirements and policies relating to research data management and sharing. This includes: University research policies (e.g. the Research Code of Practice and the Code of Practice for Postgraduate Research Students); external research-related concordats and agreements to which the University is committed (e.g. Concordat to Support Research Integrity and Concordat on Open Research Data); and funder and publisher requirements (e.g. UKRI research data policies and Open Access Policy).
university-of-strathclyde.md,#### 1.2 Key definitions
university-of-strathclyde.md,"Key definitions for the terms ‘Researcher’, ‘research data’ and ‘research data management and sharing’ are provided here. A full glossary of terms is provided in Appendix A."
university-of-strathclyde.md,#### Researcher
university-of-strathclyde.md,"Throughout the policy, the term ‘Researcher’ is used to refer to:"
university-of-strathclyde.md,"(i) University staff (whether holding employment or worker contracts) involved in the creation, collection, generation or processing of research data."
university-of-strathclyde.md,"(ii) Postgraduate Researchers (PGR) involved in the creation, collection, generation or processing of research data."
university-of-strathclyde.md,"(iii) Individuals who do not fall within (i) and (ii) above but who are otherwise associated with the University and are authorised to use the University’s name, facilities and/or services when involved in the creation, collection, generation or processing of research data (such persons would include, for example, those holding visiting, honorary or emeritus status)."
university-of-strathclyde.md,"Where expectations and requirements for Researchers differ by the role they hold (e.g. Principal Investigator, Postgraduate Researcher (PGR), or Supervisor) this is noted in Section 3. Nonetheless, each Researcher has a responsibility for the research data they are collecting and processing."
university-of-strathclyde.md,This policy does not apply to Undergraduate Students and Postgraduate Taught Students. The Intellectual Property issues associated with involving these students in research projects are addressed in ANNEX B of the Intellectual Property (IP) & Commercialisation policy.
university-of-strathclyde.md,#### Research data
university-of-strathclyde.md,"The definition of ‘research data’ for the purpose of this policy is digital or analogue (i.e. represented in a physical way) information that is created, collected, and/or reused to produce, validate and/or enrich research findings."
university-of-strathclyde.md,‘Research data’ therefore includes:
university-of-strathclyde.md,"Data collected through any methodology (e.g. by experimentation, observation, modelling, interview or other methods)"
university-of-strathclyde.md,Data obtained from existing sources
university-of-strathclyde.md,Quantitative data
university-of-strathclyde.md,Qualitative data
university-of-strathclyde.md,Raw or primary data (e.g. direct from measurement or collection)
university-of-strathclyde.md,Data derived from primary data for subsequent analysis or interpretation (e.g. as an extract of a larger dataset)
university-of-strathclyde.md,Data derived from existing sources where the rights may be held by others.
university-of-strathclyde.md,### Research data management and sharing
university-of-strathclyde.md,"‘Research data management and sharing’ refers to the collection, organisation, storage, sharing and preservation of data throughout a research project and forms a key component of ensuring research integrity."
university-of-strathclyde.md,‘Research data management and sharing’ covers:
university-of-strathclyde.md,"Initial planning, routine processes for data (file) management and organisation (e.g. back-up processes; folder and file-naming systems; version-control strategies; quality control measures; data documentation). Consolidation and incorporation of any contractual matters relating to the research (e.g. collaborative research terms stipulated in a collaboration agreement, Material Transfer Agreement or similar). Observance of appropriate ethical, legal and professional frameworks, obligations and standards, including conditions of ethical approval. • Long-term archiving, removal, restriction and/or sharing of data."
university-of-strathclyde.md,### 1.3 Scope of the Policy
university-of-strathclyde.md,"This policy applies to all research data processed by Researchers in the course of their activities at the University. The specific requirements for Researchers will differ according to the nature of the project and whether the project is funded. Research data subject to funder, regulatory and contractual requirements must be managed according to those requirements and any exceptions should be approved by the sponsor, funder or relevant authority."
university-of-strathclyde.md,"This policy outlines expectations on Researchers regarding best practice in research data management and sharing. Aspects of the policy which are mandatory are differentiated using the word ‘must’. The guidance associated with this policy details best practice for data storage, sharing and the preservation of data and provides examples of what is appropriate, proportionate and realistic."
university-of-strathclyde.md,### 2. Principles of research data management and sharing
university-of-strathclyde.md,"In recognition that not all research data can be shared openly, the University’s approach to assessing the suitability of data for sharing is that data should be ‘as open as possible and as closed as necessary’. This means that data should be ‘open’ in order to foster reusability and to accelerate research, but ‘closed’ when required by legal, ethical, security and/or commercial constraints or if considered necessary to safeguard the safety and wellbeing of those involved in the research. In line with the University’s strategic commitment to progress towards FAIR open data policies, whenever possible data and/or descriptive metadata produced by the University should be:"
university-of-strathclyde.md,Findable: easy to find for both humans and computers.
university-of-strathclyde.md,Accessible: accompanied by clear instructions for access and authorisation.
university-of-strathclyde.md,"Interoperable: can be integrated with other data and/or work in conjunction with applications or workflows for analysis, storage and processing."
university-of-strathclyde.md,"Reusable: suitably described to allow further use, released with a clear and accessible data usage licence."
university-of-strathclyde.md,These FAIR data principles are regarded as a key element of good research data management and sharing practice by offering both Researchers and research institutions a standardised framework for the creation and stewardship of research data.
university-of-strathclyde.md,### 3. Policy requirements
university-of-strathclyde.md,"When conducting research, Researchers are responsible for managing the data they create, collect and process. In general, overall responsibility for data management rests with the Principal Investigator of a project or study. Similarly, Postgraduate Researchers are responsible for managing the data they create, collect and process, with support and guidance to be provided by Supervisors. However, the Primary Supervisor has overall responsibility for ensuring that all research is organised and undertaken within a framework of best practice, as stated in the Code of Practice for Postgraduate Research Students."
university-of-strathclyde.md,"All Researchers can access support in relation to compliance with external and University research data management and sharing requirements, including the requirements in this Policy, from the Research Data Management and Sharing (RDMS) service. Support for ethical matters can be sought from the University Ethics Committee; support for contractual matters can be sought from Grants and Contracts Team in RKES."
university-of-strathclyde.md,"#### 3.1 Researchers should ensure research data is managed responsibly and must adhere to ethical, legal, funder and other mandated requirements."
university-of-strathclyde.md,"3.1.1 All Researchers are expected to familiarise themselves with University research data management and sharing requirements and solutions, as well as disciplinary tools and infrastructure, including all costs, terms, and conditions governing their research. This includes being aware of and adhering to all relevant legislation and policies concerning data protection, copyright and Intellectual Property (IP) as outlined in Section 4."
university-of-strathclyde.md,"3.1.2 Principal Investigators must be aware of University and funder data requirements/terms and conditions of award; any project-related contractual and/or ethical agreements, and organise and direct data management activities, systems, and services accordingly. Principal Investigators should ensure all Researchers in the project team are aware of research data management and sharing policies and data requirements, as well as any contractual agreements which may impact on research data (for example, where there is a confidentiality agreement, which would necessitate a restriction or embargo to the release of data)."
university-of-strathclyde.md,"3.1.3 Postgraduate Researchers are expected to be familiar with relevant, University and funder data policies and requirements, and best practice in their discipline."
university-of-strathclyde.md,"3.1.4 All Supervisors of Postgraduate Researchers are expected to provide support and guidance to supervisees. The Primary Supervisor must ensure supervisees are aware of research data management and sharing policies and data requirements, as well as any contractual agreements which may impact on research data (for example, where there is a confidentiality agreement, which would necessitate a restriction or embargo to the release of data)."
university-of-strathclyde.md,"3.1.5 As a means to ensure the responsible management of research data, all student (PGR) and staff research projects are required to have a Data Management Plan (DMP) in place prior to the commencement of research (termed the ‘Provisional DMP’)1. This applies to all research projects regardless of whether there are funder data requirements/terms and conditions of awards. The Provisional DMP should document key decisions concerning data collection, storage, sharing and preservation (including what is and is not appropriate to share), and be kept up to date during the course of the project. As outlined in Section 4, in the interests of transparency and to enable monitoring of research data management and sharing practice, a copy of both the Provisional DMP and the version in place at project completion (termed the ‘Final DMP’) should be uploaded to the Data Management Plan inbox. These DMP documents will be retained for the same period as the associated research data (see section 4.6). If there is no associated research data, the documentation will be retained for three years following project completion to inform policy and guidance."
university-of-strathclyde.md,"#### 3.2 Research data should be made openly available where possible, in a timely and responsible manner and any restrictions should be minimised and justified."
university-of-strathclyde.md,"3.2.1 All Researchers should seek to make data ‘as open as possible, as closed as necessary’, respecting any necessary restrictions on research data sharing due to legal, ethical, security and/or commercial constraints or safety concerns, and support the preparation and preservation of data in the most appropriate manner. Where appropriate, consent for data sharing should be sought from research participants at the outset, and considered as part of the ethical approval process."
university-of-strathclyde.md,"3.2.2 Principal Investigators are responsible for assessing the suitability of data for public sharing, in line with any external and University research data management and sharing requirements. It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator to ensure that data is prepared and preserved via data deposit in Pure or an external repository subject to the appropriate restrictions, license and re-use agreements. As outlined in Section 4, where an external repository is used, a metadata record must be created in Pure."
university-of-strathclyde.md,"3.2.3 For Postgraduate Research projects, decisions about the suitability for sharing/publication, and future reuse of research data, should be taken jointly between the Postgraduate Researcher and the Primary Supervisor, in consideration of any ethics and/or project collaboration agreements and commercialisation issues, as well as funder data policy/requirements and University policy. The Primary Supervisor is ultimately responsible for ensuring that data is prepared and preserved via data deposit in Pure or an external repository subject to the appropriate restrictions, license and re-use agreements, though it is expected to be the Postgraduate Researcher who completes these tasks. As outlined in Section 4, where an external repository is used, a metadata record must be created in Pure."
university-of-strathclyde.md,#### 3.3 Researchers should ensure that appropriate records are kept to demonstrate the integrity of their research.
university-of-strathclyde.md,"3.3.1 Proper research data management is a key part of ensuring the integrity of the research record. All Researchers should maintain a robust and reliable audit trail, which can be followed to establish the authenticity of any discovery or invention and to defend the results of genuine research endeavour."
university-of-strathclyde.md,"3.3.2 Principal Investigators are responsible for ensuring that record-keeping is sufficient to demonstrate the quality, consistency and authenticity of the research. Examples of good record-keeping in research include retaining master copies of data, and applying a systemic version-control strategy for subsequent versions (iterations); appropriately marking-up revisions – without deleting content; developing a Data Management Plan to document ongoing decisions about data (file) management; and employing robust quality-control procedures."
university-of-strathclyde.md,"3.3.3 For Postgraduate Research projects, data management decisions must be recorded in a Data Management Plan (see Section 4), as stated in the Code of Practice for Postgraduate Research Students. It is the responsibility of the Postgraduate Researcher to maintain records in order to demonstrate the integrity of their research to their Supervisory Team, to examiners and to the wider academic community once published."
university-of-strathclyde.md,"3.3.4 For Staff research projects which are collecting, generating and/or using data, data management decisions must be recorded in a Data Management Plan in accordance with University/Funder policies (if applicable) and sector best practice."
university-of-strathclyde.md,### 4. Operational requirements
university-of-strathclyde.md,"The following operational requirements, which flow from the policy requirements in Section 3, are outlined to support Researchers to meet the principles and requirements related to research data management and to ensure research data are managed and disseminated in accordance with good research practice."
university-of-strathclyde.md,#### 4.1 Research projects working with research data are expected to create a project Data Management Plan (DMP) and data management costs should be factored into project applications as part of the grant submission process.
university-of-strathclyde.md,"4.1.1 In accordance with University/funder policies and sector best practice, all student (PGR) and staff research projects are required to have a DMP. As outlined in 3.1.5, a Provisional DMP should be in place prior to project commencement and updates should be made as required over the course of the project (treating it as a ‘living’ document), resulting in a Final DMP on project completion. The DMP should document key decisions concerning data collection, storage, sharing and preservation as appropriate to the project and in accordance with applicable funder data requirements and/or contractual/ethical agreements. In the interests of transparency and to enable monitoring of research data management and sharing practice, a copy of the Provisional DMP should be uploaded to the Data Management Plan inbox prior to project commencement and the Final DMP (reflecting any decisions/updates made during the project) should be similarly submitted once the project is complete."
university-of-strathclyde.md,"4.1.2 If the required resources to ensure effective research data management and sharing are not already available, these should be costed into project applications as appropriate. Researchers should consider costs that will be directly incurred, for example, researcher time to prepare data for preservation. Some research funders will cover expenses and costs relating to data management activities, if fully justified at application stage; for example, UKRI guidance states that ‘Support may be requested for any costs related to research data management which will be incurred during the project and not be covered by directly allocated or indirect costs.’2 Guidance on costing research projects can be sought from the Costing and Pricing Team in RKES."
university-of-strathclyde.md,"4.1.3 Researchers can use the University’s generic DMP template, which contains local information and prompts. Tailored templates, such as those that adhere to funder requirements, can be found on DMP Online. When applying for funding grants and bids, Researchers are likely to be asked to structure the DMP to fit the funder or scheme-specific template."
university-of-strathclyde.md,"4.1.4 Researchers can upload draft DMPs to the DMP Inbox for review and feedback. To assist Researchers with preparing a plan, there are also Data Management Plan tips on the RDMS website; training is available; and one-to-one meetings can be arranged to discuss data management planning for individual projects (requests should be made via email to researchdataprojects@strath.ac.uk)."
university-of-strathclyde.md,#### 4.2 Arrangements for the long-term storage of large datasets should be factored into data management planning and costed into grant applications where appropriate.
university-of-strathclyde.md,4.2.1 A decision on the long-term storage of large datasets will be assessed when offered for deposit. Datasets are considered large if they cannot be adequately dealt with by traditional data processing applications and infrastructure due to their size and complexity.
university-of-strathclyde.md,"4.2.2 If the research outputs from a funded project are expected to include very large datasets, this should be identified and costed at the DMP and grant application stage. This information will support RDMS Service decisions on storing and archiving large datasets."
university-of-strathclyde.md,"4.2.3 Very large data can be deposited in Pure on condition that it is appropriately packaged and documented. No individual files should exceed 20GB. FAIR consideration for re-use should ensure the data is accessible from the Pure Knowledgebase. Extremely large datasets may be held off-line in exceptional circumstances, in bespoke storage locations operated by the RDMS Service."
university-of-strathclyde.md,"4.2.4  Storing the files in such bespoke storage locations is not conducive to FAIR data principles, negatively impacting the findability and accessibility of the data. Planning at an early stage with the DMP will mitigate this possibility including any compliance requirements pertaining to data accessibility, and identify cases where the size of the data means that such bespoke storage locations become necessary."
university-of-strathclyde.md,"4.2.5  Projects must contact RDMS support to discuss the deposit of very large data, ideally at the DMP and deposit stages."
university-of-strathclyde.md,"4.3 Rights, licences, ownership and ethical considerations related to research data should be recognised and agreed at the earliest opportunity within a project."
university-of-strathclyde.md,"4.3.1 Where research involves collaboration with external parties/partners, Strathclyde Researchers must seek advice from Grants and Contract staff in RKES to arrange an appropriate contract and/or collaboration/consortia-type agreement that clearly records the rights each party possess and permissions each party provides to ensure research data can be used for current and future research."
university-of-strathclyde.md,"4.3.2 Data should be deposited with a clear license on the reuse of data. License options are available when finalising deposits in Pure. CC-BY is the preferred license for open data, which allows data users to copy, modify and distribute data in any format for any purpose, including commercial use, provided they acknowledge the data creators and give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made."
university-of-strathclyde.md,"4.3.3 Not all research data are suitable for open/public sharing, for example, research data containing protectable intellectual property or ‘personal data’ about research participants. In such cases, Researchers are encouraged to contact RDMS staff to discuss the most appropriate options for the data. Licence and re-use agreements can be tailored according to project requirements."
university-of-strathclyde.md,#### 4.4 Research data must be securely stored and managed throughout the time period they are retained.
university-of-strathclyde.md,"4.4.1 The University will identify active storage systems, which are suitable for storage of data during the active phase of research (while a project is ongoing), and long-term preservation systems, which are suitable for storage of data after a project has completed. Decisions on which storage systems are considered suitable for each phase will be taken by the University’s RDMS staff, and kept under regular review. These decisions will be taken in consultation with IS Infrastructure staff, and communicated to researchers.3"
university-of-strathclyde.md,"4.4.2 Whilst a project is ongoing, research data should be securely stored on resilient, robust University active storage systems, and managed in line with the associated DMP. However, data should not be stored long-term on these systems. Data/files held on active storage platforms, such as Departmental/School i: drives, are not subject to the same preservation measures as they are when deposited in Pure (or another data repository). Moreover, data/files held in storage, linked to an individual’s DS login account (e.g., H: drive; Strathcloud personal folders; OneDrive for Business, etc.) will be deleted if/when the staff member/student leaves/graduates from the University."
university-of-strathclyde.md,"4.4.3 Following project completion, data should be archived for long term accessibility, curation and preservation in a suitable long-term preservation system. When data are deposited in Pure - as a dataset - they are catalogued, associated with metadata, assigned a persistent link/DOI, and are subject to preservation activity by Library staff, and thereafter retained for a minimum period of 10- years. Completed datasets deposited in Pure are additionally processed using the Archivematica Digital Preservation system."
university-of-strathclyde.md,"4.4.4 Once the project has completed, and the completed data has been stored on a suitable long-term preservation system, the data on the active storage system must be reviewed and deleted if it is no longer required on that system.  Decisions around deletion of data from the active store must recognise the significant ongoing financial cost to the University, and the environmental impact, of retaining data in the active store unnecessarily."
university-of-strathclyde.md,"4.4.5 Sensitive data, for example, research data containing protectable intellectual property or ‘personal data’ about research participants, can be stored in Pure with the appropriate confidentiality restrictions, for example, by restricting visibility of the complete dataset, or applying an embargo to specific files. Restrictions should be minimised by any means possible, for instance by providing accessible information about how the data was collected, whether it can be accessed on a one-toone basis under a non-disclosure agreement (NDA), or whether a subset of the data can be made available). Guidance on handling and preparing sensitive data is available from the RDMS Service."
university-of-strathclyde.md,"#### 4.5 Research data and accompanying metadata and documentation must be registered in the University’s research information system, Pure."
university-of-strathclyde.md,"4.5.1  To support University monitoring and reporting on the research data produced by its Researchers, and to ensure the data are Findable, dataset records must be created and ultimately finalised in Pure following project completion or at the point of publication if this occurs during the project. As a general rule, data should be deposited in Pure within 3 months of project completion, unless necessary restrictions apply."
university-of-strathclyde.md,"4.5.2 In cases where a dataset is deposited with a trusted external data repository, for example, a subjectspecific repository or one operated by the lead institution on a project, Researchers must create a dataset record in Pure, with metadata and a persistent identifier, such as a Digital Object Identifier (DOI), directing to the source of the externally deposited dataset. There are numerous data repositories, some domain-specific, others which are advocated by a funder or publisher. Researchers should check if external data repositories specialising in their research area already exist and prioritise deposit in these repositories as they are designed for their disciplines and datasets. Assistance on locating such resources and evaluating their suitability against FAIR principles, University policy and any project-specific agreements can be accessed from the RDMS Service."
university-of-strathclyde.md,"4.5.3 As far as possible, data deposited externally should be openly accessible. If external data are deposited in a restricted format and the dataset is at risk of deletion, Researchers should offer this data for deposit in Pure for preservation purposes."
university-of-strathclyde.md,"4.5.4 In cases where the research is sensitive and/or confidential, a Researcher may request that the data (and descriptive metadata) are embargoed or restricted (for instance, to allow time to publish research findings, or comply with contractual obligations). Decisions to approve requests will be made by the RDMS Service in the first instance, although responsibility for ensuring deposited datasets with sensitive or confidential data are restricted in Pure lies with the Researcher."
university-of-strathclyde.md,"4.5.5  Each dataset in Pure should have an assigned contact responsible for dealing with any enquiries relating to the dataset. The contact person will normally be the Principal Investigator. If the Principal Investigator leaves the University, a new contact person should be identified before the departure date. If no new contact person is identified, it will default to the relevant Head of School /Department."
university-of-strathclyde.md,"4.5.6  Where a dataset record draft is started but not finalised, it can remain as an ‘entry in progress’ record for a maximum of 24 months, after which point the record will be deleted. Where a dataset record is required to remain at ‘entry in progress’ for longer than 24 months, an appropriate maximum retention period should be noted in the dataset description."
university-of-strathclyde.md,"4.5.7  Dataset records must by related to any other relevant content in Pure including publications, projects, activities and impacts."
university-of-strathclyde.md,"4.6 Research data that contribute to published research findings, or that have acknowledged long-term value, must be retained for a minimum of 10 years, or longer if stipulated by the funder or advised by discipline convention."
university-of-strathclyde.md,"4.6.1 Research data that contribute to published research findings must be deposited as in the requirement above and must be retained in order to demonstrate the integrity of the research and any published research findings. For guidance on how research data deposit activities align with the publication timeline, see the RDMS Integrated Workflow."
university-of-strathclyde.md,"4.6.2 Research data that underpins research findings must be preserved for a minimum period of 10 years, from date of last access/use. In some disciplines, such as clinical trial data, the advised retention period may be 20 years; for environmental data, this may be indefinite."
university-of-strathclyde.md,"4.6.3 Some funders require that data with acknowledged long-term value also be preserved and remain accessible and usable for future research4. Data with acknowledged long-term value should be preserved for a minimum period of 10 years, from date of last access/use, as above."
university-of-strathclyde.md,4.6.4 A minimum retention period longer than 10 years may be specified by third parties for specific types of research output. Researchers can check the required retention period with the RDMS Service.
university-of-strathclyde.md,"#### 4.7 Documentation accompanying research data should be sufficient to understand, analyse, replicate, and re-use this data."
university-of-strathclyde.md,"4.7.1 Descriptive Metadata should be sufficient to ensure discovery, even in cases where public access to the data is restricted or has been removed."
university-of-strathclyde.md,"4.7.2 Documentation may be contained in many research outputs, including survey questionnaires, codebooks, standard operating procedures, informed consent forms, processing scripts, software code, workflows and other research outputs. Documentation should comply with the guidelines appropriate to the discipline in which the research is performed, and the type of research data produced."
university-of-strathclyde.md,"4.7.3 At a minimum, a Readme file describing the uploaded dataset files, file naming conventions, and folder structures must accompany finalised dataset deposits in Pure. It is the responsibility of Researchers to provide sufficient description in their metadata. Datasets with inadequate metadata may be returned to Researchers for further detail."
university-of-strathclyde.md,"4.7.4 In cases where a research project/study involves external collaboration, Researchers must consult the relevant collaboration agreement for details of agreed publication processes/protocol. In the absence of a formal collaboration agreement, decisions concerning the sharing of data and publication of results should be documented in the Data Management Plan prior to project commencement; any subsequent changes to the plan should be made with the consent off all parties concerned."
university-of-strathclyde.md,#### 4.8 Published research outputs should include information on how to access deposited research data and other supporting material.
university-of-strathclyde.md,"4.8.1 Researchers must include a Data Access (Availability) Statement in their Accepted Author Manuscripts (AAM). Data Access Statements in publications - ‘even where there are no data associated with the article or the data are inaccessible’ - are a requirement of UKRI policy5, and many publishers also ask for them.6"
university-of-strathclyde.md,"4.8.2 Within the Data Access Statement, the dataset should be cited using a persistent identifier such as a Digital Object Identifier (DOI), which will be provided during the dataset deposit process in Pure. Data Access Statements provide transparency and improve the Accessibility of the data - in keeping with FAIR principles. Moreover, their inclusion alerts readers to the existence and location of data, subsequently contributing to dataset usage/downloads, which will be a factor in assessing the overall impact of the research."
university-of-strathclyde.md,"4.8.3 Researchers should refer to the University Research Publications Guidance which advises on key aspects of preparing a research publication, including Data Access Statements. Further information is available on the Data Access Statements webpage."
university-of-strathclyde.md,### 5. Rights relating to research data
university-of-strathclyde.md,"Ownership is a critical consideration in the management and sharing of research data. All right-holders should be identified at the earliest opportunity so that appropriate action can be taken to uphold their rights in accordance with relevant legislation and policies including the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR); UK Copyright law; and the University’s Intellectual Property (IP) & Commercialisation Policy. Besides Researchers, typical holders of rights to research data are collaborators, research participants, existing data owners and the University (as employer). The following examples illustrate some of the considerations that relate to these:"
university-of-strathclyde.md,"Collaborators: Where research projects/studies involve collaboration with partners, industry, NHS etc., in most cases collaboration and contractual agreements will be drawn up to manage and document these partnerships. These legal agreements and contracts must be factored into project data management planning so that data are managed in line with agreed processes and licence agreements, and to ensure that data, which may, for example, not be suitable for public disclosure are not released inadvertently. The project Principal Investigator is responsible for appraising supervisees about any contractual agreements and the University’s Research and Knowledge Exchange Services (RKES) should be consulted in matters relating to legal, ethical, or commercial rights. If a formal collaboration agreement is not required, decisions regarding the storage and sharing of data should be documented in the Data Management Plan prior to project commencement, with any subsequent changes made with the consent off all parties concerned."
university-of-strathclyde.md,"Research participants: Where research has involved the collection and/or processing of personal data, data protection legislation and ethical requirements must be complied with to ensure that the participants’ rights are respected. Where a research project/study has involved collecting data from people, for example, from focus groups or interviews, and there is a plan to publish large extracts of participants’ words, appropriate transfer of copyright must be in place.7"
university-of-strathclyde.md,"Existing data owners: Where a project/study has used existing or secondary data sources, Researchers would not be expected to deposit existing/secondary data sources in Pure (unless there is a project agreement to state otherwise) - as they belong to the original data creators/owners. Instead, Researchers should include details of any published existing data sources used in the research by including the hyperlinks to the sources, initially in the DMP, and in the metadata - i.e., when describing the dataset. This way anyone wishing to scrutinise the research, would know where, and how, to access the existing/secondary data sources used, and then they too could arrange access for themselves. New data, derived from analyses of existing/secondary sources, can be deposited in Pure (if appropriate)."
university-of-strathclyde.md,"The University: In most cases, the IP generated by University Staff and Postgraduate Researchers in the course of their employment is the property of the University (making research data a Universityowned asset). For this reason, research data must be deposited into the institutional repository, Pure, at the end of the project or when a Researcher leaves employment and/or study with the University.8"

university-of-surrey.md,## 1 Introduction
university-of-surrey.md,### 1.1 Purpose
university-of-surrey.md,"1.1.1 The University of Surrey is committed to openness in research, as articulated in our Open Research Position Statement, which serves as an overarching framework for the current policy. We recognise the role of open research data in advancing scholarship, demonstrating academic integrity, and increasing transparency in research. Good practices in the management, dissemination, and preservation of research data are vital to a culture of open research. The University is committed to fulfilling compliance requirements around research data from third parties such as funders, publishers, government agencies, and external sponsors (see 3.5 legislative context)."
university-of-surrey.md,### 1.2 Scope
university-of-surrey.md,1.2.1 This policy applies to all research data regardless of whether the research is funded or unfunded. It applies to all researchers but is unlikely to apply to undergraduate research except in exceptional circumstances (e.g. contributions towards publishable research).
university-of-surrey.md,### 1.3 Definitions
university-of-surrey.md,"Data Management Plan. A document addressing how research data will be captured, managed, stored, shared, and published, and how the integrity, security, and confidentiality of data will be maintained. It should be updated as necessary throughout active research projects."
university-of-surrey.md,"Metadata. Any documentation and descriptive information relevant to research data and research conclusions can be considered metadata. Some scholarly communities may have formal metadata standards for research data, which researchers should follow when appropriate. Metadata records in this policy refer to descriptive information about research data that is held by the Library to facilitate discoverability, sharing, and retention."
university-of-surrey.md,"Open Access repository. An Open Access repository is an online database of research outputs, configured to support the storage, online discovery and machine-readability of its content. Institutional repositories, such as the University of Surrey Open Access repository, hold the research outputs of their institution. They can include publications, theses, research data and other research outputs; Open Access as well as restricted items; and full texts as well as bibliographic records. Subject or disciplinary repositories, such as PubMedCentral, can host outputs from several institutions."
university-of-surrey.md,"Research data. The University of Surrey considers research data to be any material collected, observed, processed, or created for the purpose of analysis and on which research findings and outputs are based. This includes data and documentation which is commonly accepted in the scholarly community as necessary for validation or replication of research findings. Research data may be in digital or non-digital formats."
university-of-surrey.md,"Researchers. The University of Surrey defines researchers as members of the University, including staff, doctoral and postgraduate students, visiting researchers, and those who conduct research on University premises, use University facilities for research, or work on University research projects."
university-of-surrey.md,## 2 Policy Principles
university-of-surrey.md,"2.1 Research data will be managed throughout the research data lifecycle in accordance with other University policies and legal, funder, regulatory, and ethical requirements. Researchers are expected to manage and respect any confidentiality, privacy, national security, indigenous rights, and intellectual property aspects of their research data."
university-of-surrey.md,"Principal investigators are responsible for ensuring all members of the research team abide by the University’s research data management requirements, including making sure all members of the research team are aware of and abide by any applicable data management plans created."
university-of-surrey.md,2.2 Any research activity where research data may be created or re-used should include at the outset a data management plan. These plans are to be updated and maintained during the life of the research project.
university-of-surrey.md,"Researchers, in particular principal investigators, are responsible for creating and updating a research data management plan for research projects in accordance with funder and university expectations."
university-of-surrey.md,"2.3 For data underpinning published research findings, reasonable efforts should be made to make them available for access and re-use with as few restrictions as possible, where legally, ethically and commercially appropriate. This should be done in a timely manner, no later than 12 months after publication or as soon as required by publishers and funders."
university-of-surrey.md,"2.4 Where it can be made accessible, research data should be deposited in a data service, disciplinary data repository, or the University’s Open Access repository as appropriate."
university-of-surrey.md,"Researchers are responsible for identifying, preparing, and transferring data for sharing and/or preservation to appropriate repositories, including the University’s repository. In special cases, Library and IT Services may facilitate transfer and dissemination (e.g. very large datasets or sensitive data)."
university-of-surrey.md,"2.5 Unless explicitly stated in a collaborative contract where Intellectual Property Right (IPR) or data responsibility is retained by another institution, all research data must be registered with the University by creating a metadata record in the University’s repository, even if the data is hosted elsewhere (e.g., in a third-party repository)."
university-of-surrey.md,Researchers are responsible for registering their research data by creating a metadata record in the University’s repository or by sending a link to an existing repository record to the Library’s Open Research team. Metadata and data records created in the University repository are considered registered. The Library will be responsible for holding and making publicly available these metadata records.
university-of-surrey.md,"2.6 Research data that substantiate research findings or is of long-term value should be preserved in an appropriate format with adequate documentation for verification and reuse for a minimum of 10 years from project end or as long as is mandated by funder, ethical, legal, or regulatory requirements."
university-of-surrey.md,2.7 A data access or availability statement should be included in published papers. It should describe where and on what terms supporting research data may be accessed.

university-of-the-west-of-england.md,# UWE Research Data Management Policy
university-of-the-west-of-england.md,## 1 Introduction and Purpose
university-of-the-west-of-england.md,### Context
university-of-the-west-of-england.md,"The University’s Research Strategy aims to achieve globally recognised research with real world impact. The Research Data Management Policy supports this aim by seeking to increase the quality, integrity and accessibility of UWE Bristol’s research data which can lead to greater research impact and enhanced reputation."
university-of-the-west-of-england.md,"The policy reflects the UWE Bristol Open Research Statement which encourages our researchers to be as open as possible, as early as possible, and to explore options for open research including open access publication of research findings and open sharing of data, taking account of university and other policies."
university-of-the-west-of-england.md,"Research data management is the effective handling of data that is accessed, used or created in the course of research. Effective research data management is carried out for the entire lifecycle of the research data, from the point of creation through to dissemination, publication and archiving. Aspects of research data management will usually continue long after the initial research project has ended."
university-of-the-west-of-england.md,"Managing and sharing research data can increase its visibility (and consequently the visibility of research), ensuring the full potential of research is exploited. This can then provide a growing resource for further research, education and training."
university-of-the-west-of-england.md,### Purpose
university-of-the-west-of-england.md,The University considers the safe and effective management of research data to be integral to good research practice. This purpose of this policy is therefore:
university-of-the-west-of-england.md,"1. To promote the highest standards of research integrity by ensuring that research data accessed, used or produced by UWE Bristol staff and post graduate research (PGR) students, or under UWE’s auspices, is managed (created, stored, used, reused, archived or destroyed) according to good research practice and ethical requirements, legal and regulatory frameworks and funder requirements."
university-of-the-west-of-england.md,"2. To establish sound research data management practices which protect the interests of research participants and researchers, and which support the proper conduct of research and validation of research findings."
university-of-the-west-of-england.md,"3. To promote appropriate preservation, sharing and re-use of research data."
university-of-the-west-of-england.md,4. To provide broad and inclusive guidance which enable all employees and PGRs to manage their research data effectively.
university-of-the-west-of-england.md,5. To outline the responsibilities and requirements of the University and its researchers.
university-of-the-west-of-england.md,Research Data Security Guidance Data Protection Standard for Research
university-of-the-west-of-england.md,## 2 Scope and Definitions
university-of-the-west-of-england.md,The policy applies to all UWE Bristol employees and PGR students who produce or use research data as part of their research (hereafter “researchers’) regardless of the research funding source.
university-of-the-west-of-england.md,"The policy applies to all research data, or materials, (digital or physical) created, cocreated or used by all UWE Bristol staff or PGR students."
university-of-the-west-of-england.md,Research Data is all data or materials (digital or physical) arising as a result of a research project.
university-of-the-west-of-england.md,"Research data can be raw data, analysed data, and data which arise during the course of research, including data later translated into another form or destroyed, such as audio and video recordings. Examples of research data include, but are not limited to, statistics, collections of digital images, sound and video recordings, transcripts of interviews, survey data and fieldwork observations with appropriate annotations, an interpretation, an artwork, archives, found objects, published texts or a manuscript, lab books, and data generated by machines and instruments."
university-of-the-west-of-england.md,## 3 General Principles
university-of-the-west-of-england.md,Research data is a valuable asset which is expensive to produce and sometimes cannot be reproduced. UWE Bristol therefore expects researchers to effectively manage research data.
university-of-the-west-of-england.md,"Researchers must make themselves aware of, and comply with relevant legislation and regulation, ethical requirements, contractual obligations and funder requirements, professional standards and University policies, as they apply to their research data, during the full research lifecycle."
university-of-the-west-of-england.md,"Researchers should apply appropriate measures to ensure research participants are protected during the full research data lifecycle, and must comply with both GDPR and the supplementary Data Protection Act 2018."
university-of-the-west-of-england.md,"UWE Bristol supports the principles of open research. Research data should be preserved and made available for sharing and re-use as quickly as possible, with as few restrictions as possible, when it is appropriate and safe to do so.  FAIR principles"
university-of-the-west-of-england.md,"(findable, accessible, interoperable, re-usable) should be considered as part of this process."
university-of-the-west-of-england.md,## 4 Policy/ Procedure/ Code of Practice
university-of-the-west-of-england.md,### 4.1 Researcher responsibilities
university-of-the-west-of-england.md,All researchers are required to familiarise themselves with this policy and the University’s research data management guidance.
university-of-the-west-of-england.md,"Researchers must comply with the following requirements, including making themselves aware of, and adhering to, relevant legislation and regulation, funders’ requirements and relevant University policies."
university-of-the-west-of-england.md,"The UWE Bristol Research Project Manager is responsible for ensuring that there is sound research data management practice in relation to the project. This includes the management of all research data collected, generated or used during a project. A research data management plan must be in place at the start of the research, before any work with research data takes place."
university-of-the-west-of-england.md,"Researchers are responsible for seeking, where possible, the direct costs of research data management, including the preparation of data for archiving, from their research funder. The resources necessary for the appropriate management of data throughout its life course should be set out in the Research Data Management Plan."
university-of-the-west-of-england.md,"Collaborative research involving partners outside the University should normally be the subject of a collaboration agreement, and the arrangements for management of research data must be clearly set out in the agreement."
university-of-the-west-of-england.md,"All research data is subject to the University’s Intellectual Property Policy, and intellectual property issues related to research data must be considered at the outset. Exclusive rights to research data must not be granted to a third party where this will restrict the ability to make the data openly available for re-use unless this is a condition of funding or of a collaboration agreement. The intellectual property rights of others in third party data being used for research must be respected. Commitments about IP, either explicit or implicit, must not be made in communications with companies or other external organisations (see the UWE guide on Intellectual Property and Research)."
university-of-the-west-of-england.md,"Researchers are responsible for complying with UWE’s data security requirements as outlined in UWE guidance, including the Information Security Toolkit, Research Data Security Guidance and Data Protection Guidance."
university-of-the-west-of-england.md,"o Research data should be actively managed throughout the research lifecycle to protect its integrity and security. Where research data is stored, it must be stored and backed up according to law and regulation, and UWE guidelines."
university-of-the-west-of-england.md,o Confidential data must only be stored on UWE approved systems. Other cloud hosted systems are not permitted for this purpose.
university-of-the-west-of-england.md,"o Researchers must use UWE managed devices, and UWE approved software solutions, to create, store or process restricted or confidential information."
university-of-the-west-of-england.md,"o Access to data should be controlled, and there should always be more than one appropriate person with access to the data."
university-of-the-west-of-england.md,"o Where data is collected, transported or stored off site, this must be strictly in accordance with UWE research data security guidance."
university-of-the-west-of-england.md,"o Where personal data (as defined by the Data Protection Act) is likely to cross international boundaries, the UWE Data Protection Office must be consulted."
university-of-the-west-of-england.md,"If the UWE Research Project Manager leaves the university, it is the responsibility of the Dean of School to ensure that an appropriate hand over of data takes place, and a new UWE Research Project Manager with responsibility for the data is immediately in place. In the absence of such an arrangement, the Dean of School will be deemed the Research Project Manager in relation to the data. Research Data may not be removed from UWE by a leaving staff member without the express permission in writing from the Dean of Faculty or the Pro Vice Chancellor Research and Enterprise, as appropriate."
university-of-the-west-of-england.md,#### Retention of research data
university-of-the-west-of-england.md,"Research data must be assessed for retention, according to the UWE Data Retention"
university-of-the-west-of-england.md,Schedule. Research data not selected for retention must be appropriately and securely
university-of-the-west-of-england.md,"destroyed in a timely way, and a record of its destruction made. o Destruction may need to take place because the research data is not deemed sufficiently valuable to warrant the costs of storing and supporting it. o Research data may also need to be destroyed where consents, or legal or regulatory requirements, mean that this is necessary."
university-of-the-west-of-england.md,#### Sharing and re-using research data
university-of-the-west-of-england.md,"The UWE Research Project Manager / PI is responsible for ensuring that all legal, ethical and contractual requirements are complied with in relation to third party access to data."
university-of-the-west-of-england.md,"Where safeguards can be set in place which will allow access, including where this is in line with participant consent and ethical approval, where this is in line with any legal or contractual obligations such as those relating to intellectual property and where data may be of use to others, it is the expectation that data will be made available for sharing and re-use."
university-of-the-west-of-england.md,"o Such research data will normally be preserved and made openly available within 12 months of completion of the project, with as few restrictions as possible on use by depositing it in an appropriate national or international archive, and/or the UWE data repository."
university-of-the-west-of-england.md,"o In relation to personal data, the retention period is governed by Data Protection legislation and this must be complied with, as well as complying with the terms of the original Participant Consent. Such research data can only be preserved if it is fully anonymised and cannot be linked back to research participants. Metadata to aid discovery of all research data, including any research data held in collaborating institutions, must be provided to the UWE Research Data repository within 12 months of the end of the project, whether or not it is deemed appropriate to be made publicly available."
university-of-the-west-of-england.md,"Where data is to be accessed by third parties via the UWE Research Data Repository, data documentation should be sufficient for the data to be understandable and reuseable."
university-of-the-west-of-england.md,"Where research data cannot be accessed by others for good reasons, the data may still need to be retained for potential verification of the integrity of the research or future use by the research team, or in compliance with regulation. This should be covered in the Research Data Management Plan. However, in relation to personal data, the retention period is governed by Data Protection legislation and this must be complied with, as well as complying with the terms of ethical approval and the original participant consent. Retention must always be considered on a case by case basis."
university-of-the-west-of-england.md,"Unless constrained otherwise, e.g. for reasons of sensitivity or commercial interest, researchers must include a data access statement in any publication based upon it. This should cite the research data and how to access it, where appropriate. Where it is inappropriate for the data to be made openly available, a reference must be made to the location of the metadata."
university-of-the-west-of-england.md,### 4.2 Postgraduate Research Student and Supervisor Responsibilities
university-of-the-west-of-england.md,"PGR students are expected to comply with the general requirements for storing, managing and sharing data as outlined above."
university-of-the-west-of-england.md,PGR students are advised to check the ownership of their data with the UWE IP team particularly where they are in receipt of funding.
university-of-the-west-of-england.md,"The Director of Studies, as UWE Research Project Manager, is responsible for ensuring that a research data management plan is in place for each PGR project under their management. This must be completed by the PGR, in consultation and partnership with, and approved by, the Director of Studies, and in consultation with the supervisory team and other UWE colleagues as necessary, by the time of the first progression exam. The plan should be reviewed at subsequent milestones."
university-of-the-west-of-england.md,"Research data relating to doctoral theses should be added to the UWE research data repository as part of the completion process, when it is appropriate and safe to do so. Such research data will be subject to an automatic 24 month embargo."
university-of-the-west-of-england.md,"Full requirements relating to the creation of research data management plans, and the deposit of research data to the UWE Research Data Repository, can be found in the Graduate School Handbook."
university-of-the-west-of-england.md,### 4.3 University responsibilities
university-of-the-west-of-england.md,"The University will provide the infrastructure, advice and training to support research data management, including mechanisms for the registration, storage, deposit and retention of research data throughout its life cycle."
university-of-the-west-of-england.md,"The University will preserve and provide access to research data, beyond the duration of a research activity and in accordance with specific retention requirements."
university-of-the-west-of-england.md,"The University will provide a research data repository to allow researchers to preserve their data, openly publish their data and enable access to their data when it is appropriate to do so."
university-of-the-west-of-england.md,The University will provide methods and procedures for controlled access to restricted data for approved researchers.
university-of-the-west-of-england.md,"Principles of findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR) data are promoted to all relevant research and support staff and other stakeholders"

university-of-the-west-of-scotland-uws.md,Following good research data management procedures provides several benefits to researchers:
university-of-the-west-of-scotland-uws.md,"Enhancing the visibility and impact of the individual’s and the University’s research Quicker results, as data is shared and reused"
university-of-the-west-of-scotland-uws.md,Facilitating interdisciplinary research
university-of-the-west-of-scotland-uws.md,Increasing transparency and ensuring validation of results
university-of-the-west-of-scotland-uws.md,Ensuring compliance with funders’ requirements.
university-of-the-west-of-scotland-uws.md,### Data management responsibilities
university-of-the-west-of-scotland-uws.md,"Researchers have a responsibility to take care of the data they collect while working and studying at the University, and to manage them in accordance with any relevant funders' policies. In particular, Researchers are required, wherever possible, to preserve and share data that supports published research findings by depositing them in a suitable data repository. The Principal Investigator (or the lead Researcher at UWS, in case of collaborative projects where the PI is based elsewhere) or research student, is responsible for the research data management and compliance to funders’ or regulatory agencies’ legislative or contractual obligations throughout the course of the project."
university-of-the-west-of-scotland-uws.md,"Researchers are responsible for ensuring that, when leaving the institution, a copy of the data produced under the auspices of the University is retained and appropriate appraisal decisions in relation to the retention, transference of ownership, or destruction of research data held in the University’s storage environments are made."
university-of-the-west-of-scotland-uws.md,"The line manager or Lead Supervisor is responsible to ensure that a new data owner is appointed, who can make curatorial decisions about the data (such as those relating to the deletion or migration of data). Ultimate responsibility lies with the Head of School."
university-of-the-west-of-scotland-uws.md,"The University’s role is to provide training, support and, where possible, mechanisms for deposit and funder-compliant storage of data."
university-of-the-west-of-scotland-uws.md,### Planning Data Collection and Data Management Plans
university-of-the-west-of-scotland-uws.md,"Every new research proposal should address any requirements related to the collection and use of data. This can be achieved by creating a data management plan (DMP). Where specifically required by funding bodies, the DMP should adhere to the funders’ requirements. Research data management roles and responsibilities should be clearly defined and documented within a research project. Where there are no specific funders’ requirements, the UWS data management template should be used. The template can be downloaded at"
university-of-the-west-of-scotland-uws.md,ed8RBrTdpzX_S-eMBkx5hd2P8XpbowvOUVpJHPA?e=uArCw5&CID=57F3DEEE5BA7-4875-8F30-35F1EB96AA54. More information on the requirements of funders and preparation of data management plans is provided by the Digital Curation Centre -
university-of-the-west-of-scotland-uws.md,"The PI or PG research student is responsible for ensuring that a DMP is completed for every project, kept up-to-date throughout the project, and complied with by all members of the project."
university-of-the-west-of-scotland-uws.md,### Data sharing
university-of-the-west-of-scotland-uws.md,"The University’s position is that data should be as open as it can be, to encourage reuse, and should be managed in accordance to the Principles set out in the UKRI Common Principles on Data Policy -   -, that 'publicly funded research data are a public good, produced in the public interest, which should be made openly available with as few restrictions as possible in a timely and responsible manner'."
university-of-the-west-of-scotland-uws.md,"There might be circumstances where restrictions need to be applied (e.g., third party content, sensitive data, confidentiality). Any access restrictions should be clearly stated and explained in the DMP."
university-of-the-west-of-scotland-uws.md,"Data must be accessible and well signposted. It is an expectation that the records containing metadata of research outputs on the University Repository will include links to the relevant datasets, wherever stored."
university-of-the-west-of-scotland-uws.md,"When a dataset has been deposited in a data repository or otherwise stored for preservation, the Researcher should register the details of the dataset with the University by contacting pure@uws.ac.uk, with the persistent identifier or DOI,  even if access to the data is restricted, so that a record of the data can be maintained and made available for discovery."
university-of-the-west-of-scotland-uws.md,### Data storage
university-of-the-west-of-scotland-uws.md,"During the life of the project, Researchers must ensure that dynamic data is stored securely, is organised effectively and is protected from loss. Researchers should use University-approved storage and follow the University’s procedures, in order to guarantee the security and integrity of research data and protect against loss or corruption."
university-of-the-west-of-scotland-uws.md,"Technical support requirements for the collection, storage and processing of research data should be considered at the planning stage. Information about data storage and other support for the management of research data provided by IT can be found at"
university-of-the-west-of-scotland-uws.md,"On completion of the project, data selected for archiving should be stored in a suitable data repository, that meets the stated criteria. The data repository chosen for depositing the archive data should allow deposit into additional repositories. Any external data repository selected must not charge any fee for access to the stored data. Where use of a specific data repository is mandated by the funder, Researchers must comply."
university-of-the-west-of-scotland-uws.md,A metadata record for all archive research data hosted internally and externally must be added to the University Repository. Researchers are advised to review the FAIR Principles -   - for guidance on the construction of appropriate metadata.
university-of-the-west-of-scotland-uws.md,"Research data selected for archiving should normally be preserved and accessible for a period of 10 years, but a longer period should be considered for projects of major clinical, social or environmental importance. Where a storage period is mandated by the funder, this should be adhered to as an absolute minimum."
university-of-the-west-of-scotland-uws.md,### Data rights
university-of-the-west-of-scotland-uws.md,"Unless mandated by the funder, exclusive rights to reuse and publish data must not be passed to commercial entities without retaining the rights to make the data openly available for reuse."
university-of-the-west-of-scotland-uws.md,Datasets should be assigned appropriate licences to state ownership and clarify data reuse. Creative Commons licences are strongly recommended.
university-of-the-west-of-scotland-uws.md,"The University reserves the right to keep a copy of the research data related to all research conducted under its auspices, even when Researchers responsible for the data leave the institution."

university-of-twente.md,## 1 INTRODUCTION
university-of-twente.md,"Good scientific practice is one of the main reasons to manage research data1 during and archive the data after the project. It is important to keep available the raw, processed and/or analyzed data, as well as the documentation necessary for understanding the data and the way it was collected, processed and analyzed. This plays an important role in accountability issues, and allows the researcher to reuse his/her own data or to return to earlier stages of the research process when needed. As a result, research will be reproducible and verifiable. Proper research data management (RDM) makes science more transparent, and improves scientific integrity and societal trust."
university-of-twente.md,"### Open Science, FAIR data"
university-of-twente.md,"More recently, Open Science and the wish to make optimal use of publicly-funded scientific publications and data developed into a second main reason for RDM. The results of research - publications and data- should be available for other scientists and for society. This favors both citizens and entrepreneurs, while researchers benefit in terms of funding and acknowledgement of impact in research evaluations."
university-of-twente.md,"As a general policy, research data underlying publications should be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Re-usable (FAIR, see appendix 1). This does not mean, however, that all data should be ‘open’. The basic principle is that data should be open to the public whenever possible and closed when needed. Closure, temporary closure (embargo) or limited/restricted access can be justified by, for instance, arrangements with research funders, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR, in Dutch: Algemene verordening gegevensbescherming, AVG), public safety, and/or intellectual property rights of third parties."
university-of-twente.md,"These insights are gradually translated and formalized in international, national and local policies and frameworks formulated by science institutions, research funding agencies, and policy makers (see appendix 2). In the Dutch National coalition agreement 2017, ‘Open science’ and ‘Open access’ are presented as normative."
university-of-twente.md,### New UT data policy
university-of-twente.md,"In 2015 the UT accepted the first version of a research data policy. Since that time the issue of the responsibility of universities for managing the research data they generate, obtain and (fully or partially) own has become more important. This is due to the growing attention to the proper handling of research data in scientific practice, the increasing amount of (digital) data, and the growing demand of integrity and open science. Therefore, the UT-data policy of 2015 is updated, resulting in this RDM policy, which pays more attention to the benefits of RDM for the researcher and gives more specifically defined instructions on good research data management at the UT."
university-of-twente.md,"The aim of this RDM policy is to stimulate the awareness of the need and benefits of good research data management (section 2) and offer clear rules for managing research data at the UT (section 3). Both sections are relevant for the main target group: the UT scientific community, e.g. researchers and research managers, who have the main responsibility of data management in research projects."
university-of-twente.md,"Besides, also general managers in the faculties and those who are involved in research data management support can benefit from this document, especially section 3."
university-of-twente.md,"This Research Data Management policy as well as practical information and general information about RDM, can be found at www.utwente.nl/researchsupport."
university-of-twente.md,## 2 WHAT BENEFITS CAN RDM BRING RESEARCHERS?
university-of-twente.md,"RDM can bring researchers several benefits, which can be categorized as follows:"
university-of-twente.md,1. Reputation and impact
university-of-twente.md,"Good RDM allows for the publishing of datasets and consequently its citation. This improves the visibility of your research and therefore its citation rate, reputation, and its scientific impact."
university-of-twente.md,"When citizen science is used for data collection, and open data are used by societal parties, societal impact is improved."
university-of-twente.md,More scientific and societal impact will lead to better results in research assessments and staff evaluations.
university-of-twente.md,"### 2. Quality, efficiency, safety and integrity"
university-of-twente.md,"Good RDM improves the quality of research. Your data are always accurate, complete, authentic and reliable. Making the data early and easy available to colleagues and reviewers, provides you with an extra quality check."
university-of-twente.md,"On the basis of your data, others can quite simply verify your results. Open data reduces the risk of manipulation."
university-of-twente.md,RDM reduces the risk of data loss by keeping your research data safe and secure.
university-of-twente.md,"After an initial investment in time, planning for your data management needs and"
university-of-twente.md,documenting your data throughout its life cycle can save you time and resources in the long run.
university-of-twente.md,Enabling other researchers to use your data or being able to use other researchers data prevents duplication of effort.
university-of-twente.md,"3. Reuse, new results and new collaborations"
university-of-twente.md,"You can benefit from findable and reusable high quality data collected by other researchers. Reuse and re-analysis of data make possible the testing of new or alternative hypotheses and methods of analysis; enables the exploration of topics not envisioned by the initial investigators; encourages diversity of analysis and opinion. Combining datasets from multiple sources through meta-analysis promotes new types of research and permits the creation of new data sets, information, and knowledge. Open data practices facilitate collaboration within and outside your discipline. This allows the crossing of boundaries of disciplines and institutions, and leads to co-publications."
university-of-twente.md,## 3 RDM POLICY AT THE UT
university-of-twente.md,As a general starting point the UT RDM policy implies that faculties and/or research groups
university-of-twente.md,"support the implementation of the FAIR-principles: Research data must be Findable,"
university-of-twente.md,"Accessible, Interoperable, and Re-usable (see appendix 1)"
university-of-twente.md,commit to the general principle that research data is classified as public data unless there are
university-of-twente.md,"specific requirements to maintain the confidentiality of research data, such as when a"
university-of-twente.md,researcher is bound to protect the confidential information of a collaborating company or
university-of-twente.md,when the data relates to human subjects
university-of-twente.md,stimulate awareness regarding RDM practices and develop a culture in which researchers are
university-of-twente.md,stimulated to and rewarded for sharing data
university-of-twente.md,include the provision of RDM-training and -support to researchers
university-of-twente.md,facilitate solid infrastructure and tools for storing and archiving research data both during
university-of-twente.md,and after the research
university-of-twente.md,monitor the development and execution of Data Management Plans (DMP)
university-of-twente.md,### Privacy regulations
university-of-twente.md,"When applicable, special attention must be given to handling with personal data. Specific RDM policies within a faculty must comply with the GDPR (in Dutch: AVG). For more information about privacy related issues, see:"
university-of-twente.md,1. UT privacy policy: www.utwente.nl/en/cyber-safety/cybersafety/legislation 2. UT privacy statement: www.utwente.nl/en/about-our-website 3. Privacy guidelines for research: www.utwente.nl/en/cybersafety/cybersafety/privacy/guideline-for-research/
university-of-twente.md,### Data management plan
university-of-twente.md,Good RDM starts with the writing of a data management plan . Most research funders require a DMP as part of funding application or to be handed in shortly after the start of the project. Specific RDM regulations in the faculty must describe the procedure about when and where a DMP has to be handed in and how reviewing and monitoring is organized.
university-of-twente.md,Every research project must have a DMP. The DMP can be derived from the specific RDM regulations and procedures at the nearest organizational level in the faculty.
university-of-twente.md,Every PhD-student follows the TGS-course Research Data Management as a preparation of the writing of a DMP.
university-of-twente.md,"The DMP has to be reviewed and monitored regularly, in line with planning and progress of the research project."
university-of-twente.md,### Data storage
university-of-twente.md,To prevent data loss during a research project research data and related materials must be stored properly.
university-of-twente.md,"All collected research data, including related materials (e.g. protocols, models or questionnaires), must be stored in the ISO 27001- and NEN 7510-certified facilities. Certified data storage"
university-of-twente.md,"facilities are offered by the UT-ICT services (LISA). If applicable, terms of use of data suppliers are leading."
university-of-twente.md,Personal cloud services must only be used for copies and comply with legal and contractual conditions. The preferred personal cloud service is Surfdrive. This service complies to the Dutch and European privacy legislation.
university-of-twente.md,"Storage of research data on portable devices must be avoided as much as possible, if needed should only be used for copies and must comply with legal and contractual conditions. Personal, confidential or classified research data and related materials, such as consent forms, must be stored in accordance with relevant Dutch legislation and European regulation and the VSNU Conduct code for the use of personal data in scientific research (UNL Code of conduct for using personal data in research [in Dutch]) for which UT-storage mentioned above is available. Non-digital research data and related materials, such as physical samples and lab notebooks, must be handled in accordance with clearly described procedures within the organisational unit and/or project."
university-of-twente.md,### Data documentation
university-of-twente.md,"In line with the FAIR principles data must be well documented, during the dynamic phase of the data and especially as soon as they have become static."
university-of-twente.md,"Research data and related materials, both digital and non-digital, must be accompanied by proper metadata and documentation in such a way that it enables the verification, replication and, if possible, reuse of the data. This documentation must also contain information about property rights and terms of use."
university-of-twente.md,### Data sharing
university-of-twente.md,"To guarantee that data can be accessed and checked during the research digital and/or non-digital research data and related materials must be shared. Implementation is dependent of intellectual property and responsibilities regarding research data, and the terms of use of data suppliers."
university-of-twente.md,"During the research project data and related materials must be shared in such a way that, apart from the researcher, it can be accessed by at least one other member of the organisational unit. Before the end of the project all research data and related materials which is needed for verification/replication and reuse, must be made available to the responsible in the"
university-of-twente.md,organisational unit (see also RDM roles and responsibilities).
university-of-twente.md,"Personal, confidential or classified research data and related materials, such as consent forms, must be shared in accordance with relevant Dutch legislation and European regulation and the VSNU Conduct code for the use of personal data in scientific research (UNL Code of conduct for using personal data in research [in Dutch]). The ISO 27001- and NEN 7510-certified projectand organization directory of the UT is recommended for secure sharing of personal data. In case of a Non-Disclosure Agreement with third parties, arrangements must be made about sharing data during the research."
university-of-twente.md,### Data archiving
university-of-twente.md,"For the purpose of verification, replication and reuse research data and related materials must be archived after the research project. Implementation is dependent of intellectual property and responsibilities regarding research data, and the terms of use of data suppliers"
university-of-twente.md,"Selection of research data and related materials for long-term preservation is based on what is needed for verification/replication and reuse. This must be at least the research data that form the basis of and can therefore be linked to publications. The selection to be archived can also comprise the full set of raw and/or processed data. In case of large data sets archiving costs, for both preparation and storage, should be taken into account when applying for project funding. Preferably during, but not later than 1 month after finishing the research selected data and related materials are archived in both group or faculty facilities and in a trusted repository, in accordance with FAIR-principles (see appendix 1) and, in compliance with legal and contractual conditions, openly accessible. The preferred archive for data from the technical and beta sciences is 4TU.ResearchData, and DANS for data from the social sciences."
university-of-twente.md,"Selected research data and related materials must be archived at least for 10 years, unless legal or contractual regulations demand another term."
university-of-twente.md,"Non-digital research data and related materials, such as physical samples or lab notebooks, must be archived in secure UT-provisions accompanied with clearly described access procedures. In case of a Non-Disclosure Agreement with third parties, arrangements must be made about archiving and sharing of data for verification and replication."
university-of-twente.md,"Archived research data and related materials, both digital and non-digital, are accompanied with proper metadata for findability and good documentation for reasons of interpretation and reusability (see also data documentation and data registration)."
university-of-twente.md,### Data registration
university-of-twente.md,"Because research data is becoming a valuable asset and in the near future will be formally recognized as scientific output, it is important to know what digital and/or non-digital research data and related materials have been created or used and where these are located."
university-of-twente.md,"In addition to archiving, all digital and/or non-digital research data and related materials must be registered and described by metadata, including a link or reference to the location of the digital or non-digital objects."
university-of-twente.md,The preferred system for registration of digital and/or non-digital research data and related materials is Pure Research Information because of automatic ingest of metadata from other systems (such as 4TU.ResearchData). Moreover these data and related materials can be linked to the registered UT publications based on them.
university-of-twente.md,## 4 RDM POLICY IMPLEMENTATION
university-of-twente.md,"Although dealing with research data may vary a lot per research discipline, the Executive Board has formulated this RDM policy as a framework of proper and responsible handling of research data. Faculties must implement this policy at one or more organizational levels (faculty, department, group and/or other unit) and supplement it with regulations and procedures related to the specific character or circumstances of the research discipline in question."
university-of-twente.md,RDM regulations and procedures in the faculty must be available on the relevant websites or intranet and communicated in such a way that every researcher can easily find these.
university-of-twente.md,### RDM roles and responsibilities
university-of-twente.md,"When implementing the UT RDM policy in the faculty it is important to identify and formalize RDM roles and responsibilities. This can comprise responsibilities like having and maintaining a RDM policy on one or more organizational levels in the faculty as well as monitoring the compliance to this policy. Also, operational RDM responsibilities must be addressed, like stimulating RDM awareness, the writing and monitoring of Data Management Plans (DMP), and the implementation and maintenance of necessary RDM facilities. An overview of RDM roles and responsibilities can be found in appendix 3."
university-of-twente.md,"In case of third party involvement, roles and responsibilities regarding research data management must be included in agreements. Good research data management is the shared responsibility of all parties involved. In principle, intellectual property rights on research data (“database right”) shall vest in UT."
university-of-twente.md,"In line with the university’s responsibility regarding RDM, support, infrastructure and facilities are offered by service department LISA. Specific RDM support, infrastructure and facilities can also be offered by faculties or other organizational units, in some cases in cooperation with LISA."
university-of-twente.md,## APPENDIX 1: FAIR PRINCIPLES
university-of-twente.md,### Preamble
university-of-twente.md,"One of the grand challenges of data-intensive science is to facilitate knowledge discovery by assisting humans and machines in their discovery of, access to, integration and analysis of, task-appropriate scientific data and their associated algorithms and workflows. Here, we describe FAIR - a set of guiding principles to make data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Re-usable."

university-of-westminster.md,### 1. Introduction
university-of-westminster.md,"The University of Westminster recognises that the good management of research data throughout the research lifecycle improves the transparency, integrity, reproducibility, and reach of scholarly research. Good research data management underpins the University’s strategic commitment to open research, which, in turn, is a key driver in achieving the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals’ call for public access to information for all (Goal 16, Target 10). The University’s Code of Research Good Practice formalises the importance of best practice in the management of research data and research related records to the University’s commitment to supporting “a research environment that is underpinned by a culture of integrity”.1 The University of Westminster’s Digital Strategy commits to ensuring that safe, secure, and compliant systems and processes exist for the collection, storage, sharing, and preservation of research data."
university-of-westminster.md,"In parallel, research funders and sponsors have clear policies relating to research data management and open research data. UKRI’s commitment to making publicly funded research data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable in line with the FAIR Data Principles is affirmed by the Common principles on research data (RCUK, 2011) and the Concordat on Open Research Data (HEFCE, UKRI, UUK, and Wellcome, 2016). Horizon Europe (European Commission, 2022) requires “open access to research data under the principle ‘as open as possible, as closed as necessary’”.2 It is recognised that researchers cannot meet open research data expectations without support from their institution."
university-of-westminster.md,Managing research data effectively:
university-of-westminster.md,increases the visibility and integrity of scholarly research;
university-of-westminster.md,maximises the utility and reusability of research data;

Researchers are strongly encouraged to link preserved datasets to their publication record using their author ORCiD.
university-of-westminster.md,"6.9 Researchers should make research data as open as possible, except in circumstances where there are valid reasons not to do so. Doctoral researchers are encouraged to share research data as openly as possible alongside their open access doctoral theses, except in circumstances where there are valid reasons not to do so. It is recognised that there may be legal, ethical, commercial, political, environmental, or cultural reasons for not sharing data, including but not restricted to personal data protection, copyright/ IP, and the protection of marginalised communities. It is also recognised, in line with The CARE Principles, that Indigenous Peoples hold the authority to make decisions about sharing Indigenous data."
university-of-westminster.md,"6.10 Researchers must include a data access statement in research outputs where mandated by a research funder, sponsor, or publisher, even where there are no research data associated with the output or the research data are inaccessible. Researchers are strongly recommended to include a data access statement in all research outputs, even where there are no research data associated with the output or the research data are inaccessible."
university-of-westminster.md,6.11 Researchers should establish an appropriate date (x-years post-project) at which to review preserved research data for further retention or destruction.

university-of-westminster.md,## Appendix A: Glossary
university-of-westminster.md,"A Data Access Statement, or Data Availability Statement, is a statement appended to a research publication that describes where the underlying research materials associated with a paper are available, and how they can be accessed, including any restrictions on access and reuse."
university-of-westminster.md,A Data Management Plan (DMP) is a formal document that describes how research data and materials will be managed or curated during and beyond the lifetime of a research project.
university-of-westminster.md,Digital preservation refers to the series of managed activities necessary to ensure continued access to digital materials. These actions include but are not limited to the appropriate selection and appraisal of research data and research related records for preservation.
university-of-westminster.md,"FAIR data are those research data which are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. FAIR data are not equivalent to open data, as research data can be FAIR even when access is restricted."
university-of-westminster.md,"Metadata are information that describes data. Metadata provide context and meaning to your research data or research materials and enable you and others to make sense of and reuse your data in the future. At a minimum, your documentation or metadata should clearly tell the story of how you created, gathered, and used your research data or research materials and for what purpose."
university-of-westminster.md,"Open data are those research data that are discoverable, publicly accessible, and reusable."
university-of-westminster.md,"A Persistent Identifier (PID) is a unique, stable, permanent reference to a digital object. PIDs include ORCiDs for authors, and DOIs for journal articles and datasets. They provide a reliable way to track citations and reuse, facilitating the discoverability and citation of research."
university-of-westminster.md,"Research data management (RDM) concerns the organisation of research data and materials throughout the research lifecycle. It includes “data collection or acquisition, organisation, curation, storage, (long-term) preservation, security, quality assurance, allocation of persistent identifiers (PIDs), provision of metadata in line with disciplinary requirements, licencing, and rules and procedures for sharing of data. RDM is an essential element in any project that generates, collects or re-uses data”.3"
university-of-westminster.md,"Research data are any digital object created or collected during the course of research. These might include documents, still images, video and audio files, spreadsheets, software, computer code, databases or websites, in addition to physical objects such as sketchbooks, diaries, lab notebooks, portfolios, models, other artefacts, and includes the documentation of practice based research."
university-of-westminster.md,"Research related records are physical or digital records created by a researcher in the course of research and relating to the administration, management, and delivery of research projects, activities and outputs. These may include consent forms, procedures, protocols, approvals, provenance information, laboratory notebooks, project reports, administrative or financial records, data management plans, primary datasets, databases, or samples."

It starts from the position that research data should be made openly accessible to others subject to legislation, ethical considerations, intellectual property rights and limitations set by any sponsor. The policy also establishes the responsibilities of the University in enabling the effective management of research data and for the longer term curation of this data."
university-of-worcester.md,The University seeks to align its approach to research data management with RCUK’s Common Principles on Data Policy and the Concordat on Open Research Data.
university-of-worcester.md,## Overview
university-of-worcester.md,This document is intended to set out how researchers should conduct themselves in managing their research data. It focuses on 6 key stages in the data management process: research data management planning; data generation/collection; data processing; data storage; data preservation; and data access. For each stage it establishes clear responsibilities for the researcher but also for the University to enable effective management and curation of research data.
university-of-worcester.md,"In terms of the University’s responsibilities as set out in this Policy, these are aspirational. A separate implementation plan will set out how it will meet these aspirations and the timescale for this. Further, in line with the policy, detailed guidance will be separately provided for researchers on each of the 5 stages drawing on good practice in the sector and the detailed guidance provided by the Digital Curation Centre, the UK Data Service and the UK Data Archive."
university-of-worcester.md,## Scope
university-of-worcester.md,"The policy applies to all staff and research students at the University engaged in research, and any individual who is not a member of staff or student at the University but is undertaking research using University premises and facilities, and/or in the University’s name. For the purpose of the policy, these groups are referred to collectively as “researchers”."

university-of-worcester.md,#### Data Management Planning
university-of-worcester.md,"2.4 Many funders now expect researchers to produce a data management plan as part of any application. It is good practice for all researchers to develop such a plan, whether applying for funding or not, although the scale and detail of the plan may vary dependent on the nature of the research."
university-of-worcester.md,2.5 Researchers are expected to:
university-of-worcester.md,Produce a data management plan which as a minimum identifies
university-of-worcester.md,o what data is to be collected
university-of-worcester.md,o how it will be collected
university-of-worcester.md,o how it will be stored during the project and in what form(s)
university-of-worcester.md,o ethical issues relating to collection and storage of the data (and how these will be addressed)
university-of-worcester.md,"o what will happen to the data at the end of the project, i.e. what will be retained, what will be disposed of"
university-of-worcester.md,o ethical issues relating to retention of data (and how these will be addressed)
university-of-worcester.md,o how retained data will be stored and in what form
university-of-worcester.md,o how others may gain access to retained data Share the data management plan with other researchers on the project for comment and revision as appropriate

university-of-worcester.md,2.9 The University will:
university-of-worcester.md,"Provide support, guidance and training for researchers (appropriate to their experience) in methodology, ethics and integrity."
university-of-worcester.md,#### Processing Data
university-of-worcester.md,"2.10 The “raw” data generated through research is normally subject to some form of processing. It may be entered into a database, digitised, transcribed, transliterated or translated. During this process it may be checked and cleaned; it may be subject to annotation and in some instances anonymisation."
university-of-worcester.md,2.11 It is essential that data is processed to the highest possible standards to ensure the integrity and quality of the data.
university-of-worcester.md,2.12 Researchers are expected to:
university-of-worcester.md,"Produce processed data that is accurate, complete, authentic and reliable;"
university-of-worcester.md,Process data ensuring that all ethical requirements are met.
university-of-worcester.md,2.13 The University will:
university-of-worcester.md,"Provide support, guidance and training for researchers (appropriate to their experience) in processing data."
university-of-worcester.md,#### Data Storage
university-of-worcester.md,"2.14 All data generated in the course of a research project, both processed and unprocessed, should normally be stored securely and safely. This is a legislative requirement for personal data but it is recommended that all data is treated in this manner to ensure the integrity of that data. However, there may be contexts where this is neither practicable nor desirable, e.g. where the “data” generated are artefacts such as sculptures or paintings presented in a public space."
university-of-worcester.md,2.15 Researchers are expected to:
university-of-worcester.md,"Store all data, unprocessed and processed, whether digital or in some other form, securely and safely for the lifetime of the project unless there is a clear rationale why this is not possible or desirable"
university-of-worcester.md,"Use digital storage that is fit for purpose, both in terms of its security and its size - for this reason the robust, managed storage provided by the University is the recommended option Back up all digital data and hold copies of data in other forms as far as that is possible and practicable on a regular basis"
university-of-worcester.md,2.16 The University will:
university-of-worcester.md,Provide appropriate digital storage options and where appropriate hard storage options for
university-of-worcester.md,researchers
university-of-worcester.md,Provide detailed guidance on legislative requirements for storage of data
university-of-worcester.md,Provide detailed guidance on storage options
university-of-worcester.md,#### Data Preservation
university-of-worcester.md,2.17 High quality research data are a public good and therefore should be preserved and made accessible to others unless there is a clear reason not to. Reasons include but are not limited to:
university-of-worcester.md,Consent for participation was subject to data not being preserved
university-of-worcester.md,"Ethical considerations, such as need to ensure anonymity, argue against preserving the data"
university-of-worcester.md,The data is insufficiently robust or meaningful to warrant preservation
university-of-worcester.md,The data does not have long-term value
university-of-worcester.md,"2.18 The length of time data must be preserved may be determined by a funder; where this time period is not defined by the funder or the research is unfunded, it is recommended that data is preserved for a minimum of 10 years."
university-of-worcester.md,"2.19 It may not be practicable or appropriate to preserve all data generated or processed in the course of a project and decisions will need to be made as to what data should be preserved. This decision should be in accordance with any legal, ethical, funder or collaborator requirements. Keeping these requirements in mind, preserved data should allow a clear assessment of any published work arising from the research."
university-of-worcester.md,2.20 Researchers are expected to:
university-of-worcester.md,"Identify if, how and for how long data will be preserved at the planning stage and"
university-of-worcester.md,communicate this to participants;
university-of-worcester.md,"Preserve appropriate data that belongs to the University (subject to any legal, ethical, funder or collaborator requirements and the exclusions in 2.17);"
university-of-worcester.md,"Preserve appropriate data that belongs to the funder (subject to any legal, ethical, funder or collaborator requirements and the obligations set out in the contract or research"
university-of-worcester.md,agreement);
university-of-worcester.md,Transfer digital data to a suitable file format to ensure that it is accessible in the long term; this will often mean using non-proprietary file formats
university-of-worcester.md,Migrate data to a suitable repository; this may be a University repository and/or an external data repository (general or subject-based).
university-of-worcester.md,2.21 The University will:
university-of-worcester.md,Provide detailed guidance on data preservation including information about appropriate file formats Develop systems to enable its researchers to preserve data for the required period
university-of-worcester.md,### Data Sharing
university-of-worcester.md,2.22 Research data are preserved so that outputs from the research can be assessed against this data but also so that this data can be re-used by others.
university-of-worcester.md,2.23 It is important that preserved data is easily discoverable and that it is accompanied by sufficient metadata to enable other researchers to understand the research and re-use potential of the data.
university-of-worcester.md,2.24 Researchers are expected to:
university-of-worcester.md,"Produce metadata and documentation to describe the data (sufficient to understand what research data exists, why, when and how it was generated), to identify who owns the data"
university-of-worcester.md,"and where it is archived, and to set out how the data can be accessed and any restrictions on access."
university-of-worcester.md,2.25 The University will:
university-of-worcester.md,"Create a catalogue of data produced by its researchers including this metadata, to include a direct link to this data where this is appropriate and possible (e.g. through a digital object identifier)."

In addition, the Open Access Strategy of the University of Bayreuth8 and the University of Bayreuth’s Strategy for Handling Intellectual Property (IP) in Knowledge and Technology Transfer9 needs to be observed as well."
universität-bayreuth.md,### 1. Scope of validity
universität-bayreuth.md,"The RDM Policy is aimed at all researchers at the University of Bayreuth. RDM at the University of Bayreuth is carried out in accordance with the applicable laws on the protection of persons and intellectual property, as well as the ""Statutes of the University of Bayreuth for safeguarding the standards of good scientific practice and handling scientific misconduct""7 and is subject to specific agreements with third parties. The Policy is supplemented by the ""Guidelines for Research Data Management at the University of Bayreuth""10 ."
universität-bayreuth.md,"In the case of research collaborations, this RDM Policy is valid unless equivalent or stricter regulations are applied. If a project-specific policy is developed as part of a research project that contains equivalent or stricter regulations, it takes precedence over this RDM Policy."
universität-bayreuth.md,### 2. Legal and ethical aspects
universität-bayreuth.md,Copyright law guarantees the protection of intellectual property. Whether research data are subject to the protection of copyright law depends on whether the requirements for the level of intellectual creation or the requirements of database copyright are met.
universität-bayreuth.md,"Intellectual property rights and rights to research data are generally defined by specific agreements (e.g. work agreements, grant agreements, consortium agreements, or agreements of contract research)."
universität-bayreuth.md,"In the area of RDM, the University of Bayreuth and its researchers observe the applicable laws for the protection of persons and intellectual property (General Data Protection Regulation, copyright law) as well as ethical, legal, and confidentiality concerns (e.g. patent law). In particular, this includes any type of collection and processing11 of personal data, which is only carried out if"
universität-bayreuth.md,the person concerned has given their consent to the collection or processing of their personal data for one or more specific purposes;
universität-bayreuth.md,"data collection or processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the person concerned is party, or in order to take steps at the request of the person concerned prior to entering into a contract; data collection or processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the responsible person is subject;"
universität-bayreuth.md,data collection or processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the person concerned or of another natural person;
universität-bayreuth.md,data collection or processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the responsible person.
universität-bayreuth.md,### 3. Handling research data
universität-bayreuth.md,"Throughout the entire research data cycle - from data acquisition to publication and long-term availability - research data should be handled and documented in accordance with the established and recognized rules and standards in the respective subject area. In accordance with the FAIR principles12, research data should be findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable."
universität-bayreuth.md,"All researchers at the University of Bayreuth determine within the legal framework when and under what conditions their research data will be made accessible. The University of Bayreuth recommends that its members work towards making research data and software created in the research process, as well as scientific publications, publicly accessible as early as possible in accordance with the statement of the G8 science ministers dated 12 June 201313, the information sheet ""Research Data Management"" of the priority initiative Digital Information of the Alliance of German Science Organizations14, and the Open Access Strategy of the University of Bayreuth15. To this end, the scope, timing, and appropriate licensing conditions for research data must be defined in accordance with intellectual property rights and on the condition that no third-party rights, statutory provisions, data rights, or other property rights conflict with this."
universität-bayreuth.md,"Research data should be stored with suitable metadata in a trustworthy, subject-specific repository or data centre/archive system or the institutional research data repository of the University of Bayreuth RDSpace@UBT16 for the long term and made as openly accessible as possible. To ensure long-term citability of research data, the use of persistent identifiers (e.g. DOI) is recommended. This makes the origin of reused data traceable, and the data source or the data provider can be credited."
universität-bayreuth.md,"Research data and documents that ensure the documentation and reproducibility of the results should be stored and kept accessible for as long as is necessary in accordance with legal requirements or the requirements of research funders within the framework of the applicable legal and contractual provisions. The minimum retention period for research data and documents is 10 years after publication by assignment of a DOI. As a rule, research data should be kept for at least 10 years after publication of the research findings or after completion of the research project (whichever is the later)."
universität-bayreuth.md,"If research data and associated documents are to be deleted or destroyed after the retention period has expired, or for legal or ethical reasons, these measures need to take legal and ethical considerations into account. The deletion must be documented and justified. When deciding whether to retain or delete data, the interests and contractual provisions of third-party funders and other parties, in particular contributors and cooperation partners, must be taken into account. Aspects of security and confidentiality must be considered."

universität-bayreuth.md,"Researchers are all members of the University of Bayreuth who are actively conducting research. In addition to academic staff, this also includes students and non-academic staff, insofar as they are active in research."
universität-bayreuth.md,"The term also includes persons who are not directly affiliated with the University of Bayreuth, but who use the facilities and infrastructure of the University of Bayreuth for research projects. This group of persons includes visiting researchers, freelance staff, scholarship holders, cooperation partners, and persons who are pursuing a doctoral or postdoctoral thesis supervised by a member of the University of Bayreuth, even if they are not members of the University of Bayreuth themselves."
universität-bayreuth.md,#### Research data
universität-bayreuth.md,"All data that are generated, collected, observed, simulated, or derived in the research process are regarded as research data. Typical examples of research data are measurement data, laboratory values, audiovisual information, texts, survey results, objects from collections, methodological test procedures or simulations, source code, and protocols. The range of data types reflects the diversity and methodological development of scientific disciplines and research procedures. Research data can arise in various forms during the research project (different format variants of primary data, processed data including negative or ambiguous results, shared data, published data) and can be provided with different access authorizations, e.g. as open, restricted, or non-public data. For the provision and subsequent use of research data, it is necessary to document the context in which the data were generated and to document (as metadata) the tools and methods used in this process."
universität-bayreuth.md,Research data management
universität-bayreuth.md,"Research data management encompasses all measures for the quality assurance of research data during their life cycle; from the planning and implementation of the research project, to the generation, documentation and processing of data, to the assigning of metadata, to data storage during the research project, and to long-term data storage after the research has been completed. RDM also sets out how accountability, completeness, authenticity, integrity, confidentiality, publication, registration, and access to data are ensured and managed."
universität-bayreuth.md,#### Metadata
universität-bayreuth.md,"Metadata is descriptive or contextual information about the associated primary research data. Metadata can be indexed, making it easier to archive and find the described data. Metadata can be divided into different categories. Repositories distinguish, for example"
universität-bayreuth.md,"- bibliographic metadata (e.g. title, author, abstract),"
universität-bayreuth.md,"- structural metadata (relationships between objects; e.g. references, versions),"
universität-bayreuth.md,"- administrative metadata (authorizations/status; e.g. access authorizations, embargo), and - technical metadata (data analyzed by the system; e.g. file size and format, checksums, modification date)."

universität-des-saarlandes.md,## Preamble
universität-des-saarlandes.md,"Structured research data management is one of the central elements of good scientific practice1 and is an important part of open science. Saarland University and its researchers, lecturers and students are committed to the adequate handling of research data in accordance with FAIR principles2 throughout the entire data life cycle from data generation to archiving."
universität-des-saarlandes.md,## Definition
universität-des-saarlandes.md,"Research data within the meaning of this policy is understood to mean both genuinely digital data that is collected, generated or obtained during or as a result of research work (which includes, but is not limited to, conducting field or laboratory experiments, conducting experiments, surveys, interviews or the analysis of data), as well as data that are generated in analogue formats or already exist and are digitized in further processing. Research data also includes those data that document the actual data generation and ensure the reproducibility of the data (metadata)."
universität-des-saarlandes.md,"Due to the range of disciplines, the resulting research data is heterogeneous with respect to the data types and formats; these can consist, for example, of text modules, survey data, measurement, observation data, databases, questionnaires, protocols, audio data and audio-visual data, as well as simulation data and software source code, provided that this is a central result of scientific research. Here, the data life cycle of research data can have various stations which differ in terms of quality states or processing statuses and are fundamentally classified as open, access-restricted and nonpublic research data depending on their access authorizations. Research data management deals with the organization and documentation of the data, storage, archiving, data security, the protection of personal data as well as publication and sharing with third parties. Adequate and sustainable research data management not only ensures the increased requirements of many third-party funding providers are met as well as developing standards from specialist disciplines taking into account research ethical principles, but also increases the visibility of scientific research and the potential linking of different data sets through the subsequent use of data by researchers."
universität-des-saarlandes.md,### 1 Scope
universität-des-saarlandes.md,"This policy is aimed at all researchers, lecturers and students at Saarland University. It applies equally to all persons who conduct research at Saarland University or on its behalf or who use facilities of Saarland University. Any requirements of third-party funding providers with regard to research data management that deviate from this policy shall take precedence. In addition, the regulations of Saarland University regarding data protection and IT security are binding. Laws and regulations relating to the handling of research data, in particular regulations for safeguarding good scientific practice, copyright and related rights, commercial intellectual property rights (patent law) and data protection, remain unaffected and take precedence over the regulations of this policy."
universität-des-saarlandes.md,### 2 Research data management
universität-des-saarlandes.md,#### 2.1 Management of research data
universität-des-saarlandes.md,"Research data management covers the entire life cycle of the research data, from data generation to archiving or re-use and includes both the organization and documentation of the generated data, as well as the storage, backup and accessibility (publication) of the data. Adequate research data management ensures that the data can be processed and interpreted in the context of the research project."
universität-des-saarlandes.md,"Sustainable research data management begins before the actual data generation in the context of the creation of a data management plan that takes into account all the necessary resources for both the storage and the management of the data. In particular, the project-related physical storage media must be described in full, including software solutions that are used here, and also any personnel costs or license fees. Where personal data are processed, they must be anonymized or pseudonymized as soon as the research purpose allows. In the case of pseudonymization, the characteristics with which the personal reference can be restored must be stored separately from the research data. In addition, the data management plan contains information on project managers, the use and publication of the data and agreements on authorship and copyright. During the course of the research project, the data management plan is regularly reviewed and, if necessary, updated. Responsibility for the entire research data management as well as the preparation and regular review of the data management plan lies with the respective project managers."
universität-des-saarlandes.md,"This data management plan must already be drawn up for many funding applications from thirdparty funding providers and submitted upon application, for example under the Horizon 2020 programme . Even without these binding requirements from third parties, Saarland University strongly recommends the early implementation of a suitable storage structure, long-term storage and accessibility of research data and their documentation in a data management plan."
universität-des-saarlandes.md,#### 2.2 Storage and publication of research data
universität-des-saarlandes.md,"In the (long-term) storage of research data, it is important to determine which data should be stored at which quality level, whereby reasons for not storing research-relevant data must be documented in writing in accordance with the principles of good scientific practice. After metadata has been attributed, the data should be stored in sustainable, lossless and open data formats on data storage devices and backed up."
universität-des-saarlandes.md,"Saarland University supports researchers in ensuring the broadest possible visibility of their research, as well as the subsequent use of the data. Therefore, the metadata of the research project should always be provided with a unique persistent identifier, for example a DOI. The primary data can also be retrieved and stored in a subject-specific repository. When selecting the publication medium, it is recommended that the data is kept freely available for scientific purposes. This can be done by issuing open licenses for usage rights (e.g. Creative Commons CC-BY for data or GNU Affero General Public License for (software) source code). All data collected must be kept in accordance with the specifications of the sponsors and at least for a period of ten years from the publication of the data or from the date of project completion in accordance with the rules of good scientific practice.  For clinical studies, additional retention periods apply which must be observed accordingly."
universität-des-saarlandes.md,### 3 Commencement
universität-des-saarlandes.md,This policy on research data and research data management was adopted by the Senate of Saarland University in its 15th session on 18 January 2023 and will enter into force the day after its publication in the Saarland University Gazette.

universität-graz.md,### 2. Scope
universität-graz.md,"This Policy for the management of research data applies to all researchers working at the University of Graz. In cases when research is funded by a third party, any agreements made with that party concerning intellectual property rights, exploitation rights, access rights and the storage of research data will take precedence over the provisions of this Policy. This Policy will be reviewed every three years under the supervision of the Vice Rector for Research and updated as necessary."
universität-graz.md,### 3. Rights Ownership
universität-graz.md,"Intellectual property rights (IPR) are defined in the Copyright Act (UrhG) and the University Act 2002 (UG 2002) and may be further elaborated in researchers’ employment contracts with the University of Graz. IPR may also be further defined in additional guidelines and agreements (e.g. grant or consortium agreements). In cases where the IPR belong to the University of Graz, the University has the right to choose how data are published and shared."
universität-graz.md,### 4. Principles of Research Data Management
universität-graz.md,"Research data should be stored in and made available for use through a suitable repository or archiving system and should be provided with persistent identifiers. When depositing data in a repository, researchers are requested to declare their affiliation in accordance with the Affiliation Guidelines of the University of Graz."
universität-graz.md,"Preserving the integrity of research data requires that these be stored in a correct, complete, unadulterated and reliable manner. Furthermore, they must be findable, accessible, traceable, interoperable and available for subsequent reuse in accordance with the FAIR principles whenever possible. The stored data shall be dated and, where possible, subsequent changes should be stored separately from the original data."
universität-graz.md,"When dealing with personal data, the applicable data protection regulations must be observed. Provided this is not prohibited by any third party rights, legal obligations, ethical considerations or rights of ownership, research data should be assigned a licence for open use."
universität-graz.md,"The minimum period for which research data and records must be archived is 10 years after the assignment of a persistent identifier or the publication of related work after completion of the research activity, whichever is later. The administrative documents accompanying the research activities must also be archived."
universität-graz.md,All legal and ethical considerations must be taken into account whenever research data or records are earmarked for deletion or destruction and this must then proceed in a standardised manner. Principal Investigators or their legal successors must be informed and an offer must be made to transfer the data to them. Any action taken must be documented and be accessible for future audit.
universität-graz.md,### 5. Responsibilities
universität-graz.md,Responsibility for research data management during and after a research activity lies with the University of Graz and its researchers.
universität-graz.md,#### 5.1 Responsibilities of the University

universität-graz.md,"a) submitting and updating data management plans (DMPs) for research activities and ensuring registration of and compliance with these. DMPs should describe the following aspects in particular: collecting data, documenting, assigning metadata, archiving, access to and storage of or proper deletion of research data and research-related records. The Principle Investigators are primarily responsible for research data management based on a sound research data management plan."
universität-graz.md,"b) planning for possible future uses of the data. This includes defining usage rights and assigning appropriate licences. In particular, rights to re-use or publish research data should not be transferred to third parties, such as commercial publishers or agents, without preserving the rights for open access to and free use of the data."
universität-graz.md,c) storing research data in a repository by no later than the date of completion of the research project.
universität-graz.md,"d) complying with all organisational, regulatory, institutional and other contractual and legal requirements."
universität-graz.md,e) managing research data and data sets in accordance with the principles and requirements expressed in this Policy.
universität-graz.md,### Annex: Definitions
universität-graz.md,"Research is defined as any creative and systematically performed work that is carried out with the goal of advancing knowledge, including gaining insights about people, culture and society, and applying this knowledge in new ways."
universität-graz.md,"Researchers are individuals who perform research activities at the University of Graz. This includes members of the University as defined in Section 94 of the Universities Act 2002 (UG), i.e. employed staff and doctoral students in their role as early career researchers, as well as individuals who are not affiliated with the University of Graz. Guest researchers and collaborators are also expected to comply with this Policy."
universität-graz.md,"Research data, as used in this Policy, refers to all data produced by researchers in the context of their work that would be considered by members of the profession to be relevant for the replication of results, suitable for reuse by fellow researchers, and for which the University of Graz has curatorial responsibility. In a broader sense, research data includes all information (regardless of form or presentation) that is required to support or validate the development, outcome, observations or findings of a research project and its context. This includes materials of any type created in the course of academic activities, e.g. through digitisation, recordings, studies of source materials, experiments, measurements, surveys or interviews. This also includes software and code. Research data may exist in a range of different forms. Data can pass through various phases over the course of their lifecycle: from raw data, processed data (including “negative” or “inconclusive results”) and shared data to published data and Open Access published data. They can also have different degrees of accessibility (Open Data, Restricted Data, Closed Data)."
universität-graz.md,"(Research Data) Repositories are managed servers for storing, describing, archiving and publishing digital objects and data. One global registry of research data repositories across all academic disciplines is re3data.org."
universität-graz.md,"A persistent identifier is a permanent reference to a document, file, web page or other object. It allows access to a digital object via a persistent link. Examples of persistent identifiers include Digital Object Identifiers (DOI) and Uniform Resource Names (URN)."
universität-graz.md,"The “FAIR Data Principles” lay down guidelines that sustainably reusable research data must fulfil and that research data infrastructures should implement within the framework of the services they provide. According to the FAIR principles, data should be ""Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable""."
universität-graz.md,"A Principal Investigator is an individual responsible for taking binding decisions and who oversees the funding and expenditures for a particular research project or activity, or a project’s lead researcher."
universität-graz.md,"Free licences: A licence is a set of legal terms attached to an original work that serve as an extension of copyright. It defines what may and may not be done with a work, grants permissions, and specifies restrictions. An open or free licence, such as a Creative Commons licence, essentially allows access, reuse and redistribution of a work with few or no restrictions. The precise permissions depend on the full text of the licence being applied."
universität-graz.md,"A Data Management Plan (DMP) is a structured guideline (document or online tool) which depicts the entire lifecycle of the data and which can be updated as needed. Data management plans must ensure that research data are traceable, available, authentic, citable and properly stored and that they comply with clearly defined legal parameters and appropriate measures for subsequent use. Ideally, DMPs should be delivered in a machine-actionable format."
universität-graz.md,"Metadata are data about data that describe characteristics and properties of objects, works and information."
universität-graz.md,"Scientific integrity and good scientific practice: Scientific integrity is understood as a comprehensive ethical awareness in the sense of a culture of honesty and responsibility for quality in science. According to the Austrian Agency for Research Integrity Guidelines for Good Scientific Practice (2015), the standards of good scientific practice include, among other things, precise recordkeeping and documentation of the scientific process as well as the results to ensure that the research is reproducible. This includes the collection of primary and original data (processed raw material), in a manner that is transparent, seamlessly recorded and documented. Where they serve as the basis for publications, these data and documents (e.g. laboratory notes) are to be stored on durable, backed-up data media in the research institution where they were generated, with due attention paid to the retention periods applicable to the specific field of research wherever necessary for the purpose of ensuring the verifiability of the method selected and the findings generated. This includes ensuring that access to data is as open as possible, as restricted as necessary and, where appropriate, in accordance with the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data management principles. Reference is also made to the University of Graz document Grundsätze zur Sicherung guter wissenschaftlicher Praxis und zur Vermeidung von Fehlverhalten in der Wissenschaft [Principles for Ensuring Good Scientific Practice and Avoiding Misconduct in Science] (2004)."
universität-jena.md,Guidelines and recommendations on research data management at the Friedrich Schiller University Jena
universität-jena.md,20 december 2016
universität-jena.md,# Preface
universität-jena.md,At the Friedrich Schiller University Jena (FSU) research data are regarded an essential resource for gaining scientific insights. The FSU strives to support its members with suitable research data management services. These services are provided by the central service facilities and will be continuously evaluated and enhanced.
universität-jena.md,"The present guidelines and recommendations supplement and specify the principles formulated in the ""Policy on the handling of research data at the Friedrich Schiller University Jena"". The Research Data Management Helpdesk serves as a central point of contact for all matters relating to research data. The website of the helpdesk1 provides the most recent information."
universität-jena.md,## I. Planning phase: before the research project
universität-jena.md,"While planning a research activity in which data are collected or where data form the basis of your research, it is highly recommended to examine the requirements and possibilities for efficient and sustainable research data management from early on. The Research Data Management Helpdesk is there to assist you in determining your individual requirements, find out about services and funding opportunities, and to develop a suitable strategy for your project."
universität-jena.md,"The Service center for research and transfer2 provides general advice on proposals for third-party funding. Coordinated programs of the DFG (e.g. SFBs, research groups) are supported by the office of the Vice-President for Research3."
universität-jena.md,"It is recommended, and also required by some funding organisations, to create and submit a data management plan (DMP). A DMP contains the requirements as well as the technical and organisational measures ensuring a sustainable handling of research data during, and after, the project life-time. Throughout a project the DMP serves as a reference and guideline. It may evolve over time if conditions or requirements change (keyword: living document)."
universität-jena.md,"Most funding organisations expect not only the long-term safekeeping of research data but also its publication. A suitable strategy should be determined in the proposal phase. Costs for research data management (e.g. labour, storage, publication), which cannot be covered by the university's basic facilities, should be requested in the proposal. The university computer centre assists you in determining the necessary IT infrastructure and services."
universität-jena.md,"While planning a research project, in particular, when publishing results, legal constraints apply and must be taken into account. Certain research data in the social sciences, life sciences and medicine, for example, are subject to strict conditions, such as privacy protection laws or require prior assessment by an ethics committee. Additionally, the protection of copyrights and legitimate interests of third parties must be ensured. It is recommended to clarify legal questions in advance while planning a research project. The legal department4 is there to advise you on these matters."
universität-jena.md,## II. Implementation phase: during the research project
universität-jena.md,"Storing and processing, as well as collaborating on research data, should adhere to state-of-the-art IT principles. This includes, first and foremost, securing data in terms of accessibility, integrity (unaltered) and authenticity. For example, procedures for data backups and archiving need to be in place and secure data exchange platforms and versioning tools should be used."
universität-jena.md,In terms of research data the university computer centre (URZ)5 provides (among other things) the following services. The services are offered partly free of charge as basic infrastructure or can be provided at net cost.
universität-jena.md,use of network file systems (including data backup)
universität-jena.md,mass storage (archive storage) including data mirroring
universität-jena.md,renting virtual servers (server hosting)
universität-jena.md,accommodation of real servers (server housing)
universität-jena.md,block storage services for servers (virtual disks via a dedicated storage
universität-jena.md,network)
universität-jena.md,data exchange services
universität-jena.md,versioning services
universität-jena.md,long-term archiving services (in cooperation with ThULB)
universität-jena.md,Detailed service descriptions are available on the URZ website.
universität-jena.md,"The reusability of research data is largely dependent on the availability and quality of accompanying metadata. Metadata is data about data and provides the context in which the data were created. As a rule of thumb, metadata should answer the classic six questions: Who? What? Why? How? When? Where? Metadata is a prerequisite enabling potential users to find data and assess its suitability for the intended use. Ideally, the description is structured and machine-readable. For this purpose, metadata standards and standardized terminologies exist in most disciplines. If these do not exist, generic standards, such as Dublin Core, MARC, or MODS, should be used."
universität-jena.md,"In the implementation phase of a project, datasets may evolve over several stages (e.g. by selection, aggregation, integration). It is good practice to label, document and keep the different versions at least for the duration of the project. Especially in the case of text-based data, the use of versioning tools (e.g. git, SVN) helps with the management of different versions."
universität-jena.md,"In collaborative projects or projects with large amounts of data, the use of dedicated software and infrastructure for data management is advisable. Operating these infrastructures usually requires additional resources, but they provide the advantage of a streamlined central management for research data. Finding and sharing research data is thereby facilitated, but should be governed by a data policy the project consortium agreed upon."
universität-jena.md,## III. Final phase: after completion of the research project
universität-jena.md,"According to good scientific practice, research data must be archived and made available by the end of a project. In particular, public access has become a necessity in recent years in order to facilitate the traceability of research results as well as subsequent reuse of the data. It is recommended to publish research data following the principle ""as open as possible, as restricted as necessary""."
universität-jena.md,"There are various ways to publish research data. In addition to domain-agnostic repositories, a large number of discipline-specific repositories exist. To find a suitable repository for your research data, the portal re3data.org 6  provides extensive search and filter capabilities. In addition, there are special data journals for publishing research data. In some disciplines it is common practice to publish data as a supplement to the respective article. However, this form of data publication has the disadvantage that the data can only be found via the article and does not form an independent, citable publication object"
universität-jena.md,"When selecting a publication method, the following criteria should be taken into account: long-term availability (at least 10 years), allocation of persistent identifiers (e.g. DOI, URN), licensing and usage terms of the data, visibility and cost."
universität-jena.md,"As a member of the FSU, you may publish and archive research data with the Digital Library of Thuringia (DBT)7."
universität-jena.md,"If you published research data with an external repository, you are requested to register this publication with the Digital Library Thuringia, too."
universität-jena.md,"Individual websites (e.g. of projects, departments, employees) are generally not suitable for the publication of research data. The long-term availability of such websites is often not guaranteed and non-ambiguous identification (keyword: PID) and cross-referencing is limited."
universität-jena.md,"When selecting the data to be published, the DFG (2015) recommends, ""Data should be made accessible at a stage of processing that allows it to be usefully reused by third parties (raw data or structured data)."" In particular, data that served as the foundation of a scientific article should be made public."
universität-jena.md,"As with scientific articles, research data should also receive a unique, persistent identifier (PID). A PID (e.g. DOI, URN) is typically provided by the repository or data journal at the time of publication. In order to mandate usage and exploitation rights of your research data, data should always be published with a corresponding license. The selected license should allow at least open access for scientific purposes. Specific requirements of the funding organisation or repositories may apply and need to be considered. Suitable data licenses are available from Open Data Commons8 or the Creative Commons9. In general, research data should be published as soon as possible. However, there may be reasons to publish research data with an embargo period. In this case, the data is submitted to the repository for archiving, but it is only accessible after the end of the embargo period. The researchers who are responsible for the data determine the length of the embargo period, unless otherwise requested by the policies and guidelines of funding organisations or the repositories. Embargo periods should not exceed 1-2 years after the end of the project."
universität-jena.md,Vorstehende Handlungsempfehlung wurde am 20. Dezember 2016 durch den Senat der Friedrich-Schiller-Universität Jena beschlossen.

universität-rostock.md,# Research Data Policy of the University of Rostock
universität-rostock.md,## Preamble
universität-rostock.md,"Quality-assured research data is a cornerstone of scientific knowledge that can be used on multiple occasions as the basis for further research, irrespective of its original purpose. Sustainable storage and provision of research data therefore not only helps verify earlier results, but is also significantly important for attaining future results with the goal of improving the quality, productivity and competitiveness of science, and forms a fundamental basis for the transfer of knowledge."
universität-rostock.md,"With its Research Data Policy, the University of Rostock aims to provide its researchers principles and recommendations for planning, handling, archiving and sustainably publishing research data. The University of Rostock recognises the value of exchanging and publishing data for disseminating research work and publications."
universität-rostock.md,"When acquiring and disseminating scientific findings and managing research data, all members of the university community at the University of Rostock and its associates observe the rules of good scientific practice1. They are required to provide the research data emanating from their research according to the rules or standards that have been established for the respective subject area."
universität-rostock.md,"Pursuant to the University of Rostock's Open Access Declaration2, the University recommends that the research data is made accessible to the public alongside the scientific publications."
universität-rostock.md,### Research Data
universität-rostock.md,"Research data is all data that is generated using scientific methods during a research project – this applies to newly created as well as previous data that has been adapted for use. Research Data Management (RDM) denotes all activities related to digital research data (not including their actual use), in particular their documentation, storage and long-term availability. These principles are applied to digital research data."
universität-rostock.md,"The provision of research data for further use is a service that not only benefits science, but also society as a whole. This additional effort as part of the research activities is recognised and encouraged."
universität-rostock.md,### Responsibilities
universität-rostock.md,"This policy is aimed at all members of the university community at the University of Rostock and its associates that handle research data, as well as researchers working in Rostock temporarily or as guests. They implement Research Data Management in line with the principles of this policy."
universität-rostock.md,"Research Data Management complies with the valid laws to protect individuals and intellectual property and the provisions of the statutes and the university regulations and is subject to specific research funding agreements concluded with third parties. These guidelines apply to research collaborations and research projects, as long as those involved have not stipulated any equivalent or stricter rules."
universität-rostock.md,## Handling Research Data
universität-rostock.md,"a. The research data is to be stored in accordance with the FAIR principles of findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability. Open access to research data is usually provided through the citable publication of data."
universität-rostock.md,"b. Research data that forms the essential foundation for published findings shall be archived in a trustworthy repository, corresponding to the usual customs of the subject area, for at least ten years after the date of publication."
universität-rostock.md,"c. Research data that cannot be made available as a result of legal and contractual regulations, or due to data protection and other protective reasons, or ethical and legal aspects, will be stored by a confidential storage service that complies with the FAIR principles. A corresponding service is provided by the University of Rostock."
universität-rostock.md,"d. Access to research data can be temporarily restricted by appropriate embargo periods for a maximum of three years after the end of the project, in order to enable the prior production of corresponding scientific evaluations, publications and theses or dissertations."
universität-rostock.md,"e. The research data shall be kept securely, processed and documented (details should include the entire research cycle as well as the tools and procedures used) pursuant to established regulations or standards, and stored for the long term."
universität-rostock.md,"f. Ideally, the corresponding descriptive meta data will be linked to the research data during the research process, or the meta data will be specified in the data management plan."

universität-stuttgart.md,# Research data management policy of the University of Stuttgart
universität-stuttgart.md,Issued by the Rectorate on 25 July 2017
universität-stuttgart.md,## Policy statement
universität-stuttgart.md,The ability to reproduce scientific findings and their applications requires that research data be managed responsibly. Capturing and accessing research data thus call for administering discipline-specific standards while also complying with applicable laws and regulations. The University of Stuttgart expects its researchers and cooperation partners to abide by and implement the following research data management protocols to enable the capture and publication of their research data.
universität-stuttgart.md,### Managing research data
universität-stuttgart.md,"Research data come about by being gathered, monitored, calculated, derived or generated during the research process. Even a proprietary piece of software qualifies as research data. Research data management spans the entire life cycle of these data: their generation, analysis, evaluation, publication and storage through to eventual reuse by third parties. Besides documenting the data, it includes specifying – and possibly storing – the equipment and software employed in producing them. Descriptive metadata should be linked to the research data even during the research process. Metadata allows drilling down to the stored research data; hence, it guarantees their reproducibility and reuse."
universität-stuttgart.md,### Protocols
universität-stuttgart.md,"1. The researchers who determine within the legal framework when and under which conditions the relevant research data are to be made accessible are responsible for the research data and for complying with discipline-specific standards. The University of Stuttgart promotes and expressly supports free access to research data, provided that ethical, legal, business, and contractual framework conditions are observed."
universität-stuttgart.md,"2. Research projects that generate data need careful data management planning and controls on access rights and restrictions, especially if the research data are to be made available to a community. Accordingly, research data management, guided by current professional standards and DFG recommendations on safeguarding good scientific practice, must be documented in a data management plan."
universität-stuttgart.md,"3. Research data must be stored securely and appropriately documented and reviewed. In the process, the scientific and legal rights of the researchers, the privacy of personal data, other obligations to third parties (e.g."
universität-stuttgart.md,"cooperation partners) and ethical, legal, and business constraints must be upheld. Digital research data are to be saved and stored in a suitable University of Stuttgart information infrastructure using services approved by the University."
universität-stuttgart.md,"With its central facilities, the University of Stuttgart supports researchers in planning, capturing, and retaining research data, in formulating and maintaining standards for handling research data, and with relevant training and consultation offerings created in cooperation with the specialized disciplines. The University of Stuttgart recommends and supports embedding a focus on the importance of discipline-specific, organized research date management in curriculum delivery by the respective faculties."
utrecht-university.md,# University policy framework for research data Utrecht University
utrecht-university.md,## 1. Structure of this policy framework
utrecht-university.md,"This policy framework begins with a definition of research data (section 2). Section 3 looks at the objectives and scope of the framework; specifically, what is this policy framework intended to accomplish and what does fall outside the framework?"
utrecht-university.md,Section 4 provides an overview of the current rules and regulations on which the framework is based and also describes the general criteria for effective research data management. Section 5 describes the diverse roles involved in research data management and distinguishes their respective responsibilities. Section 6 establishes the period of validity of the framework.
utrecht-university.md,## 2. Definitions
utrecht-university.md,Data are recorded facts or circumstances.
utrecht-university.md,Research data constitute
utrecht-university.md,"primary research data: the raw, rough measurements or observations Secondary research data: the results after the data have been processed by a researcher (recoded, combined, categorised, visualised, etc.)"
utrecht-university.md,"External research data: research data made available to Utrecht University and having received, for this use, licensed access to use as a source -  but the rights are kept fully outside Utrecht University (such as statistical, financial or survey data)."
utrecht-university.md,"Archivable research data constitute all research data, excluding external research data, deemed relevant to preserve after the research is completed, for example in connection with the verifiability of the research and/or for possible reuse."
utrecht-university.md,This policy framework applies to all research data.
utrecht-university.md,Research data are intrinsically linked to
utrecht-university.md,"research objects (e.g. geological material, blood samples, archival documents)"
utrecht-university.md,documentation of the research process (e.g. in lab (note-) books)
utrecht-university.md,"research results; all inventions, outcomes, materials, methods, processes, products (e.g. publications), programmes, software, findings and/or discoveries generated within the context of a research project"
utrecht-university.md,## 3. Aims and scope
utrecht-university.md,### Aim of this policy framework
utrecht-university.md,"Researchers at Utrecht University are supposed to be cognisant of the requirements that the university applies to working with research data. This policy is intended to set parameters to safeguard the quality, availability and accessibility of research data within Utrecht University and also to provide a basis for evaluating compliance with laws, regulations and codes of conduct."

wrexham-university.md,## Introduction
wrexham-university.md,"Wrexham University is committed to maintaining the highest standards of ethics, rigour, and integrity in all its research. It seeks to protect the dignity, rights, and welfare of all those involved in the research it produces. The University recognises its duty to safeguard the confidentiality of personal research data in keeping with its responsibilities under the Data Protection Act 2018 and the General Data Protection Regulation 2018 (UK GDPR). This legislation defines the University's responsibility to ensure appropriate organisational and technical measures are in place to protect personal data."
wrexham-university.md,Any research project collecting data from a human participant or collecting or processing personal data must have formal ethical approval from the University and comply with the University's Data Protection and Data Disposal Policy.
wrexham-university.md,"The University recognises research data as a valued asset. It identifies the maintenance of accurate and retrievable data from the research community as best practice, acknowledging that sharing research data is crucial to the impact, visibility, transparency, trust, and knowledge transfer of the University's research."
wrexham-university.md,"Wrexham University supports the UKRI Common Principles on Research Data, acknowledging that publicly funded research data are a public good, produced in the public interest for societal benefit and, where possible, be made openly available with a few restrictions as possible in a timely and responsible manner."
wrexham-university.md,## Purpose
wrexham-university.md,"This Policy sets out the principles that should be followed by staff and students at Wrexham University when processing research data throughout the research lifecycle. The Policy promotes good practice in research data management, fostering responsibility for preparing Research Data Plans and ensuring research data is stored, retained, accessed, and disposed of securely, complying with legal and ethical obligations, University policy and, where applicable, the requirements of funding bodies."
wrexham-university.md,"The Policy defines the individual and institutional responsibilities that the individual and institutional levels that should guide the work of those involved in research data collection, curation, storage, and maintenance. It sets out the basis on which University staff and students will process any personal data collected from data subjects in the course of conducting research or that is provided to those conducting research by data subjects or other sources for the same."
wrexham-university.md,## Scope
wrexham-university.md,"This Policy applies to all staff and students at Wrexham University engaged in research, whether or not the research is funded and whether or not the data collected includes collecting or processing personal data. The Policy covers all data collected during a research study and all members of the University involved in the creation, collection, and curation of research data under the auspices of the University, including sessional, visiting or emeritus, associates, honorary, contractors, consultants, or volunteers."
wrexham-university.md,# Prifysgol Wrecsam Wrexham University
wrexham-university.md,## Definitions
wrexham-university.md,"For the purpose of this Policy, research data are defined as that which is collected, observed, or created for the purpose of analysing and producing original research results. Such research data are the recorded information, regardless of the form or the media in which they may exist, necessary to support or validate a research project's observations, findings or outputs. In practice, the nature of research data can vary widely depending on the discipline. It can be textual, numerical, qualitative, quantitative, final, preliminary, physical, digital or print. Research data comes in many formats, including word-processed documents, PDFs, spreadsheets, scanned lab books, online surveys, digital recordings, databases or computer software."
wrexham-university.md,## Principles
wrexham-university.md,### Collection
wrexham-university.md,"Research data must be collected responsibly, using the correct methods and techniques to protect the integrity of your data.  Research data must be collected in accordance with the ethical approval of a research project and the legal obligations of the Data Protection Act 2018."
wrexham-university.md,### Ownership
wrexham-university.md,"For research carried out under a grant or contract or involving collaboration with another institution or external party, the agreement's terms will determine the data's ownership and rights. It is recommended that any contract with an external party identify the process for Research Data Management in conjunction with the principles of this Policy."
wrexham-university.md,"Where no external contract and no intellectual property rights exist, the University owns the data generated during research undertaken under the auspices of the University by staff members in its employment and postgraduate research students. Where taught students generate data under the supervision of a staff member as part of a funded project the data will be owned by the University or in accordance with the terms of the contract."
wrexham-university.md,### Organisation and Technical Measures
wrexham-university.md,The University Research Ethics Policy sets out the ethical review and approval process to ensure that the University research is carried out in the public interest and is lawful under the UK GDPR and Data Protection Act. All staff and students conducting research within the scope of the Research Ethics Policy must seek ethical approval before data collection and processing commence.
wrexham-university.md,Data Management Plans and Data Protection Impact Assessments
wrexham-university.md,"Data Management Plans (DMP) should be completed before the commencement of all research projects. The DMP should address the type, volume, storage, confidentiality, retention, sharing, deposit, reuse, and integrity of the data throughout the project lifecycle. The Principal Investigator or Supervisor is responsible for creating and owning"
wrexham-university.md,# Prifysgol Wrecsam Wrexham University
wrexham-university.md,a research data management plan and ensuring the full research team and collaborators are aware of and adhere to it.
wrexham-university.md,"Many funders require researchers to submit a data management plan as part of the application process. Researchers should respect the data management policies of the funder(s) and other external parties. Many public funders of research, including all the UK Research Councils, accept that the management of research data is a legitimate research expense."
wrexham-university.md,"Research projects requiring ethical approval should use the data management plan provided in the online ethical approval application form. Projects not requiring ethical approval should complete the Wrexham University Data Management Plan Template. When preparing an application, researchers applying for funding should consider the terms and requirements listed in the funder policy documents. Researchers can access DMPOnline to view the data management plan templates based on the requirements listed in the funder policy documents."
wrexham-university.md,The UK GDPR creates a legal obligation to think about and mitigate data protection issues and privacy concerns at the project planning stage before any data is gathered. A Date Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) is an assessment to help researchers identify any potential risks a project might have as regards intruding into participants' privacy. The DPIA then assists with implementing appropriate measures and controls to minimise and manage those risks. The legislation has made DPIAs mandatory for higher-risk data processing to ensure that privacy and data protection are key considerations from the start of any project and then taken into account throughout the project's lifecycle.
wrexham-university.md,"The European Commission (DG Research and Innovation) recommends that a DPIA be carried out for data processing operations that may entail higher ethical risks, such as:"
wrexham-university.md,"<html><body><table><tr><td>TypesofPersonal Data</td><td>Racial or ethnic origin Political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs Genetic, biometric or health data Sex Life or sexual orientation Trade Union membership</td></tr><tr><td>Data Subjects</td><td>Children Vulnerable people People who have not given their explicit consent to participate in the project</td></tr><tr><td>Scale or complexity of data Processing</td><td>Large scale processing of personal data Systematic monitoring of a publicly accessible area on alarge scale Involvementofmultipledatasetsand/orservice providers orthecombination and analysisofdifferent datasets (big data)</td></tr><tr><td>Data-collection or processing Techniques</td><td>Privacy-invasive methods ortechnologies (the covert observation, surveillance, tracking or deception of individuals) Using camera systems to monitor behaviour or record sensitive information.</td></tr></table></body></html>"

wrexham-university.md,"A DPIA screening is included in the Research Ethics Committee approval process. However, some funders will require a separate DPIA, which should be completed using the University Data Protection Impact Assessment Template or one provided by the funder if that is specified. In cases where a research project does not require ethical review, researchers must still complete a DPIA screening and, if necessary, a full assessment, which must be authorised by the Data Protection Officer."
wrexham-university.md,The University mandates that a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) is completed prior to the commencement of a research project that is likely to result in high risk to individuals. The DPIA process is a legal requirement and an important tool to help you identify and minimise the data protection risks of a project involving personal data processing. Researchers should refer to the ICO for further information on the definition of high-risk data processing and the Wrexham University Data Protection Impact Assessment template and guidance document.
wrexham-university.md,## Storage
wrexham-university.md,"All research data must be stored in a university-managed environment throughout the project's lifecycle. A university approved environment protects research data against a data breach, data loss and corruption, and unauthorised access and guarantees the security and integrity of research data and participant information. The University recommends that research data collected by staff or students be stored on the University's private drive (Z drive), shared drive (Y drive), or cloud-based University (Teams and OneDrive). Physical research data should be stored on the University premises in a secure environment at all times. Researcher working remotely should refer to the principles and guidance outlined in the University Remote and Mobile Working Policy"
wrexham-university.md,## Data Sharing
wrexham-university.md,"Where proposed research projects involve collaboration with third parties (e.g another university, NHS Trust or other external partners) and the sharing of personal data, special category data, criminal convictions or offences data or pseudonymised data is anticipated, an appropriate contract or data sharing agreement must be put in place before any data is exchanged."
wrexham-university.md,# Prifysgol Wrecsam Wrexham University
wrexham-university.md,"Data Sharing Agreements set out the framework for the sharing of personal data and documents, the purpose of the sharing, covers what happens to the data at each stage and puts in place standards that help all the parties involved in the sharing to be clear about their roles and responsibilities."
wrexham-university.md,A ‘Data Sharing Agreement' is required where the University and the other party are both Data Controllers or Joint Controllers and intend on sharing personal information routinely and regularly between themselves.
wrexham-university.md,A 'Data Processing Agreement' is required when the University is the data controller and contracts an outside company to undertake a task that involves the processing of personal data on its behalf.
wrexham-university.md,Transferring Data Outside the EU
wrexham-university.md,"The UK GDPR does not allow the transfer of personal data outside the EU or a country without adequate protection without meeting a condition like explicit consent or a binding contract. Researchers must always, therefore, obtain explicit consent or anonymise data before sending data outside the European Economic Area (the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein). Some countries listed by the EU have received adequacy decisions (as of January 2021, these are Andorra, Argentina, Canada, Faroe Islands, Guernsey, Israel, Isle of Man, Japan, Jersey, New Zealand, Republic of Korea, Switzerland, United Kingdom, Uruguay but the list may change with time)."
wrexham-university.md,"The UK is currently considered adequate for data protection purposes until 2025. In all cases, researchers should use password protection or encryption where possible in transit, but bear in mind that some countries will require the use of encryption keys if personal data are transferred to them."
wrexham-university.md,## Retention
wrexham-university.md,"Funded research projects must comply with any retention periods specified by the funder requirements. Where a funder does not specify a retention period or a project is unfunded, research data generated by a member staff should be held for a minimum of 10 years from the point of collecting, creating, or generating the research data, where appropriate to do so. The University requires that data directly underpinning any published findings is stored for a minimum of this time frame to support or validate a research project's observations, findings, or outputs."
wrexham-university.md,Research data collected by Wrexham University students should be retained up to the point of the assessment period. Research data collected by students at the University to support a potential publication in the future should be retained for 10 years. It is the supervisor's responsibility to ensure any personal research data collected by students has been deleted and that any retained data is stored appropriately.

wrexham-university.md,"Individual Research Councils' and other funders' data policies and good research practice guidance provide additional requirements and should be consulted, as well as retention periods specified in each Research Data Management Plan. In many instances, researchers will resolve to retain research data and records for a longer period than the minimum requirement. Researchers should note that personal data can be kept in non-anonymised form for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed."
wrexham-university.md,## Disposal
wrexham-university.md,"The disposal and destruction of research data must be undertaken in accordance with the University's Data Protection and Data Disposal Policy.

wrexham-university.md,## Access
wrexham-university.md,Wrexham University recognises the benefits of making Research Data accessible to the public and broader academic community.
wrexham-university.md,Access to research data during the course of a research project should be restricted to the collaborators of the research project or provided access when the correct data-sharing approvals are in place.
wrexham-university.md,"Access to research data after a research project has finished should be considered in relation to the ownership, ethical, confidential, sensitive, commercial, legal, regulatory or funding restrictions. Research Data produced by Wrexham University staff should be openly available with as few restrictions as possible where appropriate. Personal research data may be made available if it is in an anonymised form and where there is informed consent for it to be shared."
wrexham-university.md,"The University recommends that data sets are assigned a persistent identifier, such as a Digital Object Identifier (DOI). The use of ORCID (Open Researcher and Contributor ID), as well as the use of standard open licences for sharing research data is also recommended. Authors of restricted data sets should also consider their deposit in a trusted repository to aid discovery, meet funder requirements and ensure the data remains available to fulfil legitimate access requests."
wrexham-university.md,## FAIR Data
wrexham-university.md,"Where it is lawful to do so, the University supports the broad global consensus that publicly funded research data should be made openly available as soon as possible with as few restrictions as necessary. Additionally, many UK and international funders have embraced FAIR principles for data sharing, making data."
