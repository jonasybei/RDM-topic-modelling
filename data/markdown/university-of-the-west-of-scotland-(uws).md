# Research Data Management Procedure v1 – April 2023  

# RESEARCH DATA MANAGEMENT PROCEDURE  

# Introduction  

This document aims to enable and support best practice in research data management at UWS, reflecting the University’s commitment to the UK Concordat on Open Research Data. The University recognises the importance of meeting funders’ requirement with regard to open research data and wishes to contribute to a research environment where data is shared as widely as possible, so that other researchers may both consult data to validate the published findings and re-use the data for new research purposes.

# Scope  

This document applies to all research data generated or adapted by Researchers at UWS, including postgraduate (PG) research students and visiting researchers. The University requires its Researchers to manage research data responsibly, and to preserve and disseminate data of long-term value in line with this Procedure.  

# Definitions  

Archive data: data that is selected for retention upon completion of the project, that has been curated into a usable and accessible format.  

Data Management Plans (DMPs) are living documents that describe how data will be managed during the life of the project. As living documents, they can and should be updated throughout the course of the project. DMPs are often requested by funders at the bid stage and should state what data will be created and how, outline plans for sharing and preservation and note any restrictions on access.  

Data repository: storage space for Researchers to deposit datasets associated with their research.  

DOI: Digital Object Identifier.  

Dynamic data: data that is collected during an active research project. This is likely to change throughout the project.  

Metadata: literally “data about other data”. In the context of this document, it refers to descriptive or contextual information that helps the identification, location, retrieval of and access to data and research outputs.  

Principal Investigator (PI): the individual leading a programme of research.  

Research Data: includes a range of sources that have been used to carry out the research. They may include, for example, statistics, collections of digital images, sound/video recordings, sketchbooks, transcripts of interviews, survey data etc. The primary purpose of research data is to provide the information necessary to support or validate a research project's observations, findings or outputs. Please refer to the Concordat on Open Research Data https://www.ukri.org/wpcontent/uploads/2020/10/UKRI-020920-ConcordatonOpenResearchData.pdf - for a comprehensive definition.  

Research Data Management (RDM): encompasses the sum of activities undertaken by researchers and research organisations in relation to the collection, processing, retention and disposal of research data.  

Researcher: anyone undertaking research or involved in collecting, generating or creating research data for or on behalf of the University, which shall include, but not be limited to, employees, postgraduate (PG) research students and visiting researchers.  

University Repository: storage space where researchers upload details of their research outputs and activities. At UWS, PURE is used as the institutional research repository.  

# Benefits of Research Data Management and Open Data  

Following good research data management procedures provides several benefits to researchers:  

• Enhancing the visibility and impact of the individual’s and the University’s research  

Quicker results, as data is shared and reused  

Facilitating interdisciplinary research  

Increasing transparency and ensuring validation of results  

Ensuring compliance with funders’ requirements.  

# Data management responsibilities  

Researchers have a responsibility to take care of the data they collect while working and studying at the University, and to manage them in accordance with any relevant funders' policies. In particular, Researchers are required, wherever possible, to preserve and share data that supports published research findings by depositing them in a suitable data repository. The Principal Investigator (or the lead Researcher at UWS, in case of collaborative projects where the PI is based elsewhere) or research student, is responsible for the research data management and compliance to funders’ or regulatory agencies’ legislative or contractual obligations throughout the course of the project.  

Researchers are responsible for ensuring that, when leaving the institution, a copy of the data produced under the auspices of the University is retained and appropriate appraisal decisions in relation to the retention, transference of ownership, or destruction of research data held in the University’s storage environments are made.  

The line manager or Lead Supervisor is responsible to ensure that a new data owner is appointed, who can make curatorial decisions about the data (such as those relating to the deletion or migration of data). Ultimate responsibility lies with the Head of School.  

The University’s role is to provide training, support and, where possible, mechanisms for deposit and funder-compliant storage of data.  

# Planning Data Collection and Data Management Plans  

Every new research proposal should address any requirements related to the collection and use of data. This can be achieved by creating a data management plan (DMP). Where specifically required by funding bodies, the DMP should adhere to the funders’ requirements. Research data management roles and responsibilities should be clearly defined and documented within a research project. Where there are no specific funders’ requirements, the UWS data management template should be used. The template can be downloaded at  

ntmailuwsac.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/connect/document ed8RBrTdpzX_S-eMBkx5hd2P8XpbowvOUVpJHPA?e=uArCw5&CID=57F3DEEE5BA7-4875-8F30-35F1EB96AA54. More information on the requirements of funders and preparation of data management plans is provided by the Digital Curation Centre - https://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/data-management-plans  

The PI or PG research student is responsible for ensuring that a DMP is completed for every project, kept up-to-date throughout the project, and complied with by all members of the project.  

# Data sharing  

The University’s position is that data should be as open as it can be, to encourage reuse, and should be managed in accordance to the Principles set out in the UKRI Common Principles on Data Policy - https://www.ukri.org/funding/information-for-awardholders/data-policy/common-principles-on-data-policy/ -, that 'publicly funded research data are a public good, produced in the public interest, which should be made openly available with as few restrictions as possible in a timely and responsible manner'.  

There might be circumstances where restrictions need to be applied (e.g., third party content, sensitive data, confidentiality). Any access restrictions should be clearly stated and explained in the DMP.  

Data must be accessible and well signposted. It is an expectation that the records containing metadata of research outputs on the University Repository will include links to the relevant datasets, wherever stored.  

When a dataset has been deposited in a data repository or otherwise stored for preservation, the Researcher should register the details of the dataset with the University by contacting pure@uws.ac.uk, with the persistent identifier or DOI,  even if access to the data is restricted, so that a record of the data can be maintained and made available for discovery.  

# Data storage  

During the life of the project, Researchers must ensure that dynamic data is stored securely, is organised effectively and is protected from loss. Researchers should use University-approved storage and follow the University’s procedures, in order to guarantee the security and integrity of research data and protect against loss or corruption.  

Technical support requirements for the collection, storage and processing of research data should be considered at the planning stage. Information about data storage and other support for the management of research data provided by IT can be found at https://www.uws.ac.uk/media/6376/data-classification-schedule-2022.pdf  

On completion of the project, data selected for archiving should be stored in a suitable data repository, that meets the stated criteria. The data repository chosen for depositing the archive data should allow deposit into additional repositories. Any external data repository selected must not charge any fee for access to the stored data. Where use of a specific data repository is mandated by the funder, Researchers must comply.  

A metadata record for all archive research data hosted internally and externally must be added to the University Repository. Researchers are advised to review the FAIR Principles - https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/ - for guidance on the construction of appropriate metadata.  

Research data selected for archiving should normally be preserved and accessible for a period of 10 years, but a longer period should be considered for projects of major clinical, social or environmental importance. Where a storage period is mandated by the funder, this should be adhered to as an absolute minimum.  

# Data rights  

Unless mandated by the funder, exclusive rights to reuse and publish data must not be passed to commercial entities without retaining the rights to make the data openly available for reuse.  

Datasets should be assigned appropriate licences to state ownership and clarify data reuse. Creative Commons licences are strongly recommended.  

The University reserves the right to keep a copy of the research data related to all research conducted under its auspices, even when Researchers responsible for the data leave the institution.  

For research projects involving the collection and handling of personal data, a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) should be conducted.
