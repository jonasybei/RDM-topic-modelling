# DATA MANAGEMENT POLICY  

## Purpose  

1. This document explains the University of Suffolk’s policy on data protection and data management and is based on the following principles:  

The University will comply with all relevant legislation, particularly the Data Protection Act 2018 and the EU General Data Protection Regulations 2016 (“GDPR”). Ensuring compliance is a corporate responsibility of the University requiring the active involvement of, and appreciation by, all Employees and Other Workers1 at all levels of the organisation, including honorary staff/associates, contractors, hourly paid lecturers and any students or interns carrying out work on behalf of the University. The University will provide support and services to enable staff handling personal data to remain compliant with the legislation and the University’s requirements in respect of data security.  

## About the Policy  

2. At the University, personal data from a wide range of individuals is collected, analysed, stored, shared, transferred, processed and at the end of the retention period, destroyed. Personal data used in this way, is from staff, students, applicants, alumni, visitors and people taking part in our research. Maintaining the security and privacy of this personal data is essential. This policy sets out the University’s requirements as Data Controller when processing this Personal Data.  

3. This Policy is approved by the University’s Quality Committee and is subject to review every four years in line with the University’s review schedule of policies and procedures. Review will take place earlier where changes in legislation require such review.  

4. A University of Suffolk Data User is defined as staff, students and others who have access to and use Personal Data on behalf of the University. All University of Suffolk Data Users must:  

comply with this Policy when processing Personal Data on behalf of the University recognise that they have a role to play in ensuring that the University maintains the trust and confidence of the individuals about whom the University processes personal data (including its own staff) comply with legal obligations and protect the University’s reputation.  

5. This also applies to Partnership staff or others working with or on behalf of the University of Suffolk, accessing University of Suffolk systems, with responsibilities and expectations set out in the relevant Partnerships Agreement.  

6. Disciplinary action can be taken against those who do not comply, particularly in cases when there has been deliberate, wilful, or negligent disregard of the Policy and University requirements.  

7. The University has processes in place, including this Policy, which are designed to protect the accuracy, integrity, and confidentiality of personal data and to ensure that individuals are able to exercise their rights. Appendix 1 provides more information about these other policies.  

8. Key words are defined in the Glossary of Terms in Appendix 2.  

9. If you do not feel confident in your knowledge or understanding of this Policy, or you have concerns regarding the implementation of this Policy, you should seek advice from the Data Governance Team (contact details below).  

### Training  

10. All staff must complete the University’s online Data Protection training, which is available via the University of Suffolk Online Training portal. Most staff are required to complete the module every three years. Some staff are required to complete it annually because of the nature of their work (e.g. if they work with NHS patient data). New members of staff must complete this module as part of their induction. It is the responsibility of managers to ensure that their staff complete the required training, including any additional training required (for example, for researchers), both as part of their induction and biennially thereafter, recording completion in the individual’s My Review record.  

11. Whilst some staff will have received elements of data protection training as part of their research requirements, researchers employed by the University must also complete the University’s online Data Protection Training (University of Suffolk Online Training) regardless of any previous training.  

12. The Data Governance Team regularly reviews completion records and routinely contacts those who have not completed their training. If no action is taken from this contact the Data Governance team contacts the line manager of the individual  

13. It is the responsibility of the Pro Vice-Chancellor of Research and for each supervisor of Postgraduate Research Students to ensure the University’s online Data Protection Training is undertaken by PGR students (or any additional data protection training modules identified as appropriate), at the outset of their programme or annually, and for ensuring completion. More generally the module can be made available to those students undertaking research which involves the use of personal data, as required.  

## Data Protection Principles  

14. The GDPR sets out principles that the University must observe and comply with when processing Personal Data. The GDPR requires that personal data shall:  

a. be processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner   
b. be collected only for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes   
c. be adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which it is to be processed   
d. be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date   
e. not be kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the data is processed   
f. be processed in a manner than ensures its security using appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accident loss, destruction or damage   
g. not be transferred to a country outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) without appropriate safeguards being in place  

Further information on the Data Protection Principles can be found on the Information Commissioner’s website (ICO - Data Protection Principles).  

15. The University and its staff who process or use personal data must be able to demonstrate compliance with all the above principles.  

## Accountability and Governance  

16. The University is responsible for, and must be able to demonstrate, compliance with the GDPR and data protection.  

17. There are several actions the University, and its Data Users, can and, in some cases, must take to meet this data protection principle, including:  

Implementation of Data Management Policy   
Taking a ‘data protection by design and default’ approach   
Ensuring that written contracts are in place with organisations that process personal data   
on the University’s behalf   
Maintaining documentation of all University processing activities   
Implementing appropriate security measures   
Recording and reporting personal data breaches to the data governance team   
Carrying out data protection impact assessments (DPIAs) where the use of personal data   
is likely to result in a high risk to individuals’ interests   
Appointment of a Data Protection Officer   
Adherence to relevant codes of conduct and signing up to certification schemes  

### Registering with the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) as a Data Controller  

18. As an organisation that processes personal and special category data, the University is required to register with the ICO. Since 2006 the University has featured on the ICO’s Register of data protection fee payers with registration number Z9376827 as a public authority data controller.  

### Data Protection Officer  

19. The University’s Data Protection Officer, supported by the Data Governance Team, advises the University on data protection law, monitors compliance, provides advice to Data Users, and ensures that guidance, training, and resources are available to Data Users.  The Data Protection Officer is the point of contact for individuals wishing to exercise their rights in relation to their data, and for any contact with the ICO.  Contact details for the Data Protection Officer and their team who deal with general queries and Subject Access Requests are as follows:  

Data Protection Officer datagovernance@uos.ac.uk 01473 338240  

### Legal basis for processing  

20. Whenever the University processes personal data there must be a valid lawful basis for that processing. There are six lawful bases for general processing of Personal Data and ten lawful bases for processing Special Category Data. If Special Category Data is being processed, both a lawful basis for general processing and an additional condition for processing this type of data must be identified. These are listed in full in Appendix 3.  

21. Further sources of advice and guidance are set out in Appendix 4.  

22. In practice, for many of the University’s activities it will rely on the legal basis that the ‘processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest’ as this covers our work as a university in teaching and research. However sometimes the University will need to rely on alternative bases, and these will be documented in the Data Privacy Impact Assessment carried out in respect of the specific activity.  

### Profiling and Automated Decision Making  

23. The ICO has produced guidance (Automated decision-making and profiling) on Profiling and Automated Decision Making which is available on its website and should be taken into account before considering any activity or task which involves Profiling or Automated Decision Making.  

24. Before starting a task or activity which involves Profiling or Automated Decision Making, the following steps must be carried out:  

a. A Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) must be carried out. The Data Governance Team must be informed and consulted as part of that exercise   
b. A Privacy Notice must inform individuals if their data will be used for solely automated decision-making processes with legal or similarly significant effects. This must explicitly set out the Data Subject’s rights. The Privacy Notice should be approved and held by the Data Governance Team.   
c. The DPIA must be kept under regular review, and records of those reviews must be retained.  

### Data Protection by Design and Data Privacy Impact Assessments (DPIAs)  

25. An aspect of the accountability and governance data protection principle, the University must ensure that consideration is given to the protection of data from design through the life cycle of the process or system.  

26. It is therefore the responsibility of any University member introducing or designing a new process or system, to take account of the data protection principles and ensure that data protection laws are complied with and can be demonstrated. Information pertaining to the University DPIA process can be found by staff on The Hub.  

27. A DPIA enables Data Users to identify and minimise the data protection risks of a project. A DPIA must be completed for any data processing that is likely to result in a high risk to individuals. It is also good practice to complete a DPIA for major projects which will require the processing of personal data.  

28. A DPIA should:  

Provide a description of the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing   
Assess necessity, proportionality and compliance measures   
Identify and assess risks to individuals   
Identify additional measures required to mitigate the risks  

29. Further information about DPIAs is available on the ICO website (ICO - Data Protection Impact Assessments).  

30. DPIAs should be shared with the Data Protection Officer (datagovernance@uos.ac.uk) prior to sign-off and commencement of the project.  

### Data Retention  

31. Data at the University of Suffolk are retained and disposed of according to need. The overarching principle is that data should only be retained and stored for as long as such data have a legitimate purpose, and thereafter they should be disposed of securely. Each School and Professional Service area of the Institution holds a Data Retention Schedule which specifies the nature of the data retained, the retention period, the reason for retention, and the action to be taken at the end of the retention period, including how the data are to be disposed of.  

32. At the end of the retention period, data should be disposed of and/or destroyed. Manual confidential waste must be placed in the lockable confidential waste bins located across campus (please see list of locations under Estates and Sustainability on Hub) and not in general paper recycling bins.

## Appendix 3: Legal bases for processing  

1. Processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that at least one of the following applies:  

a. The Data Subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes.   
b. Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the Data Subject prior to entering into a contract.   
c. Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Data Controller is subject.   
d. Processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the Data Subject or of another natural person.   
e. Processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the Data Controller.   
f. Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Data Controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the Data Subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the Data Subject is a child. (This does not apply to processing carried out by public authorities, such as Universities, in the performance of their public tasks).  

2. There are 10 legal bases on which Special Category Personal Data may be processed:  

a. The Data Subject has given explicit consent to the processing of those personal data for one or more specified purposes.   
b. Processing is necessary for the purposes of carrying out the obligations and rights of the Data Controller or of the Data Subject in the field of employment and social security (subject to the Data Protection Act 2018).   
c. Processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the Data Subject or of another natural person where the data subject is physically or legally incapable of giving consent.   
d. Processing is carried out in the course of its legitimate activities with appropriate safeguards by a foundation, association or any other not-for-profit body with a political, philosophical, religious or trade union aim and on condition that the processing relates solely to the members or to former members of the body or to persons who have regular contact with it in connection with its purposes and that the personal data are not disclosed outside that body without the consent of the Data Subjects; 12 Revised Data Protection Policy 27.06.2018.   
e. Processing relates to personal data which are manifestly made public by the Data Subject.   
f. Processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims or whenever courts are acting in their judicial capacity.   
g. Processing is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest, on the basis of Union or Member State law which shall be proportionate to the aim pursued, respect the essence of the right to data protection and provide for suitable and specific measures to safeguard the fundamental rights and the interests of the Data Subject.   
h. Processing is necessary for the purposes of preventive or occupational medicine, for the assessment of the working capacity of the employee, medical diagnosis, the provision of health or social care or treatment or the management of health or social care systems and services on the basis of Union or Member State law or pursuant to contract with a health professional and subject to safeguards.   
i. Processing is necessary for reasons of public interest in the area of public health, such as protecting against serious cross-border threats to health or ensuring high standards of quality and safety of health care and of medicinal products or medical devices, on the basis of Union or Member State law which provides for suitable and specific measures to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the Data Subject, in particular professional secrecy; L 119/38 EN Official Journal of the European Union 4.5.2016. Processing is necessary for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes, respect the essence of the right to data protection and provide for suitable and specific measures to safeguard the fundamental rights and the interests of the Data Subject.
