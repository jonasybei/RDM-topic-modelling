# RESEARCH DATA MANAGEMENT POLICY  

# 1. Introduction  

# 1.1 Statement of intent  

1.1.1 The University of Huddersfield’s academic community produces large volumes of research data, and wishes to ensure the widest possible access to its world-class research. The value and utility of research outputs increases the more broadly they are available to be considered and used by others, including scholars, businesses and charities around the globe, as well as society in general. Open Data and shared research data will also help to highlight the excellence of its research. It will attract scholars and students, foster collaboration, and enhance public engagement with research, as well as maximise the intellectual, social, cultural and economic impact of research.  

1.1.2 The University of Huddersfield supports the Concordat on Open Research Data and the UKRI general policies and guidance on research data which encourage members of the UK research community to make openly available research data they have gathered and generated.  The University is committed to reviewing new initiatives in this area as they arise and supporting them as deemed appropriate.  

1.1.3 The University of Huddersfield also recognises that good practice in data management is key to an efficient and effective research process. It is essential for enabling and safeguarding the longevity and continuing intelligibility of data, and for ensuring that sensitive data is handled in compliance with all relevant ethical and legal requirements. Preserving the data that underpins research outputs, whether it is shared or not, is integral to research integrity and reproducibility of results.  

# 1.2 Purpose  

1.2.1 There is an increased requirement on researchers to effectively preserve their research data with the intention of sharing it publicly, while at the same time respecting concerns in relation to privacy, safety, security and commercial interests; this is under the assumption that the outputs of University research are a public good, produced in the public interest and for societal benefit. This policy aims to establish the measures needed to facilitate the appropriate curation and management of data, to secure its longevity and its potential to be shared.  

1.2.2 This policy is intended to help promote good practice around research data, with the particular aim that it is:  

• stored securely and preserved in order to ensure its continuing utility;   
• appropriately identifiable, retrievable, and available when needed;   
• an accurate, complete, reliable and coherent representation of the materials collected; kept in a manner that is compliant with legal obligations, including the Data Protection Act 2018 / The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 2018 and the Freedom of Information Act 2000, and, where applicable, the requirements of funding bodies; able to be made available to others in line with appropriate ethical, data sharing and open access principles, especially when the data underpins published research.  

# 1.3 Definition of Research Data  

Research data: the recorded information (regardless of the form or the media in which it may exist) necessary to support or validate a research project’s observations, findings or outputs, or which is required for legal or regulatory compliance.  

# 2. Responsibilities of the University  

2.1 The University will provide:  

support, advice and information to researchers on all aspects of research data management   
suitable infrastructure to facilitate the appropriate management, archiving and sharing of research data.   
training and guidance to promote best practice in research data management.  

2.2 In order to support and enable this policy, the University is committed to engaging with researchers to fulfil the mutual responsibilities. The university will endeavour to provide research data management services and infrastructure capabilities which are adequate and fit for the purpose of supporting researchers’ compliance with the policy, particularly for academic staff and PGRs with externally funded research projects.  

2.3 The University has set an archiving period of no less than 10 years for all externally funded research data.  

# 3. Responsibilities of the researcher  

3.1 Principal Investigators (unless a defined role of data manager is assigned within the project group) are required to prepare a data management plan (DMP) which describes the data management life cycle for the data to be collected and processed by a research project. DMPs are usually required as part of research proposals for external funding and the University encourages similar best practice for internally funded projects. DMPs should include information on:  

the handling of research data during and after the end of the project   
• what data will be collected, processed and/or generated   
• which methodology and standards will be applied   
· whether data will be shared/made open access and   
• how data will be curated and preserved (including after the end of the project)  

3.2 Principal Investigators (unless a defined role of data manager is assigned within the project group) hold day-to-day responsibility for the effective management of research data generated within or obtained from their research, including by their research groups. This shall include understanding and complying with the requirements of any relevant contract with or grant to the University that includes provisions regarding the ownership, preservation and dissemination of research data.  

3.3 Researchers will protect confidential, personal and sensitive personal research data in accordance with legal and ethical requirements related to the research they conduct.  

3.4 Researchers will make every reasonable effort to keep an accurate and comprehensive record of their research, including documenting clear procedures for the collection, storage, use, reuse, access and retention or deletion of the research data associated with their records. Where appropriate, this should include defining and documenting protocols and responsibilities in collaborative research projects.  

3.4 Researchers will make every reasonable effort to recognise Intellectual Property arising from their research activities and manage that Intellectual Property according to any funder requirements or contractual obligations.  

3.5 Researchers will preserve and provide appropriate access to their research data supporting outputs after the end of their project for as long as it has continuing value, in accordance with legal and funder requirements and paying due regard to discipline norms and cost. Notwithstanding, the minimum retention period for research data and records is ten years after publication or public release of the work of the research. School Research Ethics Committees can consider and approve proposals from PIs to retain data for shorter periods of time where reasoned arguments are provided e.g. where individuals participating in the research may be put at significant risk of identification.  

3.6 Researchers should deposit their data in an appropriate data repository along with sufficient descriptive metadata (a data record) to ensure that it can be found and understood. Where academic staff deposit data somewhere other than the University’s institutional data repository (the University of Huddersfield Research Portal), a metadata record should still be created in the portal which describes and points to the data.  

3.7 Published papers which rely on data generated by the authors should include a data access statement even where there are no data associated with the article or the data are inaccessible, In line with UKRI policy on Open access. Authors should also apply good data citation principles and formally cite data which has directly informed the conclusions drawn in their papers.  

3.8 Researchers are responsible for agreeing arrangements (with their Research Centre Director or nominee) as to where their research data will be stored and who will have access to this after they leave (or retire from) the University.  The researcher’s department or School reserves the right to retain a copy of the data for an appropriate period to ensure compliance with any legal or regulatory responsibilities, and/or research grant or contractual requirements.  

3.9 Researchers can obtain advice and support from the Research Data Management Team (rdm@hud.ac.uk) team.
