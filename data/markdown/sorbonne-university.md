# RESEARCH COMMISSION OF 24 JUNE 2021  

Open research data policy within the Sorbonne University Alliance  

Since its creation, the Sorbonne University Alliance has chosen to be fully involved in the open science movement, allowing access to knowledge for all. With this in mind, it is committed to opening up the results of the research produced within its institutions and promoting their dissemination, in order to share with citizens the fruits of their contribution to public research and to develop a trustworthy science.  

Taking up for itself the terms of the Sorbonne declaration on research data rights of 27 January 20201, the Sorbonne University Alliance recalls that :  

access to and sharing of data enables the development of new knowledge and accelerates discoveries for the benefit of society, while promoting economic development and employment;   
it must be possible to share and re-use research data freely.  

The management of research data, including backup, storage and diffusion, must therefore be carried out in accordance with international standards and practices and meet strict requirements, while ensuring compliance with legal obligations within an ethical framework.  

For these reasons, the Sorbonne University Alliance and its members are committed to :  

encouraging their research teams and staff to open up research data as much as possible;   
promoting the development of data management plans at the design stage of research protocols;   
enhancing the commitment of research staff who share their data and work for open science;   
setting up training programmes and mobilising the necessary resources to create an environment conducive to open data.  

Consequently, the member institutions of the Sorbonne University Alliance commit themselves to implementing the following recommendations for the opening of research data.  

# Recommendations for the opening of research data within the Sorbonne University Alliance  

To implement the policy of opening up research data, the institutions of the Sorbonne University Alliance have set themselves the following objectives:  

to raise awareness of open data among research staff in different communities and disciplines and promote the dissemination of good practice;   
to advise them on compliance with contractual requirements requested by funding agencies, drafting of data management plans, storage/archiving solutions and their cost, allocation of identifiers, and data curation, including for sensitive data;   
to work to facilitate the exchange of data and metadata between information systems according to the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles.  

In this perspective of opening up and sharing data, the members of the Sorbonne University Alliance recommend setting up a Research Data Helpdesk  in the form of a portal for access to available resources, making it possible in particular:  

to identify and promote standards, infrastructure, software and IT services for data to direct users to repositories where data can be deposited and described;   
to put users in touch with experts on technical, legal or innovation-related issues;   
to ensure pre-publication referencing of datasets;   
and to promote and use tools and services that support collaboration.  

It will be up to the institutions of the Sorbonne University Alliance to co-lead a working group for the construction, steering and management of this helpdesk.  

ble to integrate the services of this helpdesk into its own technical envi  

A sharing of resources is clearly desirable and beneficial, subject to prior agreement between the partners concerned.  

In the longer term, this helpdesk should also :  

allow secure access to sensitive or confidential data;   
support the management of 'long tail' data from disciplines that do not have their own research data management infrastructure;   
propose a solution to link researchers, publications, organisations and funding to the whole output, so as to provide opportunities for 'research in context'.  

In order to implement the proposed recommendations and come up with operational solutions, staff and financial resources will be needed in each of the institutions of the Sorbonne University Alliance.  

In addition to the initial funding that may be obtained with the PIA allocation, the institutions of the Sorbonne University Alliance undertake to :  

respond to regional, national or international calls for projects concerning the opening up of data, either individually or jointly, with the institutions keeping each other informed of any responses to calls for projects that they may make individually;   
ensure the sustainability of the services offered in terms of access to data and metadata, whether shared, stored or archived.
