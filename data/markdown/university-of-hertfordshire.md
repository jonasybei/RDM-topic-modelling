# Introduction  

1.1 The University operates in an increasingly complex, data-oriented, environment which requires the effective collection, management, analysis and dissemination of data.  The data generated and held by the University are key assets that must be managed correctly to underpin University strategic development, essential functions and academic integrity.  

1.2 This document:  

i provides a corporate framework with defined roles and responsibilities for the collection, quality, storage, security, maintenance and dissemination of institutional data;   
ii has as its basis the Key Principles set out in UPR IM021;   
iii has been approved by the Chief Executive’s Group2;   
iv should be read in conjunction with UPR IM021 and UPR IM113 and the following related regulatory documents: UPR IM204; UPR IM085; UPR IM096; UPR CA047 and UPR RE028.  

# (Note for guidance:

# 2 Definitions  

For the purposes of this document the definitions in UPR IM02 ‘Information and Data Management Principles’ will apply.  

# 3 Scope  

3.1 The University’s Data Management Policy applies to:  

i data, in all its forms - structured or unstructured -, required for the management and administration of the University and the conduct of its work, whether the data are captured and accessed from on-campus or off-campus locations;   
ii all University of Hertfordshire activities;   
iii individual Members of the University (see UPR GV069);   
iv the University’s wholly-owned subsidiary companies and their wholly-owned subsidiaries subject to the approval of their respective Boards of Directors;   
v collaborative activities undertaken with Partner Organisations;   
vi the management of research data.  

# (Note for guidance:  

The principles of the Data Management Policy (UPR IM16) also apply to document management and use.  Refer to (UPR IM11 for further information about University Records Management.)  

# 4 Policy  

4.1 All data created or owned by the University, its wholly-owned subsidiary companies and their wholly-owned subsidiaries, are the property of the University of Hertfordshire Higher Education Corporation and are regarded as corporate assets.  

# (Notes for guidance:  

o These data include, but are not limited to, data relating to management and administration and to the conduct of the University’s business.   
o Although responsibility for research data may be vested elsewhere, it should be noted that this policy and the principles and standards that it defines also apply to the management and use of research data (see section 7).)  

4.2 The University recognises the value of data as an institutional resource and considers that value to be increased through the widespread and appropriate use of data and by virtue of data quality.  

4.3 The University considers the value of data to be diminished through misuse, misinterpretation or unnecessary access restrictions.  

4.4 Access to data will be granted to Data Users for all legitimate University purposes, subject to any limited access restrictions that may be determined from time-to-time at the absolute discretion of the University.  

# (Note for guidance:  

Data access is determined on behalf of the University by the Chief Information Officer.)  

4.5 The University is committed to the Data Management Standards set out in section 5 of this document.  

# 5 Data Management Standards  

.1 The University categorises and determines data access as follows:  

5.1.1 ‘Internal’

# (Note for guidance:  

‘Internal’ is the default category for all data.)  

5.1.2 ‘Confidential’ or ‘Highly Confidential’  

i At the absolute discretion of the University, specific data may be categorised as ‘Confidential’ or ‘Highly Confidential’.   
ii Data will be categorised as ‘Confidential’ or ‘Highly Confidential’ by the Chief Information Officer in light of recommendations from Information Asset Owner and, where appropriate, legal and other advice.  

# (Note for guidance:  

The grounds for categorising data as ‘Confidential’ or ‘Highly Confidential’ include, but are not limited to, personal privacy, legal requirements, commercial confidentiality, security, externally imposed constraint or other recognised good reason.)  

5.1.3 ‘Public’  

i Data which, at the absolute discretion of the University, are determined to be a matter of public record and can, therefore, be made freely available, without restriction, are categorised as ‘Public’.

# 7 Unstructured Data  

7.1 Whilst structured data is usually held within a controlled environment on University servers, unstructured data (in the form of files and documents) are usually under the control of the user who created them, and stored in file storage where access cannot be so easily centrally regulated.  For this reason it is essential that the owners of those documents take responsibility for their security, dependent on the type of data which is contained within.  

7.2 The University provides advice and guidance on HertsHub on where documents should be stored and how they should be protected.  This guidance (which may change from time to time) must be followed in order to protect University data and personal and confidential data from accidental or deliberate leakage.  In particular, data classified as ‘Confidential’ or ‘Highly Confidential’ must be protected accordingly.  

7.3 The Head of the Strategic Business Unit which has responsibility for the file store in which unstructured data is held will be the Information Asset Owner where no other Information Asset Owner is defined.

ii retention of research data in sufficient detail for a defined period to enable appropriate responses to any questions about accuracy, authenticity, primacy and compliance with legal and regulatory requirements governing the conduct of research;   
iii for supporting investigation into any allegations of misconduct or regulatory breach (see UPR RE0213).  

8.3 This policy and the principles and standards that it defines also apply to the management and use of research data.  

# 8.4 Information Asset Owner - research data  

For the purposes of research data, the Principal Investigator or agreed equivalent role (such as the Principal Supervisor of Research Students) will fulfil the role and responsibilities of the Information Asset Owner for the purposes of the collection, management and retention of research data.  

(Note for guidance:  

For further information refer to ‘University Guide to Research Data Management’ (see Appendix III, UPR IM1616).)
