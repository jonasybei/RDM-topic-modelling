# I. Purpose & Scope  

King’s College London is dedicated to the advancement of knowledge, learning and understanding in the service of society. This policy sets out King’s College London’s requirements for the curation of research data in pursuit of this goal. The policy outlines a framework of support to enable the management of research data so that the benefits of open research data can be realized, subject to compliance with legal, ethical, regulatory, contractual, intellectual property protection and other legitimate requirements.  

The policy applies to all employees, honorary staff and affiliate staff of King’s College London who conduct research and research-related activities, and to postgraduate research students.  

In addition procedure statements 1.2, 1.3 and 1.4 apply to:  

undergraduate and postgraduate taught students who have obtained ethical approval for their research projects   
supervisors of those students specified above who are conducting high-risk research as per the university’s research ethics guidance Persons meeting this specification shall be referred to as ‘Researchers’.   
The policy does not apply to King’s Health Partners staff, although they are also encouraged to follow the policy’s principles.  

This policy takes into account the requirements of researchers at King’s College London; evolving policy and practice in scholarly communications; relevant legislation; the ethical conduct of research; and institutional strategies for research and innovation. These are described in more detail in the Research Data Management Procedure.  

# II. Principles  

Research data is a valuable resource in its own right. It validates research findings and has long term value as a potential resource for future research and teaching. Good practice in research data management benefits the wider research community and enhances the public value of research by:  

enabling the publication, sharing and citation of research datasets   
maximizing the impact of scholarly outputs   
enhancing the public visibility of funded research   
facilitating the reuse of data by future researchers   
avoiding duplication of data collection   
reducing the risk of data loss and corruption   
reducing the vulnerability of data due to file and software obsolescence   
enabling greater scrutiny of published research to affirm the robustness of findings  

This policy adopts the principle of making research data as open as possible, as closed as necessary1, recognizing that there may be legitimate reasons why certain data cannot be published openly. This policy also adopts the FAIR guiding principles, to enable data to be findable, accessible, interoperable and re-usable2.  

# III. Definitions  

Research data:  

While there is no single definition of data, research data can generally be defined as any representation or other objects that are created or gathered for the purposes of producing research or scholarship, and which can be used to validate or reproduce original research findings. The underlying research materials which support research publications can be described as research data. Research data can cover a diversity of form and content, including (but not limited to) numbers, text, images, audio, simulations, models, interview recordings, questionnaires, laboratory notebooks, videos, algorithms, codebooks, test results, specimens, databases or any combination of these. Data objects can be physical or print as well as digital. Research data held within King’s or hosted in external repositories is subject to this policy.  

Life cycle:  

Different elements of this policy apply to the way in which data is managed at different stages of research: during a research project; when research findings are published - either during or after a project; and when the project comes to an end.  

Dataset: Metadata: Repository: Open data:  

a set of files containing both research data, and documentation   
data or information about data which describes or contextualizes the data   
a system for storage and access of research data   
data that anyone can access, use and share  

# IV. Policy  

This policy requires that all King’s researchers (with some exceptions), whether externally funded or not, should:  

Create and maintain a data management plan for all projects handling research data   
Record sufficient metadata and documentation about research data during the course of the   
research   
Manage research data in compliance with legal, ethical, regulatory, contractual and   
Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) requirements throughout its life cycle   
Retain IPR in research data where possible and respect IPR contained in third-party data or   
that arising from multi-party collaborations   
Include a data access statement within research publications giving details of how data   
supporting the published results may be accessed   
Deposit research data in a repository or archive to ensure long term preservation and   
appropriate access   
Make research data which supports published research or that which has been retained   
following the end of a project openly accessible with as few restrictions as possible unless   
there are compelling legal, ethical, regulatory, contractual or IPR reasons not to   
Create and make publicly available a metadata record describing the data, to enable data   
discoverability  

Further detail on these requirements is provided in the Research Data Management Procedure.
