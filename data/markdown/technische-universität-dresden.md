## Guidelines on the handling of research data at TU Dresden  

These Guidelines have been adopted by the Senate of Technische Universität Dresden in its meeting on 13th June 2018.  

### Preamble  

The transparency of research is a key component of good scientific practice. It includes the responsible handling of research data as both the basis for one's own scientific research and the basis for further research - irrespective of the original purpose of data collection.  

In its 'Guidelines for Safeguarding Good Scientific Practice, Avoiding Scientific Misconduct and Dealing with Violations' (version of 5th March 2014), TU Dresden has stipulated guidelines for the handling of primary data in § 5. For the implementation of these guidelines and the handling of research data in general (i.e. beyond primary data), TU Dresden has adopted the following specific guidelines for the handling of research data.  

#### What is research data?  

Research data refers to all data collected, observed, derived, simulated or otherwise generated in connection with research. Research data is present in any scientific discipline in different forms and formats.  

### Guidelines  

1. Responsible research goes hand in hand with the conscious and careful handling of research data throughout its entire life cycle, as formulated by the German Research Foundation (DFG) in its 'Guidelines on the Handling of Research Data'. Research data management involves the planning, collection, processing, documentation, publication, and long-term storage of data.   
2. The responsibility for the research data management lies with the project leaders as well as the independent researchers. The structural units (Schools, Faculties or Institutes) can define binding rules for their areas of responsibility.   
3. For projects involving research data, a data management plan that documents the handling of research data should be established right at the project conception or application stage, based on general and subject-specific guidelines (e.g. of the funding bodies or professional associations).   
4. TU Dresden supports its researchers in the management of their research data through the Service Center Research Data (Kontaktstelle Forschungsdaten), which is jointly operated by the ZIH and the SLUB. It offers advice regarding the development of concepts as well as assistance providing tools for research data management. To optimally benefit from this service, early contact prior to or at the beginning of a project is recommended.   
5. TU Dresden provides a basic research data infrastructure, ensuring appropriate storage and the technical availability of digital research data.   
6. TU Dresden promotes and supports Open Access to research data. This is good scientific practice and of great importance for both the optimal exploitation of research results and the quality of research. The decision for any publication and its legal conditions is the individual researcher’s responsibility. The protection of personal data, ethical and copyright issues, obligations towards third parties, and exploitation interests should be given balanced consideration.   
7. In order to provide and re-use the data, the data as well as its context of origin and the tools used must be documented.   
8. Research data which forms the basis of a publication should be archived for the long-term in a suitable, trustworthy data archive or repository and/or published in a suitable form. It is an integral part of the researchers' scientific reputation.   
9. In order to sustainably establish and advance a high-quality research data management, its principles and methods should be anchored in teaching and continuing education.
