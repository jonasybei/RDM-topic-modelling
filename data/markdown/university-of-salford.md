# Research Data Management Policy  

Version Number 2.0  

Effective from 1 September 2024  

# 1.0 Purpose  

This policy outlines the University of Salford’s requirements for research data management before, during, and after a research project’s lifecycle. The University champions good practice in research data management because it is integral to high-quality research and aligns with funder requirements and the values and priorities set out in the Innovation Strategy 2021-26.  

Active management, secure storage and retention, and timely deletion of research data are necessary for research integrity, information security, and environmental sustainability. Making research data as open as possible and only as restricted as necessary is important to the University’s commitment to openness in research, supporting reproducibility and maximising the potential for re-use and impact.  

This policy is supported by, and should be read in conjunction with, the Research Data Management Guidance published on the Library’s webpages.  

# 2.0 Scope  

This policy applies to all research activities involving the collection, analysis, and storage of digital and physical research data conducted by University staff, postgraduate research students enrolled on a research degree, visiting or emeritus staff, associates, holders of honorary and clinical contracts, contractors and consultants and others working on the University premises or carrying out research activity in the name, or on behalf of the University of Salford, and across all subject disciplines and fields of study, hereafter referred to as ‘Researchers’.  

The policy does not apply to postgraduate taught students or undergraduates, but best research practice is recommended, and support and guidance is available to everyone.

# 4.0 Policy statements  

# Researchers’ responsibilities:  

# 4.1 Compliance  

All researchers are responsible for following their funders’ and the University’s policies for research data management (RDM), in particular the University of Salford Data Protection Policy, Information Security Policy and ICT Acceptable Use Policy and Academic Ethics Policy. All researchers are responsible for managing their research data in accordance with contractual, legislative, regulatory, ethical, and other specified requirements and as set out in the project’s Data Management Plan (see 4.3).  

# 4.2 Accountability  

The lead researcher (Principal Investigator or equivalent) on a research project is primarily accountable for RDM practices within the project. They must ensure that all research data are generated, stored, managed, and shared in accordance with contractual, legislative, regulatory, ethical, and other specified requirements, including any funder policies.  

4.2.1. The lead researcher must ensure that, where external partners are involved, research data ownership is established and confirmed contractually in advance of a research project starting, in accordance with the University's Intellectual Property Policy and relevant third-party agreements. They must ensure that any access to research data by third parties is managed in accordance with the Information Security Policy.   
4.2.2. Postgraduate research students are primarily accountable for RDM practices within their project. Supervisors of research students are responsible for ensuring that their students are adequately trained and have a clear understanding of RDM requirements and appropriate practice.   
4.2.3. RDM responsibilities can be shared or delegated but should be clearly documented in a Data Management Plan, and the lead researcher retains overall accountability. If leaving the University they must nominate a data steward, recorded in the Data Management Plan, to ensure the ongoing management, retention, and timely destruction of research data.  

# 4.3 Data Management Plans  

The lead researcher must ensure a Data Management Plan (DMP) is created for every research project which sets out how research data will be collected, classified, protected, prepared, securely stored, retained, and, wherever possible, shared. The DMP must be created before the beginning of the research project, typically at the funding application or ethical approval stage. DMPs are living documents which must be reviewed and kept up to date throughout the project. All members of the research project team must be aware of, and abide by, the DMP.  

# 4.4 Protecting sensitive data  

Researchers must protect sensitive data and the rights of research participants in accordance with legislation, contractual agreements, and ethical requirements.  

4.4.1.  Sensitive and confidential research data can be shared ethically and legally when this has been planned and agreed before collection, following relevant professional, ethical and discipline-specific standards. These include, but are not limited to, gaining informed consent from participants; protecting identities through anonymisation or pseudonymisation; and controlling access to data where necessary.  

# 4.5 Costs  

When developing a research funding application, researchers must include appropriate research data storage and retention costs, including any costs associated with the digitisation of physical research data. Where a project is not in receipt of external research funding, research data storage needs should be identified at the outset and, if these exceed the allowance provided by the University, suitable arrangements made to cover any additional costs.  

# 4.6 Storage during the project  

While in active use, researchers must ensure that research data are stored safely, securely and protected from loss using facilities appropriate to the data medium.  

4.6.1. Researchers must store digital research data on secure digital systems with a back-up mechanism to protect against loss. Where, due to the circumstances of data collection, research data needs to be temporarily stored on mobile devices or external storage, data classified as confidential must be encrypted and in all cases researchers must ensure data security in line with the Information Security policy.  

4.6.2. The loss of sensitive data or University IT equipment must be reported according to the ICT Acceptable Use Policy.  

# 4.7 Retention  

Researchers are responsible for selecting which research data to retain by considering potential long-term value, reproducibility of the research findings, and legal or funder requirements. Selected research data must be retained for at least any period stipulated by legal, contractual, regulatory, or ethical requirements, and in line with disciplinespecific norms, typically at least 10 years from publication.  

# 4.8 Depositing research data  

Researchers must deposit their selected research data in an appropriate data repository as soon as possible. Researchers may choose to use Figshare, the research data storage service provided by the University, or an alternative data repository which complies with legal, regulatory, and ethical requirements and aligns with FAIR principles to ensure data are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable. Access to deposited data can be restricted where necessary.  

4.8.1. Where research data are deposited in a repository other than the University’s data storage service, researchers must enter a metadata record into the University of Salford Institutional Repository (USIR).   
4.8.2. Where research data selected for retention are not in digital format, they should be digitised where possible. Where digitisation is not possible, researchers should seek to store the data in facilities appropriate to the subject matter and medium. To ensure these data are discoverable, a metadata record should be added to the University of Salford Institutional Repository (USIR).  

# 4.9 Preparation of data  

Researchers are responsible for preparing data prior to deposit and/or sharing. Before depositing research data, researchers must ensure that any sensitive data are prepared and protected in accordance with the consent given by participants, and any legal, contractual, regulatory, or ethical requirements (see 4.4).  

4.9.1. Research data held in any repository must be accompanied by metadata that clearly describe the data in sufficient detail to allow other researchers to find and understand them.   
4.9.2. Where research data have been made openly accessible, they should be accompanied by sufficient descriptive and technical metadata and documentation to enable reading, reuse, and interoperation by humans and machines.  

# 4.10 Data sharing  

Research data selected for deposit must be made as open as possible and only as restricted as necessary. To enable open data sharing and maximise reuse and reproducibility, researchers should choose the most permissive Creative Commons licence possible (e.g. CC 0 licence). Researchers should minimise the period of time for which they hold exclusive use of the data, as allowed by ethical, legislative, regulatory, commercial, and contractual conditions.  

# 4.11 Data underpinning publications  

A data access statement describing where supporting data can be found and accessed must be included in the publication when mandated by the research funder or publisher, even where the study generated no original research data, or the data are restricted or otherwise not accessible. In all other cases, a data access statement is strongly encouraged. Research data that underpins published research findings should, where possible, be made openly available at the time of first online publication.  

# 4.12 Data underpinning theses  

Where postgraduate research students have created or collected original research data which underpins the findings of their research, and these are not included in the thesis itself, they should ensure that selected data is stored in accordance with this policy. Research students are strongly encouraged to add a data access statement to the thesis. This statement should describe where supporting data can be found and accessed, even where the data are restricted or otherwise not accessible. Guidance is set out in the PGR Code of Practice.  

# 4.13 Disposal of data  

Researchers, or research data stewards, must securely dispose of research data identified for deletion or destruction with particular concern for the confidentiality and security of the data, in accordance with legal, contractual, regulatory, or ethical requirements and the University’s Information Security Policy.  

# University responsibilities:  

# 4.14 Research data storage service  

The University will provide a digital research data storage service which complies with legal, regulatory, ethical, and information security requirements. Research data in the University's research data storage service, Figshare, will be retained for the length of time detailed in the data management plan.  

4.14.1. Where research data selected for long-term retention are not in digital format and cannot be digitised, the University will support researchers to identify facilities and resources required for preservation within the data management plan.  

# 4.15 Guidance, training and support  

The University will provide support, guidance and training for researchers to enable effective research data management throughout the research lifecycle.  

# 5.0 Policy Enforcement and Monitoring  

Breach of this policy will be considered as having the potential to bring the University and its employees into disrepute and managed in that context. Specific processes will be brought to bear in this context, including the Research Misconduct Policy and Procedure, the Academic Misconduct Procedure, and the Disciplinary Policy.  

Periodic monitoring against this policy will be undertaken by The Library and Research and Knowledge Exchange (RKE) and be reported to the Research Enterprise & Innovation Committee (REIC).
