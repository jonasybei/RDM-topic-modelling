## About this Policy  

The mission of the University of Essex is excellence in education and research, for the benefit of individuals and communities. Our research will focus on asking difficult questions, challenging conventional wisdom, tackling with rigour the questions that matter for people and communities and putting ideas into action to improve people’s lives.  

The University of Essex recognises that sharing research data is an important contributor to the impact of research, increasing the visibility of research, reinforcing open enquiry and allowing results to be independently tested, improving the overall quality of research.  

### Purpose  

This policy sets out how research data at the University of Essex is managed throughout the data lifecycle so as to ensure transparency and appropriate access, supporting research funders, including UK Research and Innovation’s expectation to make research data arising from its funding as open as possible and as restricted as necessary. (See: Making your research data open – UKRI)  

### Scope  

This policy encompasses all data from research that has the potential for publication, regardless of whether or not the research is funded. It applies to doctoral and postdoctoral research and may apply to undergraduate and masters level research.  

# Research Data Management Policy  

### Research Integrity  

1. Research data must be managed to the highest standards throughout the research data lifecycle as part of the University’s mission for  research excellence and commitment to Research Integrity.  

2. The interests of human participants in research must be protected during all stages of the data lifecycle (See University of Essex Guidelines for Ethical Approval of Research Involving Human Participants) (.pdf).  

### Responsibilities  

3. Responsibility for managing data for any research project or programme lies with Principal Investigators or with individual researchers (academic staff or students) working on their own. All staff and students must follow the IT Acceptable Use Policy and our Information Security Policy (.pdf).  

4. The University is responsible for raising awareness of good practice and obligations with respect to research data, and for the provision of useful platforms, guidance, and services in support of current and future access, during and after completion of research projects.  

### Storage  

5. Research data must be offered and assessed for deposit and retention in an appropriate national or international data service or subject repository, or the University research data repository.  

6. University will, wherever practicable, provide mechanisms and services for secure storage, backup, registration (including ensuring that data has sufficient metadata and can be assigned a Digital Object Identifier (doi), deposit and retention of research data assets in support of current and future access, during and after completion of research projects.  

7. Any data which is created as part of research at the University, but which is retained elsewhere, for example in an international data service or subject repository, should be registered with the University through the University research data repository.  

### Security Sensitive Material  

8. Researchers, both staff and students (postgraduate and undergraduate), using security-sensitive material should be aware of and comply with the University’s Security-sensitive Research Material Policy and Procedures.  The University has separate secure storage for such material and a registration process.  

### Data Management Plans  

9. The Principal Investigators for each research project or programme are responsible for the creation and ownership of an appropriate research data management plan, aligned with the FAIR principles, and for ensuring that all members of the research team are aware of, understand and abide by the plan. When the project or programme involves collaboration with any external partner, there should be an agreement regarding the rights and responsibilities of each party with respect to data collected, including key decisions about data storage, backup and security, registration, access, transfer, retention, destruction or archiving and licensing.  

10. All research proposals must include research data management plans that explicitly address data types, formats and volume, capture, storage, management, documentation and metadata, integrity, confidentiality, retention and destruction, sharing and publication.  A suggested minimum period of retention is three years from the end of the project, however requirements by funders and data providers, as well as disciplinary guidance should be observed, as this it may be substantially greater. Data should be made available in perpetuity wherever possible.  

11. The University will provide training, support, advice and where appropriate guidelines and templates for research data management and research data management plans. Further information is available on data management plans and data protection and research activity.  

### Access and sharing  

12. Research data management plans must ensure that research data are available for access and reuse where legally, ethically and commercially appropriate, taking note of any relevant safeguards and with reference to the University Open Research Position Statement (.pdf). Data release will be timely, as appropriate to the nature of the research and the discipline.  Published research outputs should include a short statement describing how, and on what terms, any supporting research data may be accessed.  

13. In determining access rights for research data, the rights and freedoms of the subjects of research data must be safeguarded, in line with the University’s and the researchers’ obligations in law and with any provisions of the data management plan. The rights of citizen scientists and the public to access publicly funded research should also be considered. When open access to datasets is not legal or ethical, information governance restrictions on access and use must be applied as necessary.  

14. Written agreements are required when personal data (any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person) is passed from a data controller to a data processor or another data controller, or to a country not bound by the General Data Protection Regulation or equivalent privacy legislation. Written agreements are also useful when the data being shared although not personal data, are confidential or valuable to the parties involved.  The University’s Research and Enterprise Office can assist with providing templates for both incoming and outgoing research data and the drafting and negotiation of the agreements concerned. Exclusive rights to reuse or publish research data should not be transferred to commercial publishers or agents without retaining the nonexclusive rights to make the data openly available for re-use unless this is a condition of funding.  

### Policy ownership and review  

15. The Research Committee and the DITS Cyber Security Programme Board is responsible for reviewing and updating this policy on behalf of Senate.
