# Research Data Management Policy  

This policy lists rules and regulations designed to govern the operation of the Research Data Management on the compute server and the Euler cluster provided by the Genetic Diversity Centre (GDC).  

The GDC provides its users with a computational environment to collect, analyze, and store research data created in collaboration with the GDC or externally produced data. It also provides archiving solutions for completed projects. The GDC will provide support, training, advice and where appropriate guidelines and templates in all aspects of data management to ensure data integrity and user satisfaction. For more details about the different options and services provided by the GDC contact Aria Minder (aria.minder@env.ethz.ch).  

# Requirements  

All data managed on the GDC servers must be directly associated to at least one project listed in the GDC project database. Research data not produced at the GDC can be transferred, stored and analyzed on the GDC server if it is related to an active project. Please note that data transfer over 1TB requires the prior approval from the GDC, and a data integrity test after the transfer is strongly suggested.  

Once the project is completed, the data must be transferred off the server within 12 months. The GDC offers archiving solutions. Information about the project status can be obtained at any time.  

# Backup  

A backup is defined as a file stored on the backup server that matches a file on the compute server. Backups are intended to reduce the risk from disk crashes and user errors such as accidental deletion of files. All data on the GDC servers is regularly and incrementally backed up for a period of 2 weeks. After this time deleted or damaged data cannot be restored.  

# Ownership and Privacy  

The research data managed at the GDC servers belongs to the registered project leader. All users registered with the project can request access to the data and the server. The software licensed to the GDC and the tools written by the GDC cannot be copied or transferred without the consent of the GDC.  

# Liability  

The project leader is solely responsible for the project data. The GDC does its best to keep the data safe but cannot be held accountable for data loss. Therefore, the GDC highly recommends the project leaders to keep a copy of initial (raw) data and maybe the processed data if it is costly and time-consuming to reproduce.  

# Security  

All users with access to the GDC server have to follow the data protection principles. They must make sure the system is kept safe and secure by
