# 1. Introduction and purpose  

The University of Manchester recognizes the fundamental importance of research data and the management of related administrative records in maintaining quality research and research integrity and is committed to pursuing the highest standards. The University acknowledges that correct and easily retrievable research data are the foundation of and integral to every research study. They are necessary for the verification and defence of research processes and results. Research data have a long-term value for research and academia, with the potential for widespread use in society.  

The University endorses the Research Council Common Principles on Data Policy and requires all its researchers to adhere to them, as well as taking into account any other research data management requirements that may apply.  

The purpose of this Policy is to provide guidance and support on the responsibilities of the University and its researchers in managing and preserving current or future research data.  

# 2. Scope and definitions  

This Policy applies to:  

all research, regardless of whether or not the research is externally funded, and is subject to the provisions of any relevant contracts including funding/collaboration agreements; and all researchers active at The University of Manchester.  

Research is any creative and systematically performed work with the goal of furthering knowledge, including discoveries regarding people, culture and society, in addition to the use of such knowledge for new applications.  

Researchers refers to all research-active members of an institution including employees and doctoral candidates. Persons not directly affiliated with an institution, but who, for purposes of research, make use of or are physically present at the institution, are also included in the term. Visiting researchers or collaborators will also be expected to comply with the Policy.  

Research data is the evidence that underpins the answer to the research question and can be used to validate findings. This might be quantitative information or qualitative statements collected by researchers in the course of their work by experimentation, observation, modelling, interview or other methods, or information derived from existing evidence. Research data may take the form of numbers, symbols, text, images or sounds, including computer code, annotated fieldwork observations, or a descriptive record of a physical sample.  

Information store is where information is held/stored, for example, paper records in a filing cabinet, data held in IT systems, records stored onsite and offsite (e.g. in the Cloud), approved encrypted removable media. This list is not intended to be exhaustive.  

Information Store Owners are accountable for information held within the information store including the approval of any processing activities. For example, the Head of Research Governance, Ethics and Integrity is accountable for information processed in the Data Safe Haven. Where the  

information in an information store is created through many processing activities and accessed by many users (such as the University’s research studies) the Information Store Owner may delegate responsibility for the processing activities to a Processing Activity Owner.  Information Store Owners also include, for example, the creators of databases, spreadsheets, computer code or physical sample collections (this list is not intended to be exhaustive) where they may also be the Processing Activity Owner. The Information Governance Accountability and Assurance Framework Standard Operating Procedure describes the wider accountabilities of Information Store Owners.  

# 3. Intellectual Property Rights  

Intellectual property rights (IPR) are subject to the University’s Intellectual Property Policy. IPR might also be defined through further agreements e.g. grants, consortium agreements, or commercial agreements. Where no external agreement exists the University generally has ownership of research data generated in the course of research undertaken by researchers in its employment.  

# 4. Handling research data  

Research data is to be stored and made available for use in a suitable repository or archiving system, and whenever possible, provided with persistent identifiers.  

It is important to preserve the integrity of research data. Research data must be stored in an accurate, complete, unadulterated and reliable manner. Furthermore, they must be identifiable, accessible, traceable, re-usable, and whenever possible, interoperable and made available in a timely way with as few restrictions as possible.  

Research data is to be stored, made available and assigned a licence for open use in compliance with legal, ethical, and contractual requirements, and providing no funder, third-party or contractual rights prohibit it. Research data of future historical interest and the administrative records accompanying research projects should also be archived.  

Research data is a legitimate product of research and must be cited as such adhering to scholarly norms; re-used data must be explicitly traceable and original sources acknowledged.  

The minimum archive duration for research data and records are subject to the University’s Records Management Policy and Records Retention Schedule.  

In the event that research data and records are to be deleted or destroyed, either after expiration of the required archive duration or for legal or ethical reasons, such action will be carried out only after considering all legal and ethical perspectives. The interests and contractual stipulations of thirdparty funders and other stakeholders, employees and partner participants in particular, as well as the aspects of confidentiality and security, must be taken into consideration when decisions about retention and destruction are made. Any action taken must be documented and be accessible for possible future audit.  

5. Roles and responsibilities  

## 5.1 Researchers  

Researchers are responsible for:  

1. Management of research data in adherence with principles and requirements expressed in this Policy, and ensuring the appropriate security and integrity of the data, compliance with confidentiality undertakings and data protection law, and respect for ownership of IPR;   
2. Collection, storage, documentation, access to, and archiving or proper destruction of research data and research-related records. This also includes the definition of protocols and responsibilities within a collaborative research study. Such information must be included in a Data Management Plan (DMP), or in protocols that explicitly define the collection, administration, integrity, confidentiality, storage, use and publication of data. Researchers will produce a DMP for every research study;   
3. Compliance with the general requirements of the funders and the research institution; special requirements in specific studies must be described in the DMP;   
4. Planning to enable, wherever possible, the future re-use of data . This includes defining usage rights after a study has completed, with the assignation of appropriate licences, as well as specifying any data storage and archiving requirements;   
5. Compliance with all organisational, regulatory, institutional and other contractual and legal requirements, both with regard to research data, as well as the administration of research records (for example contextual or provenance information); and   
6. Registering new research studies at the proposal stage with The University of Manchester to ensure appropriate institutional support.   
5.2 The University  

#  

The University of Manchester is responsible for:  

1. Empowerment of organisational units, providing appropriate means and resources for research support operations, the upkeep of services, organisational units, infrastructures, and researcher education;
