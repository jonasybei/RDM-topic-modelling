# Guidelines for Handling Research Data at Technische Universität Braunschweig  

Preamble  

Research data are data that are collected as part of scientific projects, e.g. through observations, experiments, simulation calculations, surveys, researching sources, recordings, digitalisation or analyses.1 They are both the basis for scientific work and its results. Responsible management of research data and the software that creates this data serves to ensure that the research can be reproduced and validated, and in some cases enables the research data to be used again. Technische Universität Braunschweig supports its researchers in implementing quality-conscious data management for the purpose of ensuring good scientific practice and to promote more transparency in their research.  

Principles  

1) The researching members of Technische Universität Braunschweig are responsible for deciding which data is worth being archived and published as well as for documenting, providing and long-term archiving of the research data. By saving and archiving the data in a recognised repository,2 researchers fulfil their requirement to adhere to good scientific practice (archiving for at least 10 years).  

2) When managing research data, researchers ensure they adhere to ethical, data security, copyright or confidentiality principles.  

3) We recommend making research data and research software publicly available with an academic publication according to Technische Universität Braunschweig's open access guidelines.3 For this, it is recommended that researchers choose an open licence (e.g. Creative Commons) to make it easier for fellow researchers to use the data. This is done under consideration of requirements set by the research project's funding organisations and partners. FAIR Data Principles as well as software and data citation principles must be upheld.  

4) For saving the results of research projects, Technische Universität Braunschweig recommends planning research data management in the initial project planning phases, or when writing a grant application and creating a research data management plan at an early point in time. A data management plan documents how data is to be gathered, processed and saved from obtaining data to publication.  

Technische Universität Braunschweig commits to creating requirements necessary to fulfil these principles and, with its central infrastructure institutions — a cooperation among the Research Service and European Office, Gauß-IT-Zentrum and the University Library, to support researchers with appropriate measures for infrastructure, advising and continuing education.

These guidelines were passed by TU Braunschweig's Senate on December 13, 2017.
