# FACULTY GUIDELINES RESEARCH DATA MANAGEMENT  

Approved by the Faculty Board on November 10th, 2016  

On September 2nd, 2016, the UGent policy framework for research data management1 was approved by the Executive Board. This general policy framework is a guideline for the proper management of research data and defines the objectives, starting points and responsibilities to comply with this. Given the large differences between and within the different scientific domains, the faculties are given the authority to take initiatives. These initiatives must encourage and support faculty researchers with careful data management in accordance with the UGent policy framework. The guidelines below are therefore complementary to the general policy framework. While following these guidelines, legal, ethical and valorisation arguments must always be considered.  

## Planning  

At the start of each research project or a series of related studies, a data management plan (DMP) is made available by the responsible researcher. To help, use can be made of the faculty template on DMPOnline.be. This DMP is kept up-to-date as the project progresses.  

### Storage & preservation of research data  

Where possible, research data is stored (during a project) and preserved (after a project) on a central network drive (i.e.., a UGent share managed by DICT).   
The researcher gives at least reading rights on the network disk to his hierarchical superior using the following functional sequence: doctoral student < (co-)promotor2/ZAP < chair department < chair CWO). With an eye toward the structured storage of research data, researchers are provided with 'best practice' examples. The objective is to use a uniform folder structure for each type of data.   
When a researcher leaves the university, he/she and his/her supervisor take the initiative to keep the research data and accompanying documentation available and accessible during the applicable preservation period.   
Non-digital research data should preferably be digitized. If this is not possible, it should be stored in the faculty archive for research data.  

### Findability & comprehensibility of research data  

Research data are documented to such an extent that reproduction of the reported results and reuse of the data is possible.   
For every publication of which the first author is a UGent employee, a data storage fact sheet is made. This is then added to Biblio and provided with the 'data fact sheet' tag3.  

## Support  

Novice PhD students are advised to follow the RDM workshop organized at the beginning of each academic year.   
For advice and assistance with all aspects of good data management, you can contact the faculty Research Support Office (RSO).
