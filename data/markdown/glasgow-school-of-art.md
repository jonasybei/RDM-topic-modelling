# 1.  Introduction  

This policy outlines the approach of Glasgow School of Art in relation to research data management and curation.  

Within the context of this policy, research data should be interpreted as any material (whether digital or analogue) that underpins the production of research outputs.  

Research data means data in the form of facts, observations, images, computer program results, recordings, measurements or experiences on which a research output is based. Data may be numerical, descriptive, visual or tactile. It may be raw, cleaned or processed, and may be held in any format or media. Research data in the visual arts mirrors the complexity of the outputs, taking many forms including logbooks, journals, workbooks, sample libraries, sketchbooks, sets of images, video recordings, trials, prototypes, ceramic glaze recipes, found objects, and correspondence. Provenance information about the data might also be included: the how, when, where it was collected and with what (for example, instrument). This metadata facilitates later interpretation and re-use of data.  

Modern research and publishing environments provide increased opportunities to make research data openly available in order to:  

validate research outputs increase and measure impact facilitate knowledge exchange communicate research to wider society  

The Glasgow School of Art recognises that its research data is a key asset that can be managed to maximise benefits to the individual researcher, wider society, our funders and stakeholders, and the School.  

# 2. Principles  

# 2.1 General  

1. Research produced by the Schoolâ€™s researchers, staff and students should strive to achieve the highest standards of integrity and quality   
2. Research data will be managed in line with wider School policies, guidelines and standards, and the requirements of external funders  

# 2.2 Communication and Dissemination  

3. The Research Information Manager and Heads of Schools are charged with communicating this policy to their researchers, along with the importance of good data management in general  

# 2.3 Management Plans  

4. Research proposals should include research data management plans where appropriate. These plans will generally consider data capture, management and curation, storage, handling, retention, dissemination, and publication   
5. Lead researchers are responsible for ensuring that research data management requirements are observed at all stages of a research project   
6. The Research Information Manager will provide guidance and support to help researchers negotiate the deposit, storage, retention and dissemination of research data  

# 2.4 Data Retention  

7. Data should be retained intact in an appropriate secure format, normally for a period of 10 years from the date of publication, depending on funder requirements  

8. Where retention is not required, data must be disposed of securely in line with Data Protection requirements  

# 2.5 Deposit  

9. Research data should deposited and retained in an appropriate institutional form, or national or international repository. Information about data which is retained outside of the RADAR institutional repository or the GSA Archives should be registered with the School.  

10. The Glasgow School of Art will provide mechanisms and services for storage, backup, registration, deposit and retention of research data assets appropriate to the formats and media.  

# 3. Roles and Responsibilities  

Research data management bestows a number of obligations on both individual researchers and the School.  

# 3.1 The Glasgow School of Art  

The Glasgow School of Art is committed to supporting its researchers by providing an environment that recognises and supports research excellence. The School aims to provide the highest quality support at all stages of the research process.  

Research Developers within the Research Office can provide advice and guidance on research bids, funding streams, and methodologies. The Research Information  

Manager within Learning Resources can provide guidance and support in the management and curation of research data, including access, maintenance, preservation and sustainability.  

# 3.2 Individual Researchers  

The School expects individual researchers to:  

Undertake research in line with the standards outlined in our Research Ethics Policy   
Work within all relevant legislative frameworks, including Data Protection and Human Rights legislation, particularly in relation to sensitive data Seek advice on data management from the Research Information Manager where required, particularly in order to identify key data for retention Liaise with IT Services to identify potential data storage requirements Provide metadata upon request to enable access and re-use Submit research data to an appropriate institutional form, or national or international repository. Information about data which is retained outside of the RADAR institutional repository or the GSA Archives should be registered with the School
