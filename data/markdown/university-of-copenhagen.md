# Policy for Research Data Management  

# 1. Preface  

# 1.1 Introduction  

Research data management is a collective term for the planning, collection, storage, sharing and preservation of research data, and it therefore covers the entire research data lifecycle (Figure 1). Good management of research data contributes to improved efficiency and transparency of research processes, and to increased reliability and reproducibility of research results. Thorough planning can ensure compliance with legislation, promote a clear division of responsibilities between collaborators, and safeguard secure storage and handling of data to prevent loss or misuse. For the individual researcher, good data management can lead to improved visibility and impact of their research, for example by facilitating the reuse of their data sets by others.

# 1.2 Purpose  

The policy’s objective is to outline requirements for the management of research data, and enable researchers and students to follow good scientific practice within their discipline, while adhering to laws covering research data management. The University of Copenhagen (UCPH) is committed to the highest standards of excellence in research and will support the competences necessary to adhere to this policy through training, support, advice, guidelines, tools and templates for research data management, where appropriate.  

# 1.3 Scope  

1.3.1 This policy is relevant to anyone conducting or supporting research activities at the University of Copenhagen. Among others, this includes scientific staff, PhD students, visiting and affiliate researchers, collectively referred to as researchers. It includes research support staff, such as laboratory technicians and data managers, when they manage research data as part of research projects at UCPH. Lastly, it includes students in the following situations: 1) when they carry out their own research projects as part of their Bachelor’s or Master’s degree programmes and 2) when they contribute to research projects at UCPH, for example in the role of project member or employed student assistant.  

1.3.2 The policy covers physical material and digital data collected, observed, generated, created or reused as part of research activities conducted at UCPH, collectively referred to as research data in this policy unless specifically stated otherwise. This includes any physical material and digital data that form the basis of the research, such as specimens, notebooks, interviews, texts and literature, digital raw data, recordings and computer code, as well as the detailed records of these materials and data that comprise the basis for the analysis underlying the results.  

This policy applies to all research data collected, observed, generated, created or reused after 11 January 2022 (the publication date of this policy). It does not cover data collected and used solely for teaching activities1.  

1.3.3 The policy adheres to the relevant legislation and follows the Danish Code of Conduct for Research Integrity, the UCPH Code of Conduct for Responsible Research as well as other university policies, such as the Information Security Policy and the Policy on Research Planning and Conduct.  

1.3.4 In relation to the specific research area and the individual research project, it must be assessed whether and to what extent the data management policy, or parts of the policy, are relevant.  

# 1.4 Faculty implementation  

The faculties (deans) are responsible for the implementation of this policy at the faculties. Deans must ensure that a plan and a timeline for the implementation of this policy are developed at their faculty (also see 3.5). Where necessary, faculties, departments, research groups, PhD schools, etc. may introduce more specific requirements, procedures and guidelines for the implementation of the policy according to local practice.  

# 2. Principles  

# 2.1 Data management plans  

2.1.1 The management of research data must be thoroughly considered before physical materials and digital data are collected, observed, generated, created or reused. Data management plans (DMP) must be developed and documented, preferably in electronic format. As a minimum, the topics addressed in this policy (clauses 2.2-2.7) must be reviewed, for example by using the DMP template provided at UCPH. DMPs should be updated when significant changes to the management of research data occur and (references to) the DMP should be stored with the corresponding research data as long as they exist.  

2.1.2 The DMP should be discussed with project collaborators, research managers and supervisors (if any), ensuring that agreements are reached regarding responsibilities for different research data management activities during and after research projects.  

# 2.2 Rights to research data  

2.2.1 Rights to research data must be clarified at the start of research projects. Unless legislation states otherwise, or agreements have been made to determine otherwise, the following is the default at UCPH:  

a. In accordance with the general rules of copyright during employment, researchers hold the copyright to books and articles they publish as a result of research projects carried out at UCPH.   
b. UCPH holds the copyright to software created by employees during the performance of their work.   
c. UCPH holds the rights to research data in the shape of physical objects collected by researchers during their employment at UCPH, such as biological and geological samples, notebooks, paper interviews and books. These objects may not be removed without permission.   
d. A copy of digital data sets and associated metadata must remain at UCPH when employment ceases. As a minimum, this applies to data sets underlying publications.   
e. In accordance with the Danish Act on Inventions at Public Research Institutions, UCPH has the right to acquire researchers’ inventions and to ask researchers to postpone publication of such inventions for a short time period.  

In addition, the following should be clarified:  

f. To what extent research data can be accessed in the project. For example, in projects involving personal data, it must be clarified to what extent rules of data confidentiality impose limits on data access, and how these limits will be upheld.   
g. Who can access and manage the research data, and within which timeframe.   
h. When and to what extent research data may be used for other purposes, for example in other research projects. It should be determined what rules apply if a project member leaves the project and/or UCPH.   
i. Whether research data can be shared after project end, and if so, what the terms of data reuse by others will be.   
j. Intellectual property rights, including whether the research project makes use of material that interferes with the rights of others, and how the necessary approvals should be obtained to clear these rights.   
k. The legislation, policies or agreements governing the above, including whether there are special loyalty or confidentiality obligations.   
l. Any research data management requirements by research funders, partner organisations, etc.  

2.2.2 The University’s Tech Transfer Office must be involved as early as possible in the negotiation of all third-party contracts containing provisions on intellectual property rights, such as non-disclosure agreements, material transfer agreements and collaboration agreements. Patentable inventions must be reported to the Tech Transfer Office in accordance with the Act on Inventions at Public Research Institutions.  

# 2.3 Ethical and legal approvals  

2.3.1 It should be ensured that the appropriate ethical and legal approvals are obtained before the start of a project, and (references to) the approvals should be stored along with the research data, as long as they exist.  

2.3.2 Strict legal and local requirements exist for projects involving personal data.  

Among others, projects in which personal data are being processed (including biobanks) must be registered at UCPH, and approvals to process personal data must as a minimum be filed in the University’s archiving system. Conditions for transfer of personal data and material between UCPH and external collaborators or a third party must be captured into agreements.  

# 2.4 Collection, processing and documentation  

2.4.1 Research data should be collected and processed in line with best practice in the research discipline. Research projects should be documented in a way that allows them to be repeated by others. Among other things, this includes clearly and accurately describing project methodology and any equipment, software or code used.  

2.4.2 Research data should be described using appropriate metadata to facilitate searching for, the identification of, and the interpretation of the research data. Metadata should be linked to the research data as long as they exist, unless legislation or agreements state otherwise.  

# 2.5 Storage and security  

2.5.1 Research data must be classified at the start of a research project on the basis of the level of sensitivity and the impact to the University if data are disclosed, altered or destroyed without authorisation. Risks to data security and of data loss should be assessed in relation to the data classification. This includes evaluating:  

a. Physical and digital access to research data   
b. Risks associated with data management procedures   
c. Backup requirements and backup procedures   
d. External and internal threats to data confidentiality, integrity and accessibility   
e. Financial, regulatory and technical consequences of working with data, data storage and data preservation.  

2.5.2 Risks to data subjects’ rights and freedom must be assessed in projects involving personal data and a risk assessment must be conducted and recorded when registering projects at UCPH. In some cases with a high risk for the data subjects, a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) must also be carried out as part of the registration process.  

2.5.3 Infrastructure for storing and processing research data, and for collaborating in research projects, must be chosen in accordance with the identified risks, and in compliance with UCPH’s Information Security Policy and the legal requirements for processing personal data.  

# 2.6 Data sharing  

2.6.1 Legislation or agreements may preclude research data sharing or impose conditions for sharing. Before sharing research data, the relevant approvals need to be obtained and, if necessary, the appropriate agreements set up to allow data and material sharing.  

2.6.2 By default, research data should be made openly available after project end, as a minimum for data sets underlying research publications. Concerns relating to intellectual property rights, personal data protection, information security as well as commercial and national interests and legislation must be taken into account in accordance with the principle of ‘as open as possible, as closed as necessary’.  If the research data cannot be made available, sharing the metadata associated with the research data should be considered.  

2.6.3 The FAIR principles (for findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable research objects) should be followed as much as possible when preparing digital data sets that can be shared. This includes as a minimum:  

a. Providing open access to data (Open Data) by depositing data in a data repository, or by providing access to information on whether, when, how, and to what extent data can be accessed if data sets cannot be made openly available.   
b. As much as possible using persistent identifiers (PID) and metadata (such as descriptive keywords) that help locate the data set.  

UCPH Policy for Research Data Management  

c. Communicating terms and conditions for data reuse by others, for example by attaching a data licence.   
d. Providing the information necessary to understand how data sets were created and structured, and for what purpose.  

The level of compliance with the FAIR principles, in addition to the minimum requirements described above, is defined by the individual research discipline in relation to international norms and standards in that discipline.  

# 2.7 Long term preservation  

2.7.1 Appropriate arrangements for the long-term preservation of digital data, physical material and associated metadata must be made, adhering to legislation and/or agreements. This should include:  

a. Deciding which research data will be preserved. As a minimum, data sets underlying published research results must be preserved so that any objections or criticisms can be addressed.   
b. Deciding how long research data will be preserved. Data sets underlying research publications should be retained for at least five years after project completion or date of publication, whichever comes last.   
c. Choosing a format and location in which research data should be preserved, and deciding what metadata should be associated with the preserved data and material.   
d. Deleting/destructing research data if legislation or agreements exclude preservation, or when researchers and their managers determine that preservation is not required (for example when research data can easily be reproduced) or not possible (for example when research data are too costly to store or when material quality will deteriorate over time).   
e. Assigning a person, persons or role(s) responsible for the research data after project end. Responsibilities include safeguarding the long-term integrity of data sets.   
f. Determining rights, for example, of access to and use of preserved data sets.  

2.7.2 A copy of data sets and associated metadata must remain at UCPH after project end and/or when employment with the University ceases, in a way in which they are accessible to research managers and understandable for research managers and peers, unless legislation or agreements determine otherwise. As a minimum, this applies to data sets underlying publications. Responsibilities for and rights to these data sets must be agreed upon.  

2.7.3 Digital research data sets must be registered at project end if the research falls within the scope of the Executive Order on the Registration of Digital Research Data created by State Authorities, so that the Danish National Archives can assess the data sets’ potential for longterm preservation. The National Archives may subsequently request a copy of the data to be transferred to the archives. Data in these projects can only be destructed if the National Archives issue a disposal provision after their assessment.  

2.7.4 Personal data can only be preserved   
a. if anonymised   
b. at the Danish National Archives   
c. when there is a legal basis for the long term preservation of personal data in a secure database, biobank or other collection for research purposes.  

2.7.5 A plan for research data preservation and/or destruction must be developed, in alignment with legislation, (local) guidelines and agreements (if any), and the continued need for preservation should be reviewed on a regular basis.  

# 3. Roles and Responsibilities
