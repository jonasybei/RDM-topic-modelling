# Preamble  

Today, a responsible approach to digital research data is one of the cornerstones of transparent, high-quality, visible, and sustainable research. Freie Universität Berlin supports its members (researchers, instructors, and students) in implementing the relevant principles in alignment with the German Research Foundation’s Guidelines on the Handling of Research Data1 and Guidelines for Safeguarding Good Research Practice,2 Freie Universität Berlin’s Statute for Safeguarding Good Scientifc Practice,3 Freie Universität Berlin’s Open Access Policy,4 the FAIR Data Principles 5 as well as other recommendations6 regarding the entire research process, from data collection to the publication of research fndings. Above and beyond these basic principles, Freie Universität Berlin believes that in the long term, research data are useful not only in a scientifc context, but also have the potential to be used and distributed throughout society in accordance with the principles of open research (open science, open scholarship). The university encourages a culture of dialogue as a basis for developing quality assurance concepts for research data in the various departments and subject areas.  

# 2 Scope  

This policy applies to all members of Freie Universität Berlin 7 as well as to visiting researchers and guest lecturers, and partners and institutions with which the university holds a cooperation agreement. Where specifc funding agreements with external funders stipulate other rules on data management, those rules take precedence. The binding policies of Freie Universität on data protection 8 and IT security 9 also apply.  

# Defnition  

This policy applies to all research-related analog data, documents, and objects that are to be digitized in the course of a given research process as well as to “born digital” (i.e., originally created in a digital medium) data, documents, and objects produced in the course of a research process and/or that are the object or result of such a process. Research data are also defned as any data that facilitate the documentation, transparency, and – depending on the research area – replication of research outcomes (metadata).10  

Common examples of such research data are digitizations, audiovisual data, digital representations of analog data, measurement data, observation data, survey data, texts and text editions, databases, object collections, protocols, methodological test procedures, questionnaires, sofware, and simulations.11 The German Research Foundation (DFG) also defnes source code and sofware as research data where they represent central outcomes of scientifc research.12 The broad spectrum of data types refects the diversity of scientifc disciplines and their diferent research methods and processes.  

In the course of the research process, research data can take on several forms. They may vary in quality depending on how they are prepared or if additional data are added. The form of the data may also depend on the stage of processing, or they may be provided in diferent formats for presentation purposes. Furthermore, they may be subject to varying access regulations (open data, restricted data, closed data).  

The management of research data is an ongoing part of the entire research process. It includes the organization, documentation, storage, back-up, archiving, sharing, and publication of data. Research data management not only increases the visibility of the generated and/or processed data, but also the related research. It also helps to improve data quality and data processing, while making subsequent use of the data easier both for the original researchers and for others. Moreover, it facilitates the use of data in new contexts created when diferent data sets are linked. Sustainable research data management ensures the fulfllment of subject-specifc requirements, as well as potential obligations related to funding agreements. It also helps meet publishers’ standards and requirements, as well as ensuring compliance with the principles of good scientifc practice.  

# Handling Research Data  

Freie Universität Berlin encourages researchers to structure and archive their research data and to make these accessible in accordance with the FAIR principles. These principles aim to make digital data more fndable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. Research data should be managed in a way that is compatible with the relevant subject-specifc practices, with the principles of ethical research, 13 and the guidelines and recommendations issued by professional associations in the relevant subject.14 Freie Universität Berlin adheres to the principles of the “Sorbonne Declaration on Research Data Rights,” 15 and recommends that researchers work on the guiding principle of “as open as possible, as closed as necessary.”  

# 4.1	 Research and Project Planning; Administering and Managing Research Data  

It is recommended that project leaders include the costs of resources required to store and manage data (staf costs, project-specifc hardware and sofware, charges for use) in grant applications. Even if funding institutions do not require it, Freie Universität Berlin recommends that researchers create a data management plan (DMP) as early as possible. The DMP should include details on how data will be collected, administered, secured, stored, used, and published. It should also include an agreement on data organization, the assignment of responsibilities, intellectual property,16 regulations regarding staf fuctuation, as well as specifcations on data access. The data management plan should be reviewed regularly in the course of the research project and updated whenever necessary.  

Descriptive metadata should be linked to the research data on an ongoing basis as an integrated part of the research project rather than waiting until the project is completed. It is also essential that the methods and tools used to generate, enrich, structure, and analyze the data are documented in full. This ensures compliance with quality standards, helps to keep the process transparent, and also ensures that the research can be replicated in accordance with the respective subject-specifc norms. The University Library can help with choosing suitable tools for this process.  

# 4.2	 Publishing, Licensing, Storing, and Archiving Research Data  

Machine-readable, processable research data can be deposited, referenced, and made accessible in diferent repositories. Depending on the project, researchers might choose a domain-specifc repository, a subject-specifc repository, or Freie Universität’s own institutional repository, “Refubium.”17  

Where intellectual property or data protection legislation or the principles of ethical research require restricting access to research data, Freie Universität ofers technical archiving solutions. 18 If there are reasons why research-relevant data are not to be stored, this should be documented in accordance with the recommendations on good scientifc practice. If the research data are archived but not published, Freie Universität recommends that the metadata are deposited in Refubium to ensure the maximum visibility and long-term citability of research outcomes.  

The University Library assists members of the university in documenting and cataloguing their data for publication 19 and in using sustainable and/or open standard formats 20.  

If usage or publication rights are to be transferred, use of the data for academic purposes should be guaranteed on a perpetual basis. Freie Universität Berlin therefore recommends granting open licenses for use when data (including their metadata) are published, e.g., CC0 or CC BY 21 for data, GNU General Public License 22 or MIT License 23 for source code. Data should be assigned persistent identifers, e.g., Digital Object Identifers (DOIs).  

The University Library ofers this service free of charge. 24 For the citation and/or referencing of data 25 and sofware 26, researchers should refer to established standards.  

Research data must be stored and made accessible for as long as required and possible according to the recommendations and rules of research funders within the framework of statutory and legal provisions (e.g., the EU regulations on personal data [GDPR], intellectual property law). The minimum time for which research data should be stored is usually ten years from the date of publication of the data or the relevant work and/or the end of the project. 27 Freie Universität’s institutional storage systems (ZEDAT; Refubium) ensure that data are stored for at least this long.  

If research data are to be deleted from the institutional storage systems, then this must be done in agreement with the relevant researchers as well as the infrastructure providers (i.e., the University Library and ZEDAT) following the expiry of the required archiving period and in compliance with all legal and ethical requirements. The decision as to whether to retain or delete the data should take into account the interests and contractual obligations of external funders and/or other stakeholders, such as cooperation partners, participating research institutions, etc.  

# 5 Legal and Ethical Considerations  

Research data management must always and at all times take into account the current statutory requirements, especially in relation to the protection of individuals and of intellectual property (copyright law, General Data Protection Regulation), as well as the requirements of this policy, subject to special arrangements with third parties (e.g., research groups, joint projects) and to ethical considerations.  

The ownership of usage rights is regulated in the employment contract between the researcher and Freie Universität and/or other specifc agreements with the researcher. The rules stipulated in other agreements (funding agreements, cooperation agreements, research permissions) and the rights and standards applicable to the persons and groups, if any, who form the object of the research also apply. It may be necessary to carry out individual assessments of cases where ownership of the intellectual property in relation to the data is vested solely in the researcher(s) and/or specifc research institutions.  

# 6 Responsibilities  

# 6.1 Research and Teaching  

Members of Freie Universität Berlin are bound by the principles of good research practice set out by the German Research Foundation (DFG). Freie Universität’s statute on safeguarding good scientifc practice 28 stipulates that researchers must ensure that the research data created and processed in the context of their research project must be, wherever possible, organized, documented, made accessible, and stored in a long-term and sustainable way. The researchers at Freie Universität are responsible for implementing the various rules and guidelines that apply to their research, including rules and standards issued by their respective departments and in consideration of all ethical and statutory requirements.29  Proper handling of research data is also highly relevant in the context of teaching and education. Members of Freie Universität do their best to ensure students and researchers for whom they have a responsibility are aware of the various methods of research data management applicable to their respective subjects 30, whether this is in teaching and training (especially research-oriented teaching), research-based internships, projects, or fnal theses.  

# 6.2 Institutional Obligations  

The University Library provides consultations on the organizational, legal, and ethical aspects of research data management, as well as on questions related to information science in this context. It ofers support to researchers, especially in designing a research data management plan, and in selecting and implementing the best archiving and, where applicable, publishing strategy. Where researchers are dealing with more complex requirements, the Ofce of the General Counsel, the Central Ethics Committee, and ZEDAT also ofer advice on fnding tailored solutions for specifc legal, ethical, and technical issues. The University Library also supports researchers through training in basic skills and norms in relation to research data management. It can advise the departments and other units in setting up and developing their own training programs, e.g., for Collaborative Research Centers (CRCs). ZEDAT ofers one-on-one consultations for researchers along with workshops for small or large working groups on subjects such as computation for scientists, fnding the right sofware, and identifying capacity needs, for example, for big data projects 31.  

The Open Access Policy of Freie Universität Berlin 32 encourages the idea that publishable research data should be accessible, and the university supports all researchers in making this possible as well as supporting recognition for data publications and developed sofware. The university strongly recommends that researchers consider and implement the relevant practices when handling research data in the context of assessing fnal theses and dissertations, in evaluations, and recruitment and appointment procedures. Freie Universität Berlin is also working toward the establishment of research data management as a core aspect of the curricula in all subject areas and in the courses ofered by the central facilities as part of its endeavors to embed good scientifc practice in all areas of the university.  

# 7 Entry into Force  

This policy was approved by the Academic Senate of Freie Universität Berlin on May 5, 2021, and thereby entered into force.  

The University Library will be responsible for coordinating a review of this policy every two years with the participating central ofces and committees to evaluate its validity in order to adapt it to new challenges, developments in infrastructure, and the needs of researchers.  

Compliance with statutory and regulatory norms (including data protection legislation) is regularly monitored.  

The University Library is the point of contact for any questions related to this policy (forschungsdaten@fu-berlin.de).
