Research data are the foundaƟon and the result of scienƟfic work. The responsible handling of research data ensures replicability, verifiability and reusability of research results and is thus a fundamental aspect of good scienƟfic pracƟce. Justus Liebig University acknowledges the importance of sustainable research data management and regulates the handling of research data for all members of the university in the following principles, irrespecƟve of data protecƟon requirements and the guidelines for ensuring good scienƟfic pracƟce.  

1. Research data refers to all data that are gained in the process of doing research through observaƟon, collecƟon, measurement, experiment, simulaƟon and processing or that are the result thereof. This also includes the documentaƟon and soŌware necessary for the understanding of such data. Depending on scienƟfic discipline and faculty culture, research data can exist in different types, aggregaƟon levels and formats.   
2. Research data management includes all handling of research data, ranging from planning the data collecƟon and storage to assuring data quality and processing data to making data available or publishing it. Research data management is oriented towards the current professional standards and takes discipline-specific requirements into account. Handling research data will be documented in a research data management plan at an early stage of a research project and, if necessary, is to be adjusted to the process of the respecƟve project.   
3. According to research data management, researchers are required to secure research data safely, appropriately process and document research data, and store research data in the long-term (at least for 10 years). The protecƟon of personal data as well as compliance to copyright and legiƟmate interest of third parƟes must be ensured. The principal invesƟgators of research projects are responsible for guaranteeing these processes.   
4. Justus Liebig University recommends you give access to your research data as early as possible using relevant disciplinary or interdisciplinary repositories according to the principles of Open Access. The point in Ɵme and the condiƟons of giving access to research data fall under the responsibility of the researchers.

5. It is to be aimed for embedding the methods and processes of discipline-specific research data management into teaching and research.  

Justus Liebig University supports the implementaƟon of these guidelines through consulƟng services for all fields of research data management.
