Research data are the founda on and the result of scien fic work. The responsible handling of research data ensures replicability, verifiability and reusability of research results and is thus a fundamental aspect of good scien fic prac ce. Justus Liebig University acknowledges the importance of sustainable research data management and regulates the handling of research data for all members of the university in the following principles, irrespec ve of data protec on requirements and the guidelines for ensuring good scien fic prac ce.  

1. Research data refers to all data that are gained in the process of doing research through observa on, collec on, measurement, experiment, simula on and processing or that are the result thereof. This also includes the documenta on and so ware necessary for the understanding of such data. Depending on scien fic discipline and faculty culture, research data can exist in different types, aggrega on levels and formats.   
2. Research data management includes all handling of research data, ranging from planning the data collec on and storage to assuring data quality and processing data to making data available or publishing it. Research data management is oriented towards the current professional standards and takes discipline-specific requirements into account. Handling research data will be documented in a research data management plan at an early stage of a research project and, if necessary, is to be adjusted to the process of the respec ve project.   
3. According to research data management, researchers are required to secure research data safely, appropriately process and document research data, and store research data in the long-term (at least for 10 years). The protec on of personal data as well as compliance to copyright and legi mate interest of third par es must be ensured. The principal inves gators of research projects are responsible for guaranteeing these processes.   
4. Justus Liebig University recommends you give access to your research data as early as possible using relevant disciplinary or interdisciplinary repositories according to the principles of Open Access. The point in  me and the condi ons of giving access to research data fall under the responsibility of the researchers.
