## Preface  

The Faculty of Technology, Policy, and Management Research Data Management Policy is part of the central TU Delft Research Data Framework Policy. The Faculty of Technology, Policy, and Management Research Data Management Policy helps create effective practices for working with research data at the faculty, and defines data management roles and responsibilities of the different stakeholders within the faculty.  

Note that the Faculty of Technology, Policy, and Management Research Data Management Policy only specifies the Roles and Responsibilities of faculty-specific stakeholders. TU Delft Research Data Framework Policy should be consulted about the roles of the Library, ICT Department, University Services and the Executive Board at TU Delft.  

This Policy is motivated by the belief that good data stewardship leads to research that is more time- and cost-efficient and it is inspired by principles that research data should be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR).  

### This policy cultivates:  

: Best practice for ensuring that scientific arguments and results are reproducible in   
the long term.   
: Better exposure of academic work of researchers at TU Delft leading to recognition of quality of the research process as a whole.   
: Responsible management of research data, including the safe storage of research data and protection of intellectual capital developed by scientists across TU Delft.   
: Improved practices for meeting the demands of funders and publishers with respect to research data management and sharing.  

### This policy recognises that:  

: Individual departments and research groups have different working practices and processes and will therefore require dedicated guidelines – this document focuses on the aspects of research data management applicable to all departments. : Data management is the entire process of managing research data from its creation to its re-use and preservation and it is not equal to Open Science. While it is beneficial to publish research data openly, there might be valid ethical, legal or commercial implications, which will make data unsuitable for open sharing. . "Relevant research data" might mean different things in different disciplines. Source code, experimental notes, protocols, models, and other forms of information supporting traditional publication are also within the scope of this policy.  

The policy is applicable to all researchers of the faculty (PhD students, postdocs, researchers and project leaders). However, the research activities of students, such as bachelor and master students’ projects, are out the scope of this policy. In such cases, we encourage students and supervisors to follow the principles of this policy, but this does not constitute a requirement.  

### The key points of this TPM Research Data Management Policy are:  

. This policy is a refinement of the TU Delft Research Data Management Framework policy   
. This policy is applicable to all research activities performed by researchers (including PhD students), but do not apply to Bachelor and Master students’ activities. . This policy focuses on how data should be managed but does not specify which data should be managed. What constitutes “relevant research data” is domainand activity-specific, and is therefore left to researchers’ interpretation, based on the standards of their research community.   
: All relevant research data and code needed to support and/or reproduce research findings are appropriately documented and archived at the end of a research project   
. All archived research data and code should be made as F.A.l.R. as possible : All archived research data and code have a clear licensing scheme and the data should be “as open as possible, and as closed as necessary”   
: Research data retention period is fixed to a minimum of 10 years   
: Data Stewards assist researchers in these activities   
. This document will be revised regularly (every 2 years)  

This policy enters in application on the 1st of January 2020.

From the TPM  Mission Statement: https://www.tudelft.nl/en/tpm/about-the-faculty/organisation-chart-facts-figures/mission/  

The Faculty of Technology, Policy and Management combines insights from the engineering sciences with insights from the humanities and the social sciences. The Faculty’s mission is to develop robust models and designs in order to solve the complex challenges of today’s networked, urbanized knowledge society.  

The Faculty is comprised of three closely collaborating departments, each with a different perspective on addressing these complex societal challenges: systems, governance and values. The smart combination of these three perspectives is at the core of Comprehensive Engineering, and is the main thrust of the Faculty. The main application domains of the Faculty, in which the majority of its research projects can be clustered, are: energy, climate, mobility, ICT, water, and cyber.
