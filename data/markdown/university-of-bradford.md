# Policy  

## 1 Introduction  

1.1. High quality data management and storage is the cornerstone of excellent research and a key aspect of responsible research conduct. The University of Bradford recognises that research data is a valuable institutional asset and should be managed in line with the UKRI’s Common Principles on Research Data.  

1.2. Most research funders, including all research councils under the auspices of UKRI, Wellcome and charity funders have data management and sharing policies, and Data Management Plans (DMPs) are now a key part of most funding applications.  

1.3. Well managed data enables research data to be securely and reliably stored long term. It enables discoverability, accessibility and reuse where appropriate, and it supports transparency and scrutiny, facilitates collaboration and encourages the ethical re-use of data to maximise the intellectual, social, cultural and economic impact of the University of Bradford’s research.  

1.4. The University supports the Concordat on Open Research Data and UKRI’s Common Principles on Research Data.  

1.5. The aim of this policy is to ensure that researchers manage their research data effectively, enabling them to:  

Demonstrate the rigour and integrity of their research.   
Ensure that data are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable.   
Follow university, ethical, legal and funder requirements in relation to research data and the management of research data.   
2.1 The Policy applies to researchers: any person who conducts research, including but not limited to: an employee; a research supervisor; a visiting researcher; an independent contractor or consultant; postgraduate research students; postgraduate taught students; a visiting or emeritus member of staff; an undergraduate student; a member of staff on a joint clinical or honorary contract, and/or a public contributor to research. The Policy applies to all subject areas of the University.   
2.2 This Policy applies to all research irrespective of how it is funded.   
2.3 This Policy supports and complements the Code of Practice for Research, Publications and Open Access Policy, Data Protection Policy, Research Data Management IT Security Guidance, Ethics Code, Ethical Framework, Freedom of Information Policy and the Intellectual Property Policy.   
2.4 Research and Innovation Committee owns this Policy and oversees research data management policy implementation via an oversight committee for research computing and data management.   
2.5 The Deputy Vice Chancellor (Research, Innovation and Engagement) is responsible for ensuring that this policy is regularly reviewed and fit for purpose.  

Data Management Plan: A Data Management Plan (DMP) is a formal document that outlies how date are to be managed during the lifetime of a project and after the project has been completed. It Is the basis of effective research data management.  

Data Steward: A data steward is an oversight or data governance role on a research project.  

Research: For the purposes of this policy, “research” refers to the definition used by the Research Excellence Framework 2021:  

“Research is defined as a process of investigation leading to new insights, effectively shared”.  

“It includes work of direct relevance to the needs of commerce, industry, culture, society, and to the public and voluntary sectors; scholarship; the invention and generation of ideas, images, performances, artefacts including design, where these lead to new or substantially improved insights; and the use of existing knowledge in experimental development to produce new or substantially improved materials, devices, products and processes, including design and construction. It excludes routine testing and routine analysis of materials, components and processes such as for the maintenance of national standards, as distinct from the development of new analytical techniques. It also excludes the development of teaching materials that do not embody original research.”.  

“It includes research that is published, disseminated or made publicly available in the form of assessable research outputs, and confidential reports1”.  

Researcher: The University of Bradford’s Code of Practice for Research defines researchers as: any person who conducts research, including but not limited to: an employee; a research supervisor; a visiting researcher; an independent contractor or consultant; a postgraduate research students; postgraduate taught students; a visiting or emeritus member of staff; an undergraduate student; a member of staff on a joint clinical or honorary contract, and/or a public contributor to research.  

Research Data: is the evidence that underpins the answer to the research question and can be used to validate findings. This might be quantitative information or qualitative statements  

collected by researchers in the course of their work by experimentation, observation, modelling, interview or other methods, or information derived from existing evidence. Research data may take the form of numbers, symbols, text, images or sounds, including computer code, annotated fieldwork observations, or a descriptive record of a physical sample.  

Research Data Management: Research data management is an explicit process covering the creation and stewardship of research data and materials to enable their use for as long as they retain value2  

Principal Investigator (PI): A principal investigator is usually a member of academic staff responsible for the administration and conduct of a research project.  

Persistent Identifiers (PID): A persistent identifier is a permanent, unique reference to an object independent of storage location. The identifier ensures machine readability and that one can always find the object, even if its name or storage location changes3. Examples of PIDs include digital object identifier (DOIs) and Open Researcher and Contributor ID (ORCID).
