# Guidelines for Responsible and Sustainable Research Data Management at KIT  

(RDM Policy)  

## Preamble  

Responsible handling of research data is indispensable for reproducing scientific findings and making them accessible and usable for science and the society. Protection, storage, and sustainable supply of research data require application of specific standards and compliance with legal framework conditions, with particular attention being paid to the observation of data protection regulations and of the general right of privacy. Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KiT) supports its scientists in implementing the guidelines for research data management at KIT to safeguard good scientific practice and in using existing services and infrastructure facilities for this purpose.  

### Guidelines  

1. Research data management starts with the planning of research projects and includes the acquisition, processing, and storage of research data. It guarantees access or access restrictions, reproducibility, and reuse of research data.   
2. The researchers shall be responsible for research data and compliance with specific standards. Coordination of research data management shall be in the responsibility of the heads of institutes and other scientific organizational units.   
3. KiT shall provide advice relating to research data management in research projects, from planning to execution to beyond the completion of the project. Advice shall consider discipline-specific requirements, such as the selection of suited repositories and data formats.   
4. KIT shall provide appropriate storage facilities for research data. For this purpose, it shall make available controlled accesses and an appropriate infrastructure.   
5. KiT shall support free access to research data taking into account ethical, legal, economic, and contractual framework conditions.
