# University of Aberdeen Research Data Management Policy Supporting Researcher-Centred Data Management at the University of Aberdeen  

As an organisation which creates and uses knowledge to make a difference, the University of Aberdeen wishes to make its research outputs (publications and the underlying research data) as freely available as possible, with the minimum of delay.  At the same time, we ensure that we meet all legislative and ethical obligations to protect the rights and privacy of individuals and minimize the potential for harm. We comply with UKRI’s Common Principles on Data Policy and the Concordat on Open Research Data.0F1  

Managing and sharing research data effectively is fundamental to facilitating high quality research practice, supporting our commitment to research excellence and good research governance.  

The University outlines below the main principles of the policy for the appropriate management and sharing of all research data1F2 that is generated as a result of University research activity, throughout the life of the project and beyond, to ensure that researchers comply with legislative, funding body, data owner, and internal policy and audit requirements, and that, where appropriate, the data remains discoverable, available and usable over time, for future validation, access and re-use.  

The University aims to support the open research agenda for both data and publications to make data more accessible to researchers and to share resources across institutions in order to create impact, recognition, curation, and influence, and ensure longevity and visibility.  

## Scope  

The policy applies to all staff that are authorised to use the University’s name and services in the course of their research, including postgraduate students and visiting, honorary, and emeritus staff.  It also applies to staff supervising student research projects. University use of NHS and clinical data is subject to additional governance.  

## Roles and Responsibilities  

1. The Principal Investigator (PI) is responsible for compliance with this and related policies, research data management practice2F3 deposition and publication, in accordance with relevant University policies, legislation, funder, and data owner terms and conditions.  Where the research is externally funded, and the funders allow, the Principal Investigator is responsible for the recovery of costs of data storage and curation.  Principal Investigators are also required to participate in relevant training offered by the University of Aberdeen.  

2. All research data gathered by students during their study are the responsibility of the supervising staff member (PI/lead supervisor), to manage in accordance with the requirements of this policy and institutional guidance.  

3. Effective research data management practice3F4 is a shared responsibility between individual researchers, University management, and professional services.  

4. The University will provide support, guidance, and information on appropriate research data management activities, including planning for funding applications, availability of internal and external data repositories, licensing of datasets, and allocation of persistent identifiers for data sets.  Further guidance on the associated roles and responsibilities for this policy is available here.  

### Deposit and Publication  

5. All research data of potential current or future interest, or that which substantiates published research findings, should be assessed by the Principal Investigator for deposit in an appropriate data repository.  

6. The Principal Investigator has a responsibility to assess which research data should be offered for deposit; to identify an appropriate repository; to specify appropriate levels of access to the data; and to consult relevant third parties (e.g. research participants; academic and non-academic partners) in making these decisions.  

7. Research data should be published/made publicly accessible as soon as possible, and typically on publication of the results.  Embargo periods are acceptable and should take account of funders’ requirements, disciplinary practice, and commercial value.  It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator or successor data owner to adhere to funder requirements for data publishing and, where necessary, to negotiate an extension to restrictions on placing data in the public domain.  

8. When a data set is published, the Principal Investigator or data owner is required to select an appropriate licence under which their data will be made available.  The Principal Investigator or data owner will need to ensure that the licence permits sharing and re-use of data in accordance with funder requirements and the terms and conditions of this policy.  Institutional support and guidance are available here.  Electronic data published in the institutional repository will be catalogued using structured metadata which includes details of licencing and a persistent digital object identifier (DOI).  

9. The University of Aberdeen retains the right to re-use research data or make it openly available for others to re-use.  Exclusive rights to re-use or publish research data should therefore not be handed over to commercial publishers or agents without retaining the rights to make the data openly available for re-use, unless this is a condition of funding or other agreed third-party rights.  

10. A central record of known datasets deposited in public access repositories, including our institutional repositories, will be maintained in the institutional research information system.  The deposit of a data set in an external publicly accessible repository should be notified to (opendata@abdn.ac.uk)  to enable the cataloguing of metadata.  

### Data Management Practice  

11. All personal data4F5 must be collected and managed in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation ((EU) 2016/679) and the UK Data Protection Act 2018, or successive legislation. Standards and procedures for processing personal data are set out in the University of Aberdeen Data Protection Policy.  

12. Where required, research proposals should include a Data Management Plan 5F6 (DMP), or equivalent protocol for the management of data, that addresses key elements of data management practice throughout the research project and for the longer term.  

13. Data retention, preservation, accessibility, and deletion will be managed in line with relevant legislation, policies, contractual obligations, funder requirements and, where appropriate, in line with consent obtained from research subjects.  

13.1 Holding data for longitudinal studies or to enable data collection and aggregation over time, as defined by the project, can also be considered, but must take account of all the above.   
13.2 In any case, data should be retained for a minimum of 5 years from project end date.   
13.3 Data should not be kept any longer than is necessary without reasonable justification and appropriate authorisation/consent.  

14. Where funders allow, all costs associated with data management practice should be recovered from funders.
