The University of Greenwich is committed to expanding the total proportion of our research and scholarship outputs, and their underlying research data, that are published in open access (OA) forms.  

The university is committed to enabling its active researchers to share the results of research through a range of open means in order to maximize research impact within the academic research community and across society more broadly. The university also supports the use of research identifiers for all researchers, such as ORCID; it is currently mandatory for anyone on a research career pathway to obtain and use their ORCID.  

This statement and the policies that follow support the activities of many key research funders that now make the OA publication of outputs and data a condition of funding. This includes Research England, which requires articles and conference papers accepted for publication to be available in an appropriate open access format in order to be eligible for the Research Excellence Framework (REF).  

The following policies apply to all staff and any postgraduate students actively engaged in research activity:  

# Publications Policy  

There are two main routes to OA for publications, known as Gold and Green. The university holds a general preference to follow the Green route for publications by depositing appropriate copies into a recognised OA repository. Consequently, all staff and postgraduate students must make a record in the University of Greenwich Academic Literature Archive (GALA) for all published research outputs. For articles and conference proceedings (with an ISSN), an accepted manuscript must be uploaded to GALA within three months of acceptance, and the embargo period must not exceed a 12 month maxima (Panels A & B) or a 24 month maxima (Panels C & D1.)  

Where researchers use the Gold route to OA, whether in a gratis OA journal, through the university’s participation in a Transformative Agreement with a publisher, or supported by project funds, a record of the output must still be added to GALA.  

Where an author is licensing their research outputs and publications under an open or Creative Commons licence, the university takes a scholar-led approach. As such, the licensing decision is the responsibility of the individual researcher, unless they are in an agreement with a research funder or other associated external organisation that frequently mandate the use of specific open licences.  

In order to optimise the potential impact of research outputs, this policy strongly recommends the most open licence available in order to help maximise impact potential and allow the university to actively contribute to the construction of the scholarly commons. Where institutional funds are involved in the access to an opportunity to openly license an output, such as through participation in a Transformative Agreement, open licensing opportunities should be agreed with Research Development Services.  

In support of this policy, the university commits to support and train academic and research staff in understanding OA and the Research England policy for REF, as well as choosing journals and licences that allow outputs to be compliant with institutional external policies and mandates.  

The university also commits to maintaining GALA, optimising it for emerging publication types and supporting its ongoing use with training and online materials.  

GALA forms an institutional record of the research and scholarship published by the university's research community, helping to protect and preserve the scholarly record. Records are anticipated to be kept permanently, but where appropriate, the Takedown Policy exists to fairly handle the removal of any records as required.  

# Research Data Policy  

The university takes the definition of research data as:  

“evidence that underpins the answer to the research question, and can be used to validate findings regardless of its form (e.g. print, digital, or physical) … [including] statistics, collections of digital images, sound recordings, transcripts of interviews, survey data and fieldwork observations with appropriate annotations, an interpretation, an artwork, archives, found objects, published texts or a manuscript” (The Concordat Working Group, 2016).  

Making research data accessible for reuse and to increase its potential impact is a key objective for UK Research Councils, and they have played a leading role in the development of the Concordat on Open Research Data on which this policy document is based.  Other funding agencies such as UK Government Departments, EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation and various charitable foundations have developed policies to encourage more open access to research data.  In addition, journal publishers are advocating that access to the underlying data should be an intrinsic part of the academic publishing process.  

In accordance with the principles laid out in the Concordat on Open Research Data, all appropriate data generated by projects supported or led by University of Greenwich staff, as appropriate, shall be made openly available with as few restrictions as possible. When legally, commercially and ethically appropriate, data will be uploaded to an appropriate funder repository2 in a timely and responsible manner. If an appropriate data repository cannot be found, datasets must be uploaded to GALA.  

Data should be retained for a minimum of 10 years from the end of the project, or from publication of an output relating to the research, whichever comes first. Where funder or other legal requirements specify a longer retention period, this should be observed.  

Research data that must be retained after project completion include:  

a. Data that support research findings3,   
b. Data that are of potential long-term value,   
c. Data that support patent applications   
d. Data which are subject to other legal requirements for data retention.  

Researchers should avoid retaining data solely using methods that might not persist for 10 years, such as on project websites, personal computing equipment or in formats limited to proprietary software. Researchers are permitted to have an embargo period on their research data to complete their work, publications, or intellectual property filing on that data, before release.  

Datasets hosted in funder or subject repositories must still be registered with the university, either during the closure of a project, or by contacting researchsupport@gre.ac.uk.  

All research proposals must include a data management plan, regardless of whether it is required by the funder. Researchers should also ensure that research proposals include a budget, where applicable, to cover the costs of managing research data in both the short and longer term.  

All data handlers and processors have responsibilities for the data collected, created, stored, and/or preserved. However, the Principal Investigator (PI) may have overall responsibility for the implementation of data management plans of a research project, in order to ensure that research data are available for access and re-use where appropriate and with the necessary safeguards. All of this must be undertaken in line with the university’s relevant policies4.  

The university recognises its responsibility to ensure researchers are supported throughout the research process to ensure full compliance with funder data policies and contractual requirements on research data management. The university commits to support academic and research staff in choosing a repository as well as writing data management plans, selecting and appraising data for storage, and in understanding and meeting any other requirements.
