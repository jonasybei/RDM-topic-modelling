# 1. Policy Statement  

1.1. As one of the leading research-intensive universities in the world, the University of St Andrews places high value on the research conducted under its auspices; whether produced solely within its academic schools, its centres/institutes or as result of research pooling. More information on the University's research activities can be found at https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/research/  

1.2. The University is committed to excellence throughout its activities. These activities increasingly collect and produce raw and processed research data, much of which is valuable and needs to be retained over the long term. This applies equally to all disciplines.  

1.3. The purpose of research data management is to ensure that research data is managed according to good practices for collection, curation, storage, management, retrieval, re-use, sharing, archiving, preservation and access, as appropriate for the data and discipline concerned, to support researchers to:  

1.3.1. maximise the academic value of research data;   
1.3.2. meet the expectations set out in the University's relevant policy and guidance (see Section 2.3);   
1.3.3. comply with any applicable requirements of funding agencies and other stakeholders;   
1.3.4. where personal data is involved, protect the privacy of research participants by safeguarding their data; and   
1.3.5. follow the FAIR guiding principles for data management and stewardship.  

1.4. The University expects that all research data will over time be made publicly available wherever possible consistent with any constraints necessary to meet funding requirements, statutory or ethical responsibilities, and as appropriate to the field or discipline. Our guiding principle is ‘as open as possible, as closed as necessary’.  

1.5. Data should, whenever possible, be deposited into an appropriate long-term archive. Such archives include national or international subject-specific archives, secure repositories for data with extreme confidentiality requirements, or a managed University repository (e.g. Pure). For the personal data of study participants, the measures indicated on the relevant ethical application form and communicated to the study participants must be adhered to when depositing data in a repository.  

1.6. Data underpinning publications should be made openly available wherever possible, with explicit Data Access Statements provided in publications. Data should have persistent identifiers to support citations, and be accompanied by rich metadata (including a description) to increase discoverability as recommended by the FAIR principles (paragraph 1.3.5).  

1.7. All research articles must include a Data Access Statement. Statements should enable citation of underpinning research data by providing a location with a unique identifier (DOI) and any terms of access. When there are no data associated with the article or the data are inaccessible a Data Access Statement must still be included stating the reason(s) why the data cannot be made available.  

1.8. The University will maintain a central catalogue of metadata descriptions for indexing, archiving, naming, and retrieval of datasets and other objects, and will register the DOI or other stable name of all objects being managed to support uniform treatment.  

# 2. Scope and responsibilities  

2.1. This policy applies to all researchers and research data as defined in Section 3. This policy applies to all research irrespective of funding.  

2.2. Within its statutory and other requirements, the University seeks to leave as much control over the data lifecycle with the researchers concerned.  

# 2.3. Researchers:  

2.3.1. Should develop a data management plan for the data to be collected and securely managed; protecting individuals and the University from accidental or malicious data loss. Such plans should include issues of confidentiality, retention, sharing, publication, preservation and open access, and describe how the collection of data and metadata will be integrated into their everyday research processes so as to make compliance with the data management plan, ethics requirements and legislation as simple as possible;   
2.3.2. Should allocate appropriate resources (time and financial resources) for research data management in grant proposals;   
2.3.3. Should deposit their data in accordance with this Policy (see Section 1.5); and   
2.3.4. Must act in accordance with other relevant University policies, referring to relevant guidance where provided: the Principles of Good Research Conduct, Data Protection policy, and Information Classification Policy.

2.4. Principal Investigators/Group leaders/Supervisors should ensure that they and the researchers they manage receive appropriate induction, training and support in the handling, curation and archiving of research data and that the expectations set in this policy are met.  

2.5. Heads of School should provide oversight of data management within their Schools.  

2.6. The University has a responsibility to ensure that systems are in place to support and reinforce good research data management. The University will provide:  

2.6.1. Advice and guidance on the management of personal and otherwise sensitive data in line with legislation and how legislation supports academic research Contact: dataprot@st-andrews.ac.uk   
2.6.2. Within cost constraints, access to services and facilities for the storage, backup, registration, deposit, curation, archiving and preservation of research data. See the Digital Preservation Policy: https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/policy/library-and-museumservices/digital-preservation-policy.pdf   
2.6.3. Advice, support, guidance and training on best practice in research data management. See https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/research/support/open-research/research-datamanagement/   
2.6.4. Advice and support on the implementation of this policy and the implications for different disciplines. See https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/research/support/openresearch/research-data-management/contact/   
2.6.5. Advice and support in writing data access statements   
2.6.6. Support for researchers requiring reasonable adjustments due to protected characteristics. Contact: diversity@st-andrews.ac.uk  

# 3. Definitions  

3.1. Researcher is defined as any person conducting research under the auspices of the University, including staff and students.  

3.2. Research data are defined as the data, software and code, objects, materials, primary sources, or artefacts that would be used to reproduce/retrace the published outcomes of research or otherwise support research findings, whether physical or digital. For a full definition and examples see https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/research/support/openresearch/research-data-management/working-with-data/what-are-data/  

3.3. Personal data is defined in the UK Data Protection Act 2018 as ‘any information relating to an identified or identifiable living individual’.  

3.4. Data Access Statement: a statement points the reader of a publications to where the underpinning data are deposited by means of a URL, ideally in the form of a persistent identifier (DOI), and provides information on how they can be accessed. In cases where data is not made available, the statement provides reasons.  

3.5. FAIR principles: a set of principles guiding researchers, institutions and publishers on how to make the data findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable.
