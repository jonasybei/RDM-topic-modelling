University of Lincoln: Research Data Management Policy  

## Research Data Management Policy  

Version 2.0  

Date: 25 May 2018  

The purpose of this policy is to set out the University's expectations for the management and curation of research data across all academic disciplines and in all forms. The University recognises the value of sharing research data openly where appropriate as a way to promote scholarly discourse and support learning and teaching and therefore aspires to be a leader in open data practices.  

This policy is applicable to all staff and students and should be read in conjunction with the University's Code of Practice for Research, which reflects the principles and commitments outlined in the Concordat to Support Research Integrity, the University’s Open access publications policy and Research Ethics Policy.  

The University of Lincoln recognises that the curation and sharing of research data is key to its mission to develop and create knowledge. This brings benefits to the University, its members and the public through greater opportunities for access and re-use. Research data is defined as data acquired or generated in the course of research undertaken at the University and its management refers to storage, preservation, discovery, and provision for access and re-use.  

The University recognises and supports the UK Research & Innovation Common Principles1 on Data Policy mandates as best practice for data curation and sharing.  

This policy aims to address the requirements of researchers, the public, funding and statutory bodies and commercial partners and set out the principles to ensure that research data will be managed, curated and shared to the highest standards throughout the research data lifecycle.  

1. Researchers should consider data creation, management and sharing in a ‘Data Management Plan (DMP)’ which should explicitly address data capture, protection, management, integrity, confidentiality, evaluation, retention, sharing and publication. DMPs should take into consideration compliance with relevant legislative frameworks which may limit public access to data (e.g. in areas of data protection (point 5), intellectual property and human rights). Further details on DMPs are available from the Digital Curation Centre2.   
2. While a DMP, or its equivalent, is sometimes a requirement of the research funding, it is considered best practice for all research.   
3. Responsibility for research data management through a sound DMP during any research project or programme lies primarily with the researchers.   
4. The University will provide training, guidance and support for the development of DMPs or its equivalent and their implementation.   
5. Where research data may contain personal information about identifiable individuals, the relevant data protection laws must be considered and a Data Protection Impact  

Assessment (DPIA) may need to be conducted in collaboration with the University’s Data Compliance Officer prior to any personal data being collected.  

6. Researchers should record the existence of research data upon creation or access and deposit it according to their plan. This should be in compliance with timeframes for preserving access that are part of the external contract (often within six months of publication of research findings).  

7. Research metadata will be published (where appropriate) for permanent citation in the Lincoln Repository alongside conventional outputs such as journal articles and conference papers where appropriate.  

8. Access to research data will be granted under appropriate safeguards according to conditions and timeframes specified by researchers, commercial partners and funding bodies.  

9. It is the responsibility of the researcher to ensure all research data that support and substantiate published research findings are offered to an appropriate repository for long term storage and public access, where permitted. This may be funder or discipline specific, or, where no external repository has been identified, may be within University storage facilities.  

The University aims to provide the infrastructure and expertise for long-term curation, preservation and access to research data. This includes secure services for storage, backup, registration, deposit and retention of research data assets in support of current and future access, during and after completion of research projects.  

Costs to meet the specific requirements of Data Management Plans should be included in grant applications, where permitted. The University will develop appropriate plans and budgets for meeting the costs of long-term storage, preservation and curation of research data.
