1. Introduction  

1.1 Cardiff Metropolitan University recognises that the maintenance of accurate and retrievable data arising from the work of its research community is vital to good practice in research conduct.   
1.2 In addition, it is widely accepted that publicly funded research data are a public good which should, wherever possible, be made openly available with as few restrictions as possible in a timely and responsible manner, as set out in RCUK’s Common Principles on Data Policy.   
1.3 It is recognised that there is much progress to be made at Cardiff Met in relation to research data management and that it will take time to support and encourage changes in research practice related to the archiving and sharing of research data.   
1.4 This being the case, it is expected that this policy will, in the first instance, be fully adhered to only in relation to externally funded research projects.  It is nonetheless the ultimate aim that all research carried out by staff and students at Cardiff Met will be conducted within the auspices of this policy.  This will be achieved via a phased implementation of a programme of support which will encourage changes in research data management practices across the institution.  

# 2. Definitions  

2.1 The institutional Data Management and Governance Policy defines data as distinct units of information such as numbers, letters or symbols, usually formatted in a specific way.  For the purposes of this policy, the term research data is clarified as information gathered through the pursuit of research activity.  Such information may be in a variety of forms including quantitative data, interview recordings or transcripts, video or audio recordings.  

# 3. Link to other institutional policies  

3.1 This document sets out the overarching policy in relation to research data management at Cardiff Metropolitan University.  It does however link to several other institutional policies and procedures and should therefore be read in conjunction with them.  Of particular significance are:  

Open Access Policy   
Policy on storage of Research Data   
Procedures for ethics approval   
Research Misconduct Policy   
Data Management and Governance Policy   
PREVENT Policy  

# 4. Storage, retention and sharing of data: expectations  

4.1 The production of open research data is acknowledged as a legitimate output of the research process. This being the case, research data produced by Cardiff Metropolitan University will be accurate, complete and reliable and every effort will be taken to ensure data are identifiable and retrievable, and openly available where appropriate.  Data shall be stored in a manner compliant with legal and ethical obligations as well as any requirements specific to the funder of the research.  Where issues of confidentiality and/or anonymity arise, these shall be of paramount importance when considering how and where data will be stored and made available.  

4.2 Data will be stored in a secure repository suited to the data set concerned. Where data are stored in an external repository, full details of the location of the data will be registered with the institution and details will be attached to any relevant publications by the Library.  

4.3 Data supporting and underlying published research outputs will, wherever possible, be made available upon publication of the output and will be preserved for an appropriate period.  To enable this, sufficient metadata will be recorded and made available to enable others to understand the research and re-use potential of the data. Published outputs will include information on how to access the supporting data.  

4.4 The minimum period for retention of research data will be ten years from the date of publication.  However where the funder of the research requires a longer retention period, this will be adhered to.  

4.5 Retention periods will be decided as part of the Data Management planning exercise. Once the initial retention period as stated in the Data Management Plan has lapsed, a review will take place to assess whether the data should be retained for a further period.  Data with acknowledged long-term value will be preserved and remain accessible and usable for future research.  Conversely, data which has attracted little interest for more than ten years will not be expected to be retained.  

4.6 The storage of outputs and data derived from undergraduate or taught post graduate research projects will be subject to the expectations of this policy where it is the intention to publish the results of the research.  In cases where there is no intention to publish, the storage of the outputs and data will be governed by the regulatory arrangements of the relevant award.  

4.7 It is recognised that there are instances where it is necessary to restrict access to research data however, any access restrictions placed on data must be justified and justifiable.  It is anticipated that such restrictions will be related to the maintenance of confidentiality, the protection of the privacy of research participants, commercial sensitivity or issues related to IP.  

4.8 Where confidentiality provisions apply, data will be kept in a way that reference to them by third parties can occur without breaching such confidentiality.  Confidentiality agreements to protect intellectual property rights may be agreed between the institution, the researcher and a sponsor of the research. Where such agreements limit free publication and discussion, limitations and restrictions must be explicitly agreed.  

# 5. Data Management Planning  

5.1 Cardiff Met recognises that, in order for data to be openly discoverable, accessible and useable, the management of data must be considered from the beginning of the research process.  Therefore, in order that issues related to the collection and generation of data are considered at the earliest possible stage, Principal Investigators will develop a Data Management Plan as part of the planning stages of their research project.  

5.2 The Data Management Plan will consider issues related to data collection, storage and backup of data, data preservation and data sharing. Academics will be supported in the development of their Data Management Plan by relevant support staff based in central units and their School or Unit.  

# 6. Responsibilities  

6.1 The development of open research data depends on the ability of all involved to understand their responsibilities and to optimise their own opportunities.  

6.2 Cardiff Met expects individual researchers to be responsible for:  

Ensuring that their own  knowledge in relation to data management is sufficient to meet their obligations.  This will include familiarity and adherence to the Research Councils UK Common Principles on Data Policy. Managing research data and records in accordance with the principles and expectations of this policy. Consideration of how they will manage the data they collect and generate at an early stage of research planning using a Data Management Plan.  This should include planning for ongoing custodianship of their data after the research has been completed and consideration of where data will be located and stored should they leave the institution.   
? Ensuring any requirements in relation to research data management set by the funders of their research or by the terms of a research contract are adhered to. Adherence with Cardiff Met’s Open Access Policy.   
? Adherence with PREVENT where applicable.  

6.3 Cardiff Met expects that Deans of Schools (or the equivalent) will be responsible for:  

Ensuring that researchers in their School are aware of this policy and their responsibilities in relation to it. Developing local level guidance and procedures in relation to research data management in support of the principles and expectations of this policy and disseminating these to all research staff within their School.  

6.4 At institutional level, the University is responsible for:  

Providing access to services and facilities for the storage, backup, deposit and retention of research data and records in order to enable researchers to meet the requirements of this policy and those of the funders of their research. Providing researchers with access to training, support and advice in research data management.  

Providing the necessary resources to the central services responsible for the provision of these services, facilities and training.  

# 7. Implementation of this policy  

7.1 This policy will be underpinned by a timeline of phased implementation which will take into account different levels of priority and will manage expectations against cost.  The timeline will include a programme of awareness raising and staff development.  In recognition that there is much progress to be made, the policy will be reviewed on an annual basis, at least for the duration of the underpinning timeline.
