# Research Data Management Guideline  

With this guideline on Research Data Management (RDM), the data stewards at the Open Science Team in the University Library of Bern aim to support researchers from all faculties at the University of Bern and Insel Hospital in research data management throughout the project life cycle. This includes dealing with ethical data collection, data reuse, data generation and data processing, data documentation, and preparing data and metadata, as well as code, and software for publication.  

Research Data of high quality is an essential resource for science and society. Research Data Management (RDM) is a part of good scientific practice according to nationally and internationally recognized standards for scientific integrity. Good RDM enhances the robustness of research outputs, facilitates research collaborations, makes research results more reproducible, and strengthens society’s trust in science.  

## 1. Planning of Research Data Management  

The Data Management Plan (DMP) is a document and tool (Annex A, C, D), and guideline for researchers themselves to facilitate the implementation of good RDM practices in their projects throughout the whole project life cycle, including the reporting, as well as for planning the storage and safeguarding of data.  

The DMP stipulations issued by funding agencies must be strictly adhered to. The responsibility for this lies with the grantee(s).  

## 2. Data collection and processing  

Before data collection, data types should be identified. Sensitive (e.g., coded patient data or patient genomic data) and some non-sensitive data (e.g., animal data, plant tissues and / or seeds, soil etc.) all need authorized permissions, which must be obtained before data collection (Annex A, E).  

Data volume should be roughly estimated, considering raw, re-processed and analysed data may have a different data volume, therefore, more space for data storage may be needed. This should be considered before and during data collection.  

## 3. Data documentation and metadata  

The structure and the processing steps of all research data must be systemically documented in a digital, logical manner in order to ensure adherence to the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) principles1,2.  

The documentation includes general information like title of dataset; contributor information; date of data collection; geographic location of data collection; keywords describing the subject of the dataset; information about funding sources that supported the collection of the data; a codebook, lab journal and special software (Annex B).  

## 4. Data storage, security and backup  

Consult group / laboratory guidelines describing where raw, reprocessed, analysed, unpublished and published data and / or the corresponding protocols, surveys, paper data and samples are stored, as well as get in touch with the IT-Department of the University of Bern to ensure storage process and location (Annex A4).  

## 5. Ethical, legal and security issues  

Research projects conducted in Switzerland are subject to data protection law (cantonal data protection law, in some cases additionally the national data protection law) as well as special legal provisions on data protection under the Human Research Act (HRA) (Annex A2). The use of data in research projects within the scope of the HRA requires permission from the cantonal ethics commission Bern (CEC, Swissethics, Swissmedic) (Annex A8). The HRA's scope includes all methodled research on physical and mental illnesses in humans and on the structure and function of the human body, with the aim of gaining generalizable knowledge. The HRA's scope includes all methodled research on physical and mental illnesses in humans and on the structure and function of the human body, with the aim of gaining generalizable knowledge.  

Use of (coded) patient samples or data for research purposes is only permitted if written consent has been obtained (General or Informed Consent, respectively). The signed consent and a potential electronic Informed Consent (eIC) should be collected and stored separately from the coded sample/data, to avoid person identification.  

Research projects that do not fall within the scope of the HRA do not need permission from the cantonal ethics committee but are required to get legal authorization before an experiment can be conducted (e.g., animal studies). Depending on the project and institution, special provisions may apply for obtaining authorizations (Annex A8).  

According to the law (see Art. 70 Bern University Act, Annex A4; Art. 60 on the Law on Personnel (Personalgesetz; Annex A5), research results and outputs obtained at the University of Bern belong to the University. If data are obtained at different Universities, then joint ownership should be applied (see Unitectra, Annex A5). For clarification of details, please contact the legal services office at UniBE (Annex A2).  

## 6. Publication of Research Data, Programming Code and Software  

To follow the good scientific practice, research data should be published according to the principle “as open as possible, as closed as necessary”. Research data and programming code both are relevant and requested to be shared along with the publication under a “Research Data and Code Availability Statement”. They should be published and deposited in a FAIR research data repository along with rich metadata information (see section 3, Annex E4). If data cannot be openly published due to ethical or legal restrictions then a Data Transfer Agreement is recommended to upload along with the metadata and supplementary documentation material about the dataset, which will allow other researchers to understand and reuse the data (Annex A1,2 E).

## Annex D: Data Management Plan (DMP) tools  

DMPs can be written offline by using the downloaded template in a text document format. However, a number of web based DMP tools are currently available, containing DMP templates and providing guidance in interpreting and answering the questions.  

Some of the tools allow collaboration on a DMP, while tracking progress.  

### To consider:  

Check what DMP tool is recommended or provided by your funding agency. Check what DMP tool is recommended or provided by your institute. Make sure that the tool you choose includes the DMP template that you need. If you want to produce a machine-actionable DMP, you need to make sure the tool you choose allows exporting the DMP in a machine-actionable format (e.g., JSON) rather than only as a PDF document.
