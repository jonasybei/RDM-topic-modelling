## Research Data Management Policy  

The University is committed to supporting its researchers to ensure research data1 is well managed and to the continual improvement of that support.  

### Policy statements  

1.   The University is committed to research excellence and integrity. As such, it seeks to promote high standards of research data management throughout the research data lifecycle.   
2.   New research proposals from 9th September 2016 should include research data management plans or protocols in line with funders’ policies. In other instances, research data management plans are encouraged. All plans should include responsibilities for data collection, documentation and metadata, ethical and legal compliance, storage and backup, selection of data of long-term value, preservation and data sharing.   
3.   Research data management plans should ensure that research data are available for access and re-use wherever appropriate and under appropriate safeguards.   
4.   To enable research data to be discoverable and effectively re-used by others, sufficient metadata should be recorded and made openly available via the University data repository. The link to the repository can be found here: https://lboro.figshare.com/   
5.   All research data of continuing value to the researcher and the wider research community, or specified by funding bodies, or required for legal or other regulatory purposes should be registered with the University, even that which is retained elsewhere, for example in an international data service or domain repository.   
6.   Research data that may be of future historical interest, including data that substantiate research findings, should normally be offered and assessed for deposit and retention in an appropriate data service or domain repository, or the University data repository.   
7.   The legitimate interests of the subjects of research data must be protected.   
8.   Exclusive rights to reuse or publish research data should not be handed over to commercial publishers or agents without retaining the rights to make the data openly available for reuse, unless this is a condition of funding.   
9.   Where any research is subject to any associated contractual arrangements and/or grant conditions that conflict with this policy, the provisions of such contractual arrangements and/or grant conditions will take precedence.  

#### Researchers’ responsibilities  

Responsibility for the creation of a research data management plan, the updating of that plan (where necessary), and the implementation of that plan throughout the research lifecycle during any research project or programme lies with Principal Investigators (PIs). Heads of Departments and Centres and others responsible for research staff and students should ensure that researchers in their areas are aware of the University’s policy regarding research data management and its associated guidelines and procedures.  

Researchers are required to comply with the conditions of their of their research funders’ data policies.   
Researchers should ensure published results always include information on how to access the supporting data.   
PIs should review their data holdings assessing their research value e.g. for potential future use in research and education, and wider applications for policy, commerce or public interests.   
PIs should notify the University of their data holdings and supply the Data Asset Register (currently the University data repository) with metadata relating to their data.  

### University’s responsibilities  

The University will provide access to training, support, advice and, where appropriate, guidelines and templates for research data management and research data management plans.   
The University will provide access to mechanisms and services for storage, backup, registration, valuation, deposit and retention of research data assets in support of current and future access, during and after completion of research projects.   
The University reserves the right to appraise and review its data holdings in consultation with PIs and appropriate experts.   
This policy will be reviewed and updated through the Research Committee in consultation with appropriate stakeholders.  

### Relationship with existing policies  

Research data will be managed in accordance with the University’s other policies and guidelines, such as:
