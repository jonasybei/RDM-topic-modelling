# Introduction  

1 The principles of open science and engagement are central to Teesside University’s Research Strategy (2020-2025) and the University’s mission to generate and apply knowledge that contributes to the economic, social and cultural success of students, partners and the communities we serve.  

.2 The University recognises the importance of good data management in assuring the integrity of its research and in supporting approaches to open science. It supports the principles of the Concordat on Open Research Data1 which state that ‘research data should, wherever possible be made openly available for use by others in a manner consistent with relevant legal, ethical, disciplinary and regulatory frameworks and norms’.  

.3 To embed good practice in research and ensure research data are easily accessible, the University has developed this Research Data Management Policy in accordance with The Concordat on Open Research Data, Funder requirements, and best practice for research data management as set out in the LEARN2 Toolkit.  

1.4 The University’s position on related issues is set out in its policies for Open Access, Data Protection, Research Ethics, Freedom of Information and Information Security.  

This policy applies to all staff and students involved in the creation, collection and curation of research data at Teesside University; and all data generated or processed as part of research for which the University is responsible.  

Research is any creative and systematically performed work with the goal of furthering knowledge, including discoveries regarding people, culture and society, in addition to the use of such knowledge for new applications.  

.2 Researchers refers to all research-active members of an institution including employees and doctoral candidates. Persons not directly affiliated with an institution, but who, for purposes of research, make use of or are physically present at the institution, are also included in the term. Visiting researchers or collaborators may also be expected to comply with the policy.  

3.3 Research data refers to all information (independent of form or presentation) needed to support or validate the development, results, observations or findings of a research project, including contextual information. Research data include all materials which are created in the course of academic work, including digitisation, records, source research, experiments, measurements, surveys and interviews. This includes software and code. Research data can take on several forms during the lifespan of a research project. Data can exist as gradations of raw data, processed data (including negative and inconclusive results), published data and Open Access published data, and with varying levels of access, including open data, restricted data and closed data.  

# Planning  

All new research projects should include a research data management plan (DMP) which details approaches to the capture, management, integrity, confidentiality, retention, ownership, sharing and publication of research data. Compliance with relevant legal and ethical frameworks and funder requirements where relevant should be ensured.  A DMP must be developed where specified by a funder, sponsor or other relevant stakeholder, and is strongly encouraged as best practice for all projects.  

The University provides access to an online tool3 which can be used to create Data Management Plans if another tool, such as one provided by a funder, is not being used.  

# 5 Storage and Management  

Research data should be stored and made available for use in a suitable repository or archiving system and provided with persistent identifiers. Research data should be stored on the University’s research data repository4, or a record should be created in the repository with a link to a suitable external repository, for example if it is felt that an external discipline-specific policy would give a dataset enhanced visibility or when the use of an external repository is required by an external funder.  

.2 It is important to preserve the integrity of research data and they must be stored in a correct reliable manner. Data storage should follow FAIR data principles5 and must be identifiable, accessible, traceable, interoperable, and whenever possible, available for subsequent use.  

Non-digital research data should be stored in a form that would allow for sharing and access if required. The fact that research data is non-digital does not provide a sufficient reason for restricting access.  

Research data must be assigned a licence for open use, in compliance with intellectual property rights, if no third-party rights, legal requirements or property laws prohibit it.  

# 6 6.1  

# Retention  

Research data and records are to be stored and made available in accordance with the research data management plan, relevant  

intellectual property laws, and/or the requirements of third-party funders, within the parameters of applicable legal or contractual requirements.  

.2 The minimum archive duration for research data and records should be determined by best practice, discipline norms and stakeholder requirements where relevant.  In the absence of these, a general guideline is that data should be retained for 10 years after either the assignment of a persistent identifier or publication of related research results, whichever is later.  

# Disposal  

Research data should be disposed of securely, in accordance with the DMP and the University’s Information Security Policy.  The timing of data disposal should reflect any ethical, contractual and legal requirements, and current best practice.  

Responsibilities, rights and duties  

8.1 Researchers are responsible for:  

The development of the DMP.  Support is available from the   
Library and Research and Enterprise Office.   
Management of research data and data sets in conjunction with the principles and requirements expressed in this policy.   
Planning for the curation and management of research data and related records, as reflected in the DMP   
Compliance with the requirements of research funders;   
requirements for specific projects should be described in the DMP. When applying for funding, researchers must ensure that   
adequate resources to cover the costs associated with data   
management are requested where possible.   
The most senior researcher associated with a research project (funded or unfunded) is the Data Lead and is ultimately responsible for research data management associated with the project.   
o For funded projects this will be the Principal Investigator o For PGR students this will the Director of Studies.   
The Data Lead must ensure that all researchers working on the project are aware of the requirements of this policy.   
If a researcher leaves the University, they should inform the Data Lead of any data they hold relating to a research project and arrange for the data to be made available to the Data Lead.  If the Data Lead leaves the University, they should discuss the research data they hold with their line manager or Associate Dean (Research and Innovation) and ensure that appropriate decisions are taken on  

the management of the research data.  This may include ensuring that funder requirements are met.  

8.2 Teesside University is responsible for:  

Developing and providing mechanisms, services and infrastructure for the registration, storage, curation, and deposit of research data. • Supporting the drafting, costing and provision of DMPs Raising awareness of and providing support in meeting the principles set out in the policy.
