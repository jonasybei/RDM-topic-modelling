This policy defines the responsibilities at individual and institutional level which should guide the work of those involved in data collection, processing, storage, maintenance, and archival.  

1. Research data will be managed to the highest standards throughout the research data lifecycle as part of the University’s commitment to research excellence.   
2. Responsibility for research data management during any research project or programme lies primarily with Principal Investigators (PIs).   
3. All new research proposals must include a Data Management Plan (DMP) that explicitly addresses data capture, management, storage, integrity, associated costs, confidentiality, retention, sharing, and publication.  

4. The legitimate interests of any human participants of research must be protected.  

5. Research data and records should be:  

Accurate, documented, complete, authentic, and reliable   
• Stored in a safe and secure manner   
• Stored in a manner which is compliant with legal obligations and, where applicable, the requirements of funding bodies and project-specific protocols approved by the University’s Research Ethics Panel   
• Able to be made available to others in line with appropriate ethical, data sharing, and open access principles Data which is shared openly should follow FAIR principles; Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reuseable   
6. Research data and any associated records should be retained for as long as they are of continuing value to the researcher and the wider research community, and as long as specified by the research funder, patent law, legislative, or other regulatory requirements. The minimum retention period for research data is three (3) years after publication or public release of the research. In many instances, researchers or the university will resolve to retain research data for a period surpassing the minimum requirement or indefinitely.   
7. Published research papers should include a short statement describing how any supporting research data may be accessed, e.g. though citation and the use of a DOI link.   
8. Subject to third party interests, research data which supports a scholarly work produced by a member of University staff, shall be owned by the University and retained for an appropriate period of time in accordance with point 6.

12. The University will provide training, support, advice, and where appropriate, guidelines and templates for research data management and data management plans.   
13. Exclusive (and non-exclusive) rights to publish research data should not be handed over for commercial purposes free of charge.
