# Position Statement  

The University of South Wales acknowledges and endorses the Research Council UK’s Common Principles on Data Policy statement that publicly funded research data are a public good, produced in the public interest, which should be made openly available with as few restrictions as possible in a timely and responsible manner that does not harm intellectual property.  For the purpose of this policy, the term “research data” is clarified as information gathered through the pursuit of research activity. Such information may be in a variety of forms including quantitative data, interview recordings or transcripts, video or audio recordings.  

Research data management is of strategic importance to the university. The university provides an effective, safe and sustainable working environment, has developed appropriate policies and approaches based on current research lifecycle processes and expected best practice. Good research data management is important for securing research funding and we are keen to minimise risks associated with poor research data management.  

# Coverage  

The following policy on Research Data Management applies to all research active staff and students. It needs to be acknowledged that this is an aspirational policy, and that implementation will take time. As a result the university will endeavour to manage research data to the highest standard throughout the research data lifecycle as part of the University’s commitment to research excellence.  

# Institutional Responsibility  

The University will work to provide mechanisms where no appropriate subject or publisher repository exists for the storage, backup, registration, deposit and retention of research data assets in support of current and future access, during and after completion of research projects.  

The University will work to provide training, support, advice and, where appropriate guidelines and templates for the research data management and research data management plans.  

# Researcher Responsibility  

Direct responsibility for future research data management lies primarily with Principal Investigators who must ensure that data that has not been generated in a digital format is converted and stored in a timely manner.  

# Data Management/Sharing Plans  

• All new research funding proposals must include research data management/ sharing plans that clearly address data capture, management, integrity, confidentiality and intellectual property, retention, sharing and publication.  

• If any 3rd party data has been used, you must consider whether copyright clearance is necessary. You should ensure that you have obtained permission from the rights holder in writing before sharing or developing further data.  

• Personal data must be processed in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998. The legitimate interests of the subjects of research data must be protected in line with the appropriate USW policy.  

• Research data management/sharing plans must ensure that research data are available for access and re-use where appropriate and under appropriate safeguards. Researchers are encouraged to create data in an appropriate digital format wherever possible, in order to facilitate data re-use (open-by-default).  

Any data which is retained elsewhere, for example in an international data service or repository should be registered with the University of South Wales, along with the appropriate metadata.  

• Research data that represent records of the University, including data that substantiate research findings, should be offered for deposit and retention in an appropriate national or international data service or repository where possible.  

• Exclusive rights to reuse or publish research data should not be handed over to commercial publishers or agents without retaining the rights to make the data openly available for reuse, unless this is a condition of funding.
