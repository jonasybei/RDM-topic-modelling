# 1. Background  

1.1. Topic Policy on the management of research data.  

# 1.2. Description  

An important ambition of UMC Utrecht is 'Open Science ' for better health care and social involvement.  This is about 'open access' (free access to scientific publications), 'open data' and reuse of scientific data, making science more efficient, more widely applicable and reproducible. Data is the foundation of scientific research. Throughout the research cycle, the quality and durability of data must therefore be ensured through careful management. If the quality and durability of data is not in order, the research is not reproducible. Making the data ‘open’ and reusable is not considered.  Research Data Management (RDM) deals with the collection, documentation, processing, storage, sustainable archiving and reusability of the research data. Funders and publishers also take part in above ambition and ask for a data management plan, wherein the researcher demonstrates that the data to be collected, will be available for reuse in the future.  

The policy is based on the following documents:  

• The Research Code of UMC Utrecht   
• Privacy Regulations of UMC Utrecht The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the General Data Protection Regulation Implementation Act The Handbook for Adequate Natural Datastewardship (HANDS), prepared by the Dutch Federation of University medical centers (NFU).  

# 1.3. Target audience  

All employees involved in scientific research must read and comply with this policy, in particular: department heads, managers research, researchers, quality coordinators, policy advisors, data managers, research coordinators and research nurses .  

# 1.4. Application area  

The scope of this policy document is the data management of all scientific research, which is carried out under the responsibility of UMC Utrecht. This also concerns multicenter research in which an external party bears the main responsibility, and the UMC Utrecht collects data as a participating center.  

# 1.5. Roles and Responsibilities  

The roles and responsibilities are described in the Research Data Governance Model.  

# 1.6. Aim  

Establishing this policy must guide all involved parties in the adequate design and implementation of Research Data Management.  

# 2. Principles  

1. FAIR data  

For all scientific output we strive for the highest possible degree of 'Fairness', where FAIR stands for:  

Findable: datasets are findable, provided with a persistent identifier and sufficient metadata , with which specific datasets can be found;   
Accessible: datasets are accessible, either at data level or at metadata level, and clear user conditions have been drawn up;   
Interoperable: datasets are interchangeable and standard terminologies and vocabularies are used wherever possible;   
Reusable: datasets are reusable, meet the above criteria and are sufficiently described, so that reuse is scientifically and ethically sound.  

# 2. Privacy by Default/ Privacy by Design  

The use of personal data for research is based on:  

A. Privacy by Default : the chosen standard method maximally guarantees the privacy of the data subject (such as use of standard research folder design). The Privacy by Default idea is built into the technology of, for example, data collection and other work processes.   
B. Privacy by Design: consider privacy when designing the study (such as minimizing the amount of personal data and pseudonymising as soon as possible).  

# 3. Dataminimization  

Not only in the context of privacy laws, but also in the context of efficiency and scientific integrity, the collection of research data (and in particular of personal data) needs to be demonstrably legitimate, fit for the purpose of the study, and contain no irrelevant data. However, some research requires a broader collection of data (for example to find accidental discoveries in a certain clinical picture in cohort studies). This is described in the Data Management Plan.  

# 4. Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)  

A DPIA4 ensures that the impact of the intended project on the privacy of those involved and the risks for those involved and for the organization is considered before the start of the project. For processing of health information that is directly or indirectly traceable to the person (sensitive personal data), we assume that the outcome of a DPIA will be 'high risk' . Therefore, for each study it is described which measures will be taken to minimize the impact on the privacy of the study participants. This is described in the Data Management Plan.  

# 5. Research Data in control  

In line with the general standards of the Netherlands Code of Conduct for Research Integrity 2018 it is ensured that data sources are verifiable, that there is an honest and transparent description of the data collection, that both raw and final data are carefully stored and that the data are as FAIR as possible.  It is also ensured that all data and research materials are collected with the appropriate infrastructure, that they are archived in a sustainable manner and are as ‘open’ as possible and as ‘closed’ (confidential) as necessary.  

# 6. Data Sharing Statement  

In the context of Open Science, the sharing of scientific data with other researchers is encouraged.  A data sharing statement is a statement about which research data will be shared after completion of the research, how the data will be made available and under which conditions this will be done.  The data sharing statement provides a good description of why data can or cannot be shared and is therefore a compulsory part of the Data Management Plan for all scientific research. This requires compliance with laws and regulations in the field of privacy. This is based on the principle "As open as possible, as closed as necessary".  

# 7. Researchers access to data expertise  

Like other Dutch UMCs, UMC Utrecht follows the NFU Guidelines for data stewardship. We view data as legitimate and citable products of research, and are transparent about how the data can be viewed or used6. The support of researchers by data management experts is organized differently per division.  In the coming year, data stewardship will be formalized, as described by NFU Data4lifesciences, to provide a more policyoriented approach to data management within the Divisions.  

# 3. Implementation framework  

3.1. Preparation of the research  

# 3.1.1. Data Management Plan (DMP)  

In the context of integrity and transparency of research and FAIR data for Open Science, UMC Utrecht researchers are required to fill in a DMP for scientific research using the UMC Utrecht specific DMP template, unless a funder has a mandatory template . The UMC Utrecht DMP template supports researchers with examples of answers, and with information about the specific subjects.  Data managers can be consulted if necessary.  With this , the UMC Utrecht aims for transparency in data management processes and compliance with legislation and regulations. The content of the DMP is in line with national and international initiatives9.  

# 3.1.2. Storage and organization of files  

For research purposes, UMC Utrecht offers the Research Folder Structure. Separate storage of personal data and research data is possible here. The storage location is recorded in the Data Management Plan. The storage location is under management at UMC Utrecht unless otherwise stated in the Data Management Plan. The principal investigator is responsible for the proper management of the research folders. The organization and access to folders is carried out by an authorized employee on behalf of the principal investigator.  

6 Research Code UMC Utrecht   
7 For all types of scientific research, inclusive all non WMO compliant research   
8 National and international development is that scientific institutions take responsiblility of the DMP content, instead of funders with a   
number of required items, as is described in   
9  ERC Information for ERC grantees  

# 3.2. Data Collection  

# 3.2.1. Collecting data  

For the collection of data for research, automated data collection is used as much as possible, using the available infrastructure of the UMC Utrecht.  For choosing the most suitable data collection system, a decision aid is available and the Data Manager can be consulted.  When personal data must be processed in software hosted by an external party, a processor agreement with the software provider is needed.  Audit trails, as used for years in Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP guideline), are mandatory for all scientific research.  

# 3.2.2. Registration of research participation  

In view of patient safety, it is important that every participation in scientific research is registered in the electronic patient database (EPD). This also applies to healthy volunteers. In case, for valid reasons, it is not desirable to register healthy subjects in the EPD, one can deviate from registration in the EPD ( see SOP Performing WMO-study). This must be documented in the DMP.  

# 3.2.3. Re-use of data  

Re-use of healthcare data (retrospective studies) is possible after pseudonymization of the data (see also 3.3.2). Data that are collected in healthcare, are made available for research in the Research Data Platform (RDP). For specific expertise and guided searches in sources one can use the Utrecht Patient Oriented Database (UPOD). Making data available for reuse must always comply with applicable laws and regulations. For the use of external data sources for research, researchers turn to the supplier of the data and jointly draw up a Data Access Agreement. Often this is based on documents from the supplier.  

# 3.2.4. Raw data storage  

Collected data, whether this has been done via re-use or via new data collection,  needs to be stored and frozen (read only) as 'raw data' immediately after collection. Raw data are not to be edited or changed. This is necessary, so that, at any time, one can trace back to the original data.  

# 3.3. Data preparation  

# 3.3.1. Validation  

All adaptations for validation and preparation of a suitable dataset for analysis are documented in such a way that the research results are verifiable. For all scientific research it is mandatory to keep an audit trail. When the raw data consists of care data which are erroneously recorded in the electronic patient files (EPD), the usual care processes are followed to adjust that information.  This means that only the care provider can change this data, and not the researcher.  

# 3.3.2. Anonymize/Pseudonymize  

Directly identifying personal data must be stored separately from the research data, and research data must be anonymised or pseudonymised. Care data are almost always indirectly traceable to the person and completely anonymizing will therefore often not be possible.  A pseudonymised file can indirectly be traced back to a natural person, as long as a key file exists. An important reason to still pseudonymise data is that this removes the direct traceability to a person. Technical facilities (such as the RDP and the Research Folder Structure) and procedural provisions ensure that the researcher does not have access to the directly identifying data.  In case of indirect traceability to a person in research files, appropriate measures are taken to remove the indirect traceability to an individual when publishing or sharing data10.  

# 3.3.3. Storage of analysis file  

After validation and preparation, and before final analysis and reporting, the analysis file is to be frozen. The analysis file is pseudonymised, or anonymized. For separate storage of personal data and research data, the Research Folder Structure can be used.  In a frozen data collection it is no longer allowed to change or add data. Statistical analyses are only performed on the frozen datasets.  

# 3.3.4. Requirements for data storage  

For all types of research, the storage location is physically and digitally protected. The policy of UMC Utrecht regarding information security is described in the Information Security Directive. UMC Utrecht provides a number of storage locations that meet these requirements, such as bulk storage and departmental disks.  The DMP must describe where the data is stored, so that it is clear for every employee in the research team, where the data can be found.  

# 3.3.5. Data exchange during a study  

Exchanging data with internal colleagues and external partners during a study, is done in a safe manner according to the regulations of the UMC Utrecht, which can be found under this link. Prior to the exchange  

and sharing of data with external parties, a Data Transfer Agreement has been drawn up, which establishes the conditions under which data are shared.  

# 3.4. Metadata and Documentation  

Metadata provide the information needed to enable a broad scientific community to find, share and understand the content and context of a dataset.  When compiling metadata, standardization is sought as much as possible.  With the mandatory DMP, UMC Utrecht supports researchers in the implementation of good metadata of research data, which is a prerequisite for FAIR data.  

# 3.5. Data Analysis  

The scripts for data analysis are saved and commented (thus creating an audit trail), so that, when the script is read by an experienced colleague researcher/statistician/data analyst, it is completely clear why the steps in the analysis have been taken and which choices have been made.  

# 3.6. Data Archiving  

# 3.6.1. Transfer of custody after completion  

When a principal investigator leaves after completion of the research, the management of the research folder and all data must be transferred to the new responsible person or to the department head.  Data collected for scientific research, in which UMC Utrecht is end responsible or performs part of the research, are stored in storage locations managed by UMC Utrecht, unless other contractual agreements have been made about this.  

10 Suitable measures, e.g. aggregation of data (use of birth year in stead of birth date) or minimization of data in light of ‘the more variables you combine, the higher the risk of indirect identification’.  

# 3.6.2. Documentation and Publication  

To ensure that all relevant data remain accessible, detailed agreements must be made prior to the start of the study, about all relevant data and the format in which they will be made available or transferred after the study has ended (see also ICH-GCP 4.9. 0, 4.9.4 and 4.9.5.). In order to archive the research data, a data package is created, consisting of data, metadata and documentation.  Which specific metadata and documents are archived, depends on the type of research. The data package contains all information for the research to be replicated. The Data Management Plan and the Division Datamanager offer support in the selection of files in a data package.  

# 3.6.3. Storage period  

Concerning the retention period, there are different legal standards for different types of research: this is at least 15 years for research with humans (Basic Selection Document), unless otherwise contracted. Anonymous datasets receive, with applicable conditions, an infinite storage period by depositing the sets in a dedicated archive (see Data Archiving), so that the data is available for future scientific research.  

# 3.6.4. Data Archiving  

Data storage and data archiving is not the same. Data can be stored safely, but this does not mean that data will be findable and accessible in the future. Data archiving, on the other hand, is about the sustainable accessibility of the research data, where the data are provided with metadata, documentation and a persistent identifier. Subsequently, it is decided where the data and/or metadata will be archived for sustainable accessibility.  This does not necessarily mean that the data is available to everyone, see Data Sharing. Global accessible data archives include: DANS, 4TUdatacentrum, SURFSARA, CLARIN (NWO), EMBLEBI.  

# 3.7. Data Sharing  

# 3.7.1. Accessibility  

In addition to open access to publications, accessibility of the underlying research data is stimulated, within the framework of the privacy legislation, the control rights of the study participants and the contractual agreements with third parties and funders.  For each separate study, the data access policy will have to be determined and described in the Data Sharing Statement (one of the principles of Research Data Management). Agreements about sharing data with a specific third party (both during the research and after publishing the research results) are contractually written in a Data Transfer Agreement.  

# 3.7.2. Trusted Third Party (TTP)  

For linking research data and data from external parties at patient level, a TTP is used, or, if possible, similar technological or procedural solutions within the UMC Utrecht.
