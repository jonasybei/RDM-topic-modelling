# ICBM Research Data Management Policy  

# Background & Motivation  

Data, records, and sample related information are fundamental to both high quality research and academic integrity: to verify and defend the process and outcomes of research, accurate and retrievable research data are essential. Increasing amounts of collected and produced raw data, as well as processed data, need to be retained in order to exploit their long-term value for research, teaching, and for wider exploitation for the public good.  

The purpose of data management is to maximise the academic value of research data by ensuring that such data is managed according to good practices for collection, curation, storage, management, retrieval, re-use, sharing, archiving, and access, appropriate for the data and discipline concerned.  

# Objectives  

This policy defines research data as all data, records, and sample related information created or collected for the purposes of analysis to generate original research results. In accordance with the university guidelines for good scientific practice[1] and the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and thus Reusable (FAIR) principles[2], research data, regardless of the form or the media in which they may exist, should be  

accurate, complete, authentic, and reliable, • identifiable, retrievable, and available when needed, secure and safe, able to be made available to others.  

Research data should be retained  

a) as long as they are of continuing value to the researcher or the wider research community, b) as long as specified by the funding body, and c) for a minimum of ten years after publication.  

# Responsibilities of Researchers  

• Research data should be managed in accordance with the above principles and requirements. The principal investigator of a project is responsible for the data life-cycle. • Clear procedures for the collection, storage, use, re-use, access and retention of the research data should be developed and documented. This information should be incorporated, where appropriate, in a research data management plan (DMP). Such DMP should describe how the collection of data and metadata will be integrated into everyday research processes, so as to make compliance with the DMP as simple as possible. • Researchers should plan the ongoing storage of their research data after the completion of the research as to how and where such data will be stored. Appropriate long-term archives include national or international subject-specific archives or a managed university repository.  

• Requirements concerning research data on the part of funding bodies must be met. This includes compliance with publication-ban, -restrictions, or -duty imposed by external contracting bodies, administrative regulations, and federal laws.  

# Responsibilities of the ICBM  

• The ICBM provides researchers with access to training, support, and advice on data management.   
• The ICBM provides access to services and facilities for the storage, backup, and deposit of research data.   
• The ICBM will build and maintain a central catalogue of metadata descriptions for indexing, archiving, naming, and retrieval of datasets.  

Acknowledging that this is an aspirational policy, the ICBM intends that an evolutionary approach will be taken to fully implement this policy and related initiatives over a number of years. To this end, the ICBM establishes a data management team, which will organise, develop, and implement all necessary measures to fulfil the obligations of the ICBM.
