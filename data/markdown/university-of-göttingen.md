Preamble  

The Georg-August-University Goettingen is committed to diligently preserve results of scholarship, to produce novel results through research, and to make results accessible and reusable for academia and the wider society, now and for future generations. The management, protection, preservation and sustainable provision of research data must therefore be carried out in accordance with recognized standards, meet high expectations and fulfil legal and ethical obligations. The University acknowledges that the implementation of this guideline will depend on the settings and requirements of each subject area.

2. Research data are those data collected, observed, simulated, derived, or generated during the course of research.   
3. Management of research data includes their planning, collection, processing, and preservation. It ensures the access to, and the reuse, reproducibility, and quality assurance of all research data underpinning research results.   
4. Research data management is generally the responsibility of the person leading a project and the researcher who is acting in an individual capacity. A particular responsibility is the adherence to good practices of research as well as standards in their subject area.

9. The University and its researchers adhere in their research data management to given conditions of ethics, data protection, intellectual property, privacy and disclosure. This leaves regulations untouched that relate to an assessment of research data according to the German employee invention act and specific contractual agreements.   
10. If exploitation or publication rights of data were transferred to third parties, it should be a precondition that research data remain openly and freely available for research purposes.
