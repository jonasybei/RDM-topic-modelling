### 1. INTRODUCTION  

Research excellence depends on accurate and reliable research data. This is a key output and asset of the University that should be created and managed in line with best practice. Many funders now require Data Management Plans as part of the funding proposal and the University also recognises that publicly funded research is a public good and should be discoverable and made available to allow re-use.  

### 2. PURPOSE  

The purpose of this policy is to ensure that research data created and used within the University is managed and curated to the appropriate professional standards throughout its lifecycle, and can be made available for re-use where appropriate.  

The University will support and enable its researchers to comply with these requirements through the provision of infrastructure, training, advice and assistance.

3.3 Researchers shall create a Data Management Plan in accordance with the guidelines of the Funders.  

3.4 A register of all Research Data deposited in any repository should be maintained
