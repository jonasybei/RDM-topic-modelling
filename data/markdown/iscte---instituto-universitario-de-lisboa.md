### Introduction  

### Brief context  

The policy proposed in this document aims to be in line with the various initiatives that have been published by the European Commission, namely the Recommendation of 2012 on access to and preservation of scientific information and its update in 2018.  

This document also took into account the Horizon 2020 guidelines on rules of open access to scientific publications; Regulation (EU) 2021/695 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing Horizon Europe – the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation, laying down its rules for participation and dissemination, and Council Decision (EU) 2021/764 establishing the specific programme implementing Horizon Europe – the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation.  

It also takes into consideration important developments at a European level related to Open Science and Open Access, such as the EU Council Conclusions of 2016 on the transition towards an Open Science system, the ‘Plan S’ and ‘cOAlition S’, the developments of the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) and in particular the Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda, the action lines of the EU Open Science Policy, the Resolution on “A new ERA for Research and Innovation” and EU Directive 2019 on open data and the reuse of public-sector information and the Report "Towards a 2030 Vision on the Future of Universities in Europe”.  

Finally, it considers other relevant reports such as: “Perspectives on the new European Research Area from the university sector”, “Universities without walls: A vision for 2030” of the  European University Association, “Looking to the Future: the Guild’s Vision for Europe’s Universities” of The Guild of European Research-Intensive Universities, and Science Europe’s practical guide “International Alignment of Research Data Management.”  

### Benefits and advantages of Open Science  

Open Science is a scientific activity conducted in an open, collaborative and transparent manner, in all fields of knowledge, from the basic sciences to the social sciences and humanities.2,3 It has the potential to increase the quality and efficiency of research and fast-track the advancement of knowledge and innovation through the sharing of results, making them more reusable and improving their reproducibility. It is based on the following principles:  

transparency in practices, methodology, observation and data collection;   
the provision, public access, reuse and replicability of research results and methods;   
transparency in scientific communication;   
the use of web-based tools to facilitate scientific collaboration.

## Glossary  

Research data  

Quantitative information or qualitative statements collected by researchers during their work, through experimentation, observation, modelling, interview, or other methods.  

The data can be classified as:  

“raw” or primary (for example, directly derived from measurement or collection); derived from primary data for subsequent analysis or interpretation (for example, revised data or as an extract of a larger dataset); derived from existing sources where the rights may be held by others.  

Research data management  

Describes the organisation, storage, preservation and sharing of data collected and used in a research project. This involves the daily management of research data over the lifetime of a research project. It also covers decisions about how the data will be preserved and shared after the project’s completion (for example, on depositing the data in a repository for long-term preservation and access).  

### Principal investigator  

Researcher responsible for a given research, group, or team leader, who is supervising a research project.  

Metadata  

Information that describes significant aspects of a dataset. Some examples include: authors, title, publication date, unique identifier, a description of the content of the dataset and license. Metadata provide other researchers with the necessary information to understand and reuse the dataset, and to make the dataset more accessible and findable.  

### Data management plan (DMP)  

Plan that describes how the research data will be managed, during their life cycle. This plan covers various areas, from the strategy for data collection, backup and storage, ethical/legal requirements related to the data, sharing and preservation of data.  

FAIR principles  

Series of guiding principles to ensure that the data is findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. FORCE1114 is the organisation that defined these principles and provides an explanation on their exact meaning and implementation.  

Data repository  

Corresponds to platforms that enable aggregating, storing, preserving, and managing research datasets. The depositing of data in repositories for this purpose increases their visibility and the opportunities of collaboration within the scientific community. In being stored, preserved and made accessible, the research data can contribute to the reproducibility and dissemination of science, and to their validation.
