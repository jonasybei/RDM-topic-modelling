# SOAS Research Data Management Policy  

SOAS recognizes the importance of good research data management especially in light of the increased emphasis and requirements being placed on the sharing and therefore the potential re-use of research data  by  key  funders  of  SOAS  research.  We  will  develop  research  data  management  practices  in  line with  best  practice,  RCUK  Common  Principles  on  Data  Policy  and  HEFCE’s  Concordat  on  Open  Data . SOAS  adopts  the  following  policy  on  research  data  management  to  set  out  the  responsibilities  of  the university and its staff in managing and preserving its research data. It is acknowledged that this is an aspirational policy, and that it will need regular review.  

1. This policy applies to all research conducted by SOAS staff and postgraduate research students regardless of whether the research is externally funded. The policy does not currently apply to postgraduate research students, taught postgraduate students or undergraduates.   
2. In implementing the policy SOAS will first and foremost prioritize funder compliance in research data management for externally funded projects and best practice in data security for all research data. .   
3. Where no external contract exists, the University normally has ownership of primary data generated in the course of research undertaken by researchers in its employment. Postgraduate research students retain ownership of the data collected during their research.   
4. This policy supports the principle that researchers should have privileged access to, and exclusive use of, data collected in the course of a research project prior to these data being published (made openly accessible). However this principle is subject to contractual, ethical, legal and/or commercial considerations.  

# Researcher Responsibilities  

5. Researchers should ensure that exclusive Rights to reuse or publishing of research data must not be handed over to commercial publishers or agents without retaining the rights to make the data openly available for re-use, unless this is a condition of funding.   
6. Where research is conducted in collaboration with external partners, the lead researcher at SOAS must ensure that suitable agreements for the ownership and use of research data are established and set out in writing before the start of the project.   
7. The legitimate interests of the research participants must be considered at all times, in line with the University's guidance on ‘Using Personal Data in Research’  and the ‘SOAS Resea   
8. rch Ethics Policy’ .   
9. Research data should be managed in accordance with School and sector guidance on research data management throughout the research data lifecycle as part of the University's commitment to research excellence.   
10. Responsibility for research data management planning and research data management for a research project lies with the lead researcher at SOAS for the duration of a research project. In practice the day-to-day management of research data may be shared with other researchers involved in a project.   
11. Researchers should seek support at the earliest stages of planning a research project, to effectively plan research data management activities and any costs involved.   
12. Researchers must take into account and plan for any likely costs for storing and managing their research data during the lifetime of a project to ensure that the costs associated with research data management are, as far as possible, included in budgets for research projects.   
13. All new research applications for external and internal funding, which anticipate significant generation of research data, must include a research data management plan for which support and guidance can be provided.   
14. Researchers must ensure research data is stored with appropriate security from the start of research data capture.   
15. It is expected that research data will be made available for access and reuse, in the most cost-effective way and according to any funder requirements via a SOAS, national or subject repository and with appropriate safeguards. If this is not possible procedures must be considered which would allow facilitated access to data for approved researchers and a process put in place for requests for access to research to data.   
16. All publications that report publicly-funded research results must include a brief statement describing how the underpinning data can be accessed, and the terms on which access may be granted.  

# The University's Responsibilities  

17. SOAS will develop guidance and training materials to support researchers in best practice for general research data management activities and relating to the specific requirements of key SOAS research funders.   
18. A costing methodology will be further developed to support researchers in fully costing research data management activities into their funding applications and budgets.   
19. Advice will be provided for checking and developing research data management plans submitted in funding applications. Researchers whose funders do not have a specific data management plan or guidance will be supported in writing a general data management plan which must be in place before research commences.   
20. Advice and guidance will be provided for active research projects, prioritising support for researchers in securing their data.   
21. Advice will be given on the most appropriate and cost effective location for the long-term deposit of SOAS research datasets that researchers are required to or wish to share.  Guidance will be provided to researchers on preparation of appropriate metadata and documentation and assigning  a persistent URL to encourage discovery and citation of shared SOAS research datasets.   
22. The Institutional Repository (SOAS Research Online) will serve as a register for research data sets retained at SOAS (on a repository or server) or elsewhere (e.g. a national data service or subject repository).   
23. SOAS will monitor the development of and opportunities for participation in any shared research data management services e.g. the current JISC Shared RDM Service project.   
24. Where projects have been developed in full accordance with this policy, SOAS will support the preservation and access to research data generated by projects funded by the RCUK beyond the duration of research projects and for at least 10 years.   
25. SOAS will seek opportunities to embed awareness of and good practice relating to research data management in existing School structures.   
26. Researchers can access support for research data management through a dedicated email researchdata@soas.ac.uk through which approriate support and advice will be coordinated.
