# RESEARCHDATAMANAGEMENT  

1. Purpose and Context  

RGU recognises that good research is underpinned and validated by good data. Research data provides the evidence of academic endeavours and in conjunction with publications, forms an important part of the scholarly record. Research data is a valuable asset and good management of research data brings benefits to the researcher, the University and the wider community. Allresearchers at RGU create or use some type of data as part the research process.  

12  Responsible handling of research data provides α clear indication that the institution and individual researchers are operating with integrity.  

1.3  Sharing research data appropriately enhances the value and impact of research; therefore, RGU supports:  

1.3.1   the UKRl position that publicly funded research data is a public good and that it should be made openly available with as few restrictions as possible in a timely and responsible manner  

1.3.1.1 “Publicly funded" includes any research undertaken whilst employed or studying at RGU, including where studies are self-funded. Specific contractual arrangements relating to research funded by a commercial interest may be put in place on a case by case basis  

1.4   RGU advocates an open access approach to research data wherever possible. However, open access needs to be balanced with the constraints of security, confidentiality and commercial interest.  

This policy provides detailed information to supplement the RGU Research Governance and Integrity policy. Safe and ethical handling of data is a fundamental part of good practice for research, demonstrating; honesty, rigour, transparency and open communication, care and respect. The RGU Information Governance Policy also provides context, with explicit explanation of the legislative environment governing the handling of any personal data.  

2. Legislation and Standards  

2.1 Researchers are responsible for making themselves familiar with and adhering to legislation, ethical standards, (in particular NHS Ethics Committee requirements & Caldicott), regulatory requirements and contractual obligations including funder policies that pertain to their research.  

2.2  Key legislation includes; the Data Protection Act (2018) and General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) (2018), the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act (2002), Intellectual Property Rights (2014), and Copyright (1988).  

2.3 The UK government promotes open research data as part of all the research it funds including research commissioned with industry and HEl partners.  

3. Concordat on Open Research Data  

In keeping with the principles outlined in the Concordat on Open Research Data RGU aims to demonstrate that the research community;  

3.1.1 are acting in an appropriate manner concerning research data   
conform to all ethical legal and professional obligations relevant to their work   
nurture a research environment that makes data open wherever practical and affordable   
3.1.4 use transparent, robust and fair processes to make decisions concerning data openness  

3.1.5 have appropriate mechanisms in place to provide assurances as to the integrity of their research data and 3.1.6 recognise the importance of data citation and credit acknowledgement  

4 Scope

6.1.1.6 textual source materials, archival material and annotations  

Data Management Planning  

6.2.1 A data management plan is an essential part of research study design and methodology. RGU requires that a data management plan is completed as part of any research project submission where the funder requires it. In addition, RGU requires that a data management plan is completed in every other case where data will be transferred between partners / collaborators.  

Information Governance  

6.3.1   The  Information  Governance  Policy  discharges  the University's legislative obligations for data protection, sharing of information and records management of which research data is a part.  

6.3.2  Extra consideration should be given to research projects involving personal data including; 6.3.2.1 if the processing of personal data will result in a high risk to the individuals concerned. A Data Privacy Impact Assessment should be completed before data is collected. 6.3.2.2 compliance with the seven data protection principles and individual's rights set out in the UK General Data Protection Regulations.  

Consent for Data Sharing  

6.4.1 Obtaining appropriate consent for data sharing must be a key action for all researchers. This may require consent from research participants to share data about them, or consent from research partners to make the results of data open and available.  

Infrastructure  

6.5.1 The University will provide mechanisms and services for storage, backup, registration, deposit and retention of research data assets in support of current and future access, during and after completion of research projects.  

Storing Data
