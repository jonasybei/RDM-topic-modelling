## RESEARCH DATA MANAGEMENT  

### Purpose and Context  

RGU recognises that good research is underpinned and validated by good data. Research data provides the evidence of academic endeavours and in conjunction with publications, forms an important part of the scholarly record. Research data is a valuable asset and good management of research data brings benefits to the researcher, the University and the wider community. All researchers at RGU create or use some type of data as part the research process.  

Responsible handling of research data provides a clear indication that the institution and individual researchers are operating with integrity.  

Sharing research data appropriately enhances the value and impact of research, therefore, RGU supports:  

the UkRl position that publicly funded research data is a public good and that it should be made openly available with as few restrictions as possible in a timely and responsible manner  

1.3.1.1 "Publicly funded" includes any research undertaken whilst employed or studying at RGU, including where studies are self-funded. Specific contractual arrangements relating to research funded by a commercial interest may be put in place on a case by case basis  

1.3.2 the principles set out in the Concordat on Open Research Data the UKRI common principles on data policy  

1.3.4 the FAIR data principles  

RGU advocates an open access approach to research data wherever possible. However, open access needs to be balanced with the constraints of security, confidentiality and commercial interest.

This policy provides detailed information to supplement the RGu Research Governance and Integrity policy. Safe and ethical handling of data is a fundamental part of good practice for research, demonstrating; honesty, rigour, transparency and open communication, care and respect. The RGU Information Governance Policy also provides context, with explicit explanation of the legislative environment governing the handling of any personal data.  

### Legislation and Standards  

Researchers are responsible for making themselves familiar with and adhering to legislation, ethical standards, (in particular NHs Ethics Committee requirements & Caldicott), regulatory requirements and contractual obligations including funder policies that pertain to their research.  

Key legislation includes; the Data Protection Act (2o18) and General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) (2O18), the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act (2002), Intellectual Property Rights (2014), and Copyright (1988).  

The UK government promotes open research data as part of all the research it funds including research commissioned with industry and HEI partners.  

Concordat on Open Research Data  

In keeping with the principles outlined in the Concordat on Open Research Data RGU aims to demonstrate that the research community;  

are acting in an appropriate manner concerning research data   
conform to all ethical legal and professional obligations relevant to their work .1.3 nurture a research environment that makes data open wherever practical and affordable   
use transparent, robust and fair processes to make decisions concerning data openness  

![](images/21aa10b17dd822ca587817ceb81d9cee928e4e9281edb8e849cda7bc88add61e.jpg)  

have appropriate mechanisms in place to provide assurances as to the integrity of their research data and recognise the importance of data citation and credit acknowledgement  

### 4. Scope  

This policy covers all types of research that is expected to result in published findings of lasting scholarly value including:  

collection and creation of new data for the purposes of research   
use or re-use of data already created or collated elsewhere for the purposes of research   
data used as part of externally funded research in accordance with funder's requirements   
4.1.4 data used for internally funded research whether carried out as part of normal salaried scholarly activity or for specific internal funding streams.   
data used or created by research students studying at RGu. This is classed as "publicly funded" regardless of personal student financial arrangements  

It applies to any individual affiliated with the University including Emeritus, Visiting and Associate staff, and those with no formal affiliation, who conduct research on University premises or using University facilities. This policy applies across all research disciplines.

Definition of Research Data  

"Research data' is defined as any recorded information necessary to support or validate a research project's observations, analysis, findings or outputs, regardless of format or funding stream. It can include data specifically created or collated for the study, or use of data collected or created elsewhere which is being re-used. It includes, but is not limited to:  

6.1.1.1 results of experiments/simulations   
6.1.1.2 statistics and measurements   
6.1.1.3 algorithms, models and software   
6.1.1.4 observations, survey results, interview transcripts and recordings   
6.1.1.5 images, designs, physical artefacts and samples   
6.1.1.6 textual source materials, archival material and annotations  

Data Management Planning  

6.2.1 A data management plan is an essential part of research study design and methodology. RGU requires that a data management plan is completed as part of any research project submission where the funder requires it. In addition, RGU requires that a data management plan is completed in every other case where data will be transferred between partners / collaborators.  

Information Governance  

The Information Governance Policy discharges the University's legislative obligations for data protection, sharing of information and records management of which research data is a part.  

![](images/34599607debdcfc1f7c71f89afddac7cd157d8fd1fab3804dd9c0e33cb22b9c2.jpg)  

6.3.2 Extra consideration should be given to research projects involving personal data including;  

6.3.2.1 if the processing of personal data will result in a high risk to the individuals concerned. A Data Privacy Impact Assessment should be completed before data is collected.   
6.3.2.2 compliance with the seven data protection principles and individual's rights set out in the UK General Data Protection Regulations.  

Consent for Data Sharing  

6.4.1 Obtaining appropriate consent for data sharing must be a key action for all researchers. This may require consent from research participants to share data about them, or consent from research partners to make the results of data open and available.  

Infrastructure  

6.5.1 The University will provide mechanisms and services for storage, backup, registration, deposit and retention of research data assets in support of current and future access, during and after completion of research projects.  

Storing Data  

During the active phase of research, data will be stored on the University's research data facilities. Research data must not be stored on a personal drive, including H:\drive, personal devices, home computers and so forth.  

6.6.2 Researchers may need to make arrangements for:  

6.6.2.1 physical security - controlling access to rooms or cabinets, creation of "safe haven' facilities   
6.6.2.2logged access to media and hardware   
6.6.2.3adequate backup and retrieval  

![](images/263b06979512cf11f4cc85fe34aa5cae9c48b6528b6d5dedb8f59de09af050d9.jpg)  

RAE and REF rules have always allowed for data as one of the many different forms of output to be submitted for assessment, but such submissions are rare. RGU promotes the concept of research data as an output, created and curated suitably for submission in research assessment exercises.  

6.7.2 Researchers at RGU should deposit data sets as open data on the RGU repository, or on other suitable academic repositories. In cases where consent to share open data has not been obtained, meta-data should be deposited. Any data which is retained elsewhere, for example in an international data repository must be registered with the University and rights of access maintained.  

Intellectual Property & Copyright  

Researchers must not hand over to commercial publishers or agents exclusive rights to reuse or publish research data without retaining the rights to make the data openly available for re-use, unless this is a condition of funding.  

ORCiD  

6.9.1 All researchers at RGU, including research students, will register for an ORCid which will be recorded on the research information system. ORciD ensures that outputs (including data) are correctly identified with the appropriate academic.  

## Implementation  

Schools are responsible for implementing this policy through their standard operating procedures. These should include:  

Data management planning Data documentation and metadata Sharing data between collaborators Storing data and infrastructure
