# Policy on Research Data Management1  

# 1. Foreword  

The University of Padova recognises the fundamental importance of the data produced during the research activity. Therefore, it recognises the importance of their management for maintaining the quality of scientific research and is committed to applying the highest standards for their collection, archiving and preservation.  

The University of Padova acknowledges that reliable and easily available research data are at the basis of any research project and are also necessary for the verification of reliability and correctness of the project's conduction and results and for its reproducibility.  

The University of Padova acknowledges that research data are an asset of the university institution, as well as a resource - also in the long term - for research, university teaching and the progress of society.  

For the purposes of the present policy, the definition of "research data" and "pertaining to the University of Padova" shall be considered, as per annex 1.  

# 2. Scope of application  

The present "policy" shall apply to all the research projects of the University, limited to the parts for which it is responsible through its members who are bound to observe it. In the event that the research has been funded by third parties and specific agreements exist regarding data control, access and storage, such agreements shall prevail over this policy.  

# 3. Processing of research data  

In compliance with the current legislation on the protection of personal data and intellectual property, as well as with the provisions contained in the Statute and in the regulations of the University, and without prejudice to the specific research funding agreements stipulated with third parties, research data, once published, are archived and made freely available for use for scientific or historical research purposes, or in the public interest.  

Research data must be archived in the digital archive of the University of Padova (https://researchdata.cab.unipd.it/) or in a digital archive that respects international standards.  

These data must be stored in a correct, complete and reliable way, respecting their integrity. They must also be accessible, identifiable, traceable, interoperable and, where possible, available for subsequent use (FAIR principles2 ).  

In cases where there are no third-party rights to the data and no uses prohibited by law, research data can be associated with a free use licence (e. g. Creative Commons), ensuring traceability of uses and credit to the original source.  

The minimum duration of the archiving period is 10 years from the release of the results to the public.   
After this period, the data may be deleted unless there are still significant research interests.  

# 4. Responsibilities, duties, rights  

4.1 The responsibility for the collection, management and maintenance of data is shared between the members of the University of Padova and the University itself, within the limits of their respective spheres of competence.  

It is the responsibility of the members of the University of Padova to manage the research data and datasets, namely:  

- Collection, documentation, archiving, access, use and preservation (or destruction) of the research data, including the definition of protocols and responsibilities in the research group that are to be included in a Data Management Plan (DMP)3   compiled, where provided for by contracts with research funders or other legal entities, already in the initial phase of the project;   
- Elaboration and updating of the DMP and definition of the rights of use of the data after the end of the project;   
- If the researcher decides not to use the institutional archive "Research Data UniPd", he/she must ensure that the different archive used complies with FAIR standards, in any case respecting the institutional and legal or contractual requirements relating to research data and the management of the records describing them.  

It is the responsibility of the research project manager to define which of the data must be stored, taking into account the duties resulting from contracts with third parties.  

# 4.2 Responsibility of the University of Padua  

It is the responsibility of the University:  

To provide adequate resources, tools and infrastructures in terms of software and hardware suitable for data retention and compliant with this policy.   
To provide assistance for the design and compilation of DMPs.   
To develop services and mechanisms for project registration, to enable the deposit, storage and preservation of research data and to maintain their accessibility during and at the end of the research project. To ensure that members of the University of Padova can exercise their responsibilities and fulfil their obligations under contracts with research funders or other legal entities.   
Make backup copies.  

# 5. Validity  

This “policy” comes into force on 1 December 2018 and will be updated periodically.  

# Definition of Research Data  

Research data are factual records (numerical data, symbols, texts, images or sounds) used as primary sources of scientific research necessary to validate research results.  

# Definition of members of the University of Padua (to whom the present policy applies)  

Professors, researchers, PhD students, research fellows, postgraduates, technical and administrative staff involved in research activities.  

To support the definition of research data, the source considered for the current definition is attached, from LERU Roadmap for Research Data (LERU Research Data Working Group, Advice Paper No. 14 – December 2014):  

“Research data, from the point of view of the institution with a responsibility for managing the data, includes: All data which is created by researchers in the course of their work, and for which the institution has a curational responsibility for at least as long as the code and relevant archives/record keeping acts require, and third-party data which have originated within the institution or come from elsewhere.” 4
